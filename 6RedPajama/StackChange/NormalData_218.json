["Q: How to investigate display problems? I'm running Kubuntu 15.04 and from time to time my display turns completely black. The only thing then that's visible to me is the mouse pointer and after pressing ALT+F2 the \"command run dialog\".\nSince I'm new to Kubuntu I'm not sure where to start looking for hints on the problem that would narrow down possible problem sources. Which log files etc. do I have to look for?\n\nA: Today I encountered the same problem.\nLet's do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + F1\n\n*Log in as root\n\n*Type startx and hit Enter\nIt should tell you if the X has encountered any problem and where the log file is.\nIf the X is already running, let's restart it using sudo service sddm restart\n", "Q: I would like to install SAMBA on my UBUNTU desktop I would like to install/configure SAMBA to share a Folder on my UBUNTU desktop with my Windows servers and client.\nWhat do I need to download/configure to do this?\nThank You\n\nA: sudo apt-get install samba\n\nThat will install SAMBA.

Next, I've installed Ubuntu 14.04.3. After using Boot-Repair to fix Ubuntu boot, it seems that Grub always detects the Windows 10 as recovery mode although I still can boot my Windows 10 up via that recovery mode menu entry.\nCould anyone please guide me fix this grub issue ?\nThanks,\n\nA: This is nothing you should worry about !  \nGRUB detects all boot loaders ... the first Windows boot loader detected was the one that points to the Windows Recovery Environment.  \nThe \"complete\" Windows Boot Environment will be started when you select Windows Recovery Environment from GRUB menu entries.  \nSo it is just a misleading \"wrong\" name.\n\nA: Add an entry to 40_custom in /etc/grub.d/ directory, with the entry\nthat update-grub generated suitably edited to reflect that you really\nare booting the real Windows installation.\n", "Q: Can my local host get attacked if I don't port forward? Can my local host get attacked if I don't port forward?\nI'm currently running a server which for a certain app, I'm having problems with passwords and decided that is easier if I leave them default, Can this leave me in a vulnerable spot even if I don't port forward?\n\nA: If you have zero ports forwarded through your firewall you should be safe from an internet based attack.

Thanks.\n", "Q: How can I create an animated GIF in Ubuntu using a set of images? I have a set of about 500 JPEG images. The collective size of the set is about 60 MB and each image has the dimensions 480 x 270. I want to convert these images to an animated GIF.\nI have attempted to convert these images to animated GIF in the following way on my i7 system with 16 GB of RAM:\nexport MAGICK_THREAD_LIMIT=1\nconvert -delay 5 -loop 0 -layers optimize -limit memory 64 *.jpg output.gif\n\nHowever, when I do this, so much of the system resources are taken up that the system becomes unusable and grinds to a halt.\nSo, what would be a good way to make an animated GIF on Ubuntu?\n\nA: The following procedure prevents ImageMagick from consuming excessive system resources. It has been tested with ImageMagick 6.8.9-9 on Ubuntu 15.04. To illustrate the procedure, I use the example of converting a video to an animated GIF.\nSet up ImageMagick such that it doesn't consume excessive system resources:\nexport MAGICK_MEMORY_LIMIT=1024\nexport MAGICK_MAP_LIMIT=1024\nexport MAGICK_AREA_LIMIT=4096\nexport MAGICK_FILES_LIMIT=1024\nexport MAGICK_THREAD_LIMIT=1\nexport MAGICK_TMPDIR=/home/user/tmp\n\nThe environment variable MAGICK_THREAD_LIMIT limits the number of threads used by ImageMagick (when it is built with OpenMP enabled). The environment variable MAGICK_TMPDIR is a path to a directory at which ImageMagick can store temporary files. It is particularly useful for frame images of relatively large size because it avoids excessive RAM memory usage.\nPrepare the input filename, the output filename and the directory at which frame images are to be stored.\nfilename1=2015-11-09T1300Z.mp4\nfilename2=2015-11-09T1300Z.gif\ndirectoryName1=\"tmp_images\"\n\nConvert the video to a number of frame images (setting the time limits as appropriate; in this example, from 0 seconds to 30 seconds).\nmplayer -ao null -ss 0:00:00 -endpos 30 \"${filename1}\" -vo jpeg:outdir=\"${directoryName1}\":quality=100\n\nIf reasonable for output file size constraints, reduce the size of the video frames (in this example, by 50%).\nmogrify -resize 50% \"${directoryName1}\"/*.jpg\n\nUse ImageMagick to convert the frame images to an animated GIF.\nconvert -delay 5 -loop 0 -layers optimize -limit memory 64 \"${directoryName1}\"/*.jpg \"${filename2}\"\n\n", "Q: Kate is missing all button icons After removing KDE and switching to xfce, I discovered that Kate has lost all button icons, while Kile has not.

I changed the resolution and my screen went crazy. Just one flat colour with no components. Only a few random squares.\nI've searched and the task seems pretty challenging to me.\nIs there an easy way to fix this?\nMany thanks!\n\nA: I'm not an expert on this, but I think you need to be sure you graphics card and screen both support the resolution you are trying to set.\nTry this to test: xrandr --fb 1680x1080.\nIf the resolution doesn't change, your system doesn't support a bigger resolution than it is already set.\nIf it changes, it may change to a different resolution than expected. Check that by running xrandr and looking for the resolution:\nLVDS connected primary WxH+0+0.\nAn apparent workaround would be to scale up your resolution with:\nxrandr --output LVDS --scale-from 1680x1080\nIt is not the same (characters appear blurry) but it works.\n\nA: Don't set the refresh rate in the cvt command; let your monitor do all the work:\ncvt 1680 1080\n\nYou're using your monitor name as LVDS, but it would be a good idea to check what xrandr detects:\nxrandr | grep \" connected \" | awk '{ print$1 }'\n\nAnd last of all, don't use sudo!\n", "Q: Fan is on constantly after recent update Prior to a recent update Fancontrol started at boot, and everything was fine.\nNow after the fan doesn't stop. To solve it, every time I turn on the PC I have to set up pwmconfig again. Then I have to run \nsudo fancontrol\n\nWhich makes the fans controlled as they should be. I don't understand why I have to go through all this on every boot. The pwmconfig part in paticular puzzles me. I have the file set up (/etc/fancontrol) but if I try running fancontrol before pwmconfig it says:\n\"Device name of hwmon1 has changed\nConfiguration appears to be outdated, please run pwmconfig again\"\n\nA: Found the answer, just reinstalling it fixed it:\n    sudo apt-get purge fancontrol && sudo apt-get install fancontrol\n\n\nA: Since this is the first web search hit for this error, the upstream bug is:  https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors/issues/227\nThe corresponding ubuntu bug has been open for ten years:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lm-sensors-3/+bug/576602\nThe arch advice:  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fan_speed_control#Device_Paths_have_Changed_in_%2Fetc%2Ffancontrol\nThe problem is that the hwmon device numbers can change every boot, and pwmconfig / fancontrol do not handle it.  The workaround I've used is specifying the kernel module load order via /etc/modprobe.d/fancontrol.conf as described in detail in the ubuntu and arch links.

For convenience during development (not sure yet if I will do this in production), I decided to install desktop (via tasksel) on 14.04 server, to allow interaction with this machine via both desktop and cmd-line, including in the latter case using gnu screen. (using alt-fn keys to get to terminals). This is to learn to interact without presence of the desktop, yet in this case for max. convenience also have the desktop available. But it's fully intended that this setup is for a server that will eventually go into production and therefore security matters a lot.\nWhat I understand: apt-get in 14.04 server will not automatically upgrade to 14.10, this being LTS release policy (it says updates 'held back').\nYet when I am in the desktop, software update is telling me I have a security update. If I understand correctly this is really the kernel updates which make up 14.10 upgrade.\nWhich messages should I rely on?  Should I just ignore what desktop software update says?  A bit uncomfortable doing that. \n\nA: Desktop software updater asks explicitly about updating to the next version. So, if it's about 14.10 then it'll be stated as such.\nKernel updates can come any time. And they don't mean that the distribution version will change.\n", "Q: How do I set up a wireless connection after install Ubuntu Server 15.10?

You can check this from the terminal:\nrfkill list all\n\nHard blocked:yes indicates that the wireless is blocked by the hardware switch or button. Find it and change it.\nTo set up the wireless in a server, I suggest you set up /etc/network/interfaces something like:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto wlp3s0\niface wlp3s0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.150\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nwpa-ssid <your_router>\nwpa-psk <your_wpa_key>\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\n\nBe sure to select a static address outside the range used by the DHCP server in the router, switch or other access point. Of course, substitute your details here. Confirm that your wireless interface is wlp3s0 with the terminal command:\niwconfig\n\nGet the system to read and use the changes:\nsudo ifdown wlp3s0 && sudo ifup -v wlp3s0\n\nDid you connect?\nping -c3 192.168.1.1\nping -c3 www.ubuntu.com\n\n", "Q: how to remove usr/lib/java/jdk/1.8.0_45 I can't recall what I did wrong but i have a folder named \"usr/lib/java/jdk/1.8.0_45\"\nthat has a desktop for itself in it and all that, basicly an user for itself and all my pictures get saved in there and sometimes it messes with my downloads but I can't remove it in system settings/users.

certificates, but to be honest I don't know very much about things like this. Thanks for any eventual help. I'm still lost here. Does anyone have any idea of where to start?\nOk, now I've got some help, but I can't seem to figure out how to this anyway.\nI have tested follow versions of Java:\n\n\n*\n\n*Oracle Java 8\n\n*OpenJRE 8\n\n*Oracle Java 9\n\nA: After testing and working with the awesome people in the FTB IRC, we got it to work. We changed a few things around (like linking cacerts into java's binary), but what actually fixed it was this command. Here you go :)\nsudo update-ca-certificates --fresh\n\n\nA: The answer is to actually install java the right way at the first time, I have issues on the main machine I was trying to use even after this partly, what happened was I wrote a wrong command and everything got messed up.I tried to remove the package ca-certificates and it brought down half of Ubuntu... a clean re-installation with hours of reconfiguration was the result, so I can't recreate the issue anymore. \nTo the solution now : \n I suggest you remove every java installation and clean the folder for java manually as well. Now you could install a package called default-jre and that should do the trick. \nWhat it does is that it installs a package called ca-cetficates-java\nsudo apt-get install default-jre\n\n    The following extra packages will be installed:\n  ca-certificates-java default-jre-headless fonts-dejavu-extra java-common libatk-wrapper-java libatk-wrapper-java-jni libgif4 libgnomevfs2-0       libgnomevfs2-common libsctp1 lksctp-tools openjdk-7-jre openjdk-7-jre-headless tzdata-java\n\nit will then bring the certificates needed for minecraft to work! it is as simple as that. \nOLD:I have the same issue, it needs still more certificates but the latest error log doesn't say what site it tries to reach. a solution would be to make java accept any certificate. \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1828775/how-to-handle-invalid-ssl-certificates-with-apache-httpclient\n\nA: I was having this problem, but sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh didn't fix it. Turns out my version of icedtea was outdated relative to my verion of nss.\n\nA: I could solve that error by using openjdk-8 instead of openjdk-11. To find out which version of java you use, type java --version in your terminal. By default, openjdk-java is installed at /usr/lib/jvm/java-$version-openjdk-$platform (where $version is the version e.g. 8 and $platform is the platform e.g. amd64). Should you find version 8 there, you can run the launcher with /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -jar FTB_launcher.jar\n", "Q: Web server woes - only display home page on all sites I'm running Ubuntu server 15 and am migrating all my websites, a combo of Wordpress and drupal sites to the new server - from Ubuntu server 14.

However, this resulted in the laptop just booting into windows with no grub appearing.\nI consequently tried a variety of things. For example I followed the steps outlined in this guide:\n\n*\n\n*Disabled UEFI secure boot and Windows 10 fast boot option\n\n*Reinstalled again Ubuntu 14.04 from the USB\n\n*Ran boot-repair from the ubuntu live installation. Boot-repair completed without giving errors.

Rebooting the system however the GRUB still doesn't show up. I also tried the slightly different version of the same command given in the above linked page, but still no luck.\n\nI'm not sure what else I can try to make it work, I've never had such problems in installing a linux distribution alongside Windows on other laptops.\nAny help is appreciated at this point.\nUpdate\nI did found a way to boot into Ubuntu through the GRUB. Holding down F11 during the booting process, Windows will boot into the blue \"safe mode\". In there if you select the \"chose a booting device\" option you will have the choice to boot from a series of devices, including GRUB and Ubuntu (which however both result in booting from the GRUB). Here is a photo of this menu (sorry for the non-english language, the title says \"Use a device\"):\n\nWhile this method works, it is obviously a pain to have to do this procedure every time, but this proves that grub is installed correctly. \"Only\" the boot loader priority seems to be messed up.

It based on the info in the link oldfred posted.\nProblem\nI had the same problem on a HP Laptop. There are a lot of laptops which love to boot windows as priority despite what you configure. You need to overwrite the windows boot manager with the grub. It's a bit of a hack, but it's worked great for me and others. Windows will overwrite this every time it updates.\nSolution\nI created an SH (script file) with the following commands and run it as sudo. (make sure your boot partition is mounted at /boot/efi, which it should be by default)\n7z a /boot/efi/EFI_`date +\\%d\\%m\\%Y`.7z /boot/efi/EFI/\ncp -a /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/* /boot/efi/EFI/Boot/\nmv /boot/efi/EFI/Boot/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\ncp /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/\nmv /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi\n\nNotes\nThe script basically backs up the current EFI configuration (using 7zip, modify this to your preferred flavor of backup), then overwrites the efi boot scripts of the windows boot manager.\nIt will need to be run everytime windows does a major update.\n\nA: Tried this command in your windows cmd (as administrator)\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nIf that not works, try this\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\bootx64.efi\n\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.04 wireless drivers I have been trying to get wireless drivers for a long time now.

However, VGA all works fine with Windows. \n\nA: I found a solution to this problem. Firstly, let me explain my problem if it fits with your problem.\nMy display is LG Flatron W2243S. It supports 1920x1080. But although I connect it to my PC via VGA, it is detected as unknown display and I can't use more than 1024x768 efficiently. I mean there is 1280x720 as maximum resolution in the settings of that 'unknown display' and if I choose it, I lost the left quarter of the screen, namely the mouse arrow disappears in that left quarter region.\nAfter some research I found a solution that works for me. I replaced the VGA cable and screen is detected as '22\" Display' not 'LG ...sth.'. However, I can choose 1920x1080 finally and it works perfectly.\nTo sum up, problem is caused by VGA cable and I replaced it with another one.\n", "Q: Can't install or uninstall software.

What should I try out?\n\nA: I solved the problem by removing all drives from the ASMedia SATA ports that use the rogue ASM1061 controller.\nInitially I had connected a DVD drive to the ASM1061 controller, but now I saw in the motherboard specs that these ports are only to be used with hard disk drives (see here footnote 4). I moved the DVD to a SATA Express port (also ASMedia), and now everything works. This is a bit strange, because according to the motherboard specs, this port is also only for hard drives.

Apparently Java Assistive Technology doesn't run on the openjdk-11-jre package. I believe there is also a way to specify which Java version to run, but I don't know it off the top of my head and I'm sure there's another post on that topic.\n\nA: Inspired from Marco's answer, but for me it only works in this order (prepending):\njava -Djavax.accessibility.assistive_technologies=\" \" -jar aprof-plot.jar\n\nIt solved the problem and the program launched successfully (in my case argouml.jar fakesmtp.jar).\nUsing Java 8 on Ubuntu 2019.04\n\nA: I ran into this same error on my Ubuntu 15.10 server but did not want to install the non-headless version of OpenJDK due to the number of additional dependencies. A simpler solution was to simply disable assistive technologies.\nThis can be done by editing the accessibility.properties file for OpenJDK 8 (change the version to whichever is actually in use on your system):\nsudo vim /etc/java-8-openjdk/accessibility.properties\n\nComment out the following line:\n#assistive_technologies=org.GNOME.Accessibility.AtkWrapper\n\n\nAlso you can edit this line programmatically:\nsudo sed -i -e '/^assistive_technologies=/s/^/#/' /etc/java-*-openjdk/accessibility.properties\n\n\nA: For those who do not have root access on their machines to change the configuration file or do not want to install the full JRE: append -Djavax.accessibility.assistive_technologies=\" \" to your command, e.g.\n$ java -jar aprof-plot.jar -Djavax.accessibility.assistive_technologies=\" \"\n\nDo note that the \" \" is important, simply using \"nothing\" as parameter will cause the JRE to still load whatever is set in /etc/java-8-openjdk/accessibility.properties.\n\nA: This kind of error happens when you have a headless version of the JRE installed. The headless JRE is a subset of the full JRE but lacks GUI features, including support for assistive technologoes.\nInstall the full JRE (e.g. openjdk11-jre instead of openjdk11-jre-headless) and the error should go away.

I've included palettes  for some popular terminal emulator as\n  well as Xdefaults in the official  Solarized download available from\n  [Solarized homepage]. If you use  Solarized without these colors,\n  Solarized will need to be told to degrade its colorscheme to a set\n  compatible with the limited 256 terminal palette (whereas  by using\n  the terminal's 16 ansi color values, you can set the correct, specific\n  values for the Solarized palette).\nIf you do use the custom terminal colors, solarized.vim should work\n  out of the box for you. If you are using a terminal emulator that\n  supports 256 colors and  don't want to use the custom Solarized\n  terminal colors, you will need to use  the degraded 256 colorscheme.\n  To do so, simply add the following line before  the colorschem \n  solarized line:\nlet g:solarized_termcolors=256\n\nAgain, I recommend just changing your terminal colors to Solarized\n  values  either manually or via one of the many terminal schemes\n  available for import.\n\nWhat worked for me on Ubuntu 16.04 with the included Terminal application was to simply select Solarized for both \"Text and Background Color\" (choose light or dark) and \"Palette\" in Terminal > Preferences > Profiles > (select yours) > Edit > Colors\nSome other answers recommend choosing a 256 color palette but, as mentioned in the documentation, this gives you a degraded (and visibly worse in my opinion) colorscheme.\n", "Q: Why is khubd process using too much of my CPU? analyzing the process manager I found that the khubd process uses more CPU than other processes all that are running.

Which name and extension?\n\n*How can I use it, after that, in a LXTerminal session, with only one order (ideally if there would be a way to use it automatically each time the system is starting)?\nThanks a lot for your time!\n\nA: What is called in the Windows world a \"batch\" file, is called a \"script\" in *NIX world. For the most part, scripts are a file with multiple commands or commands arranged in specific ways. Here's couple of things you should know:\nBasic structure\nTypically you will see something like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Comments \nprintf \"Hello world\"\n\nFirst line specifies an interpreter ( commonly refereed to as shebang line ), second is a comment ( anything after # is not interpreted, just plain text ), third one is actual command\nIn terminal  you can call a file without the shebang line. That will cause  the script to be read and interpreted by your current shell ( aka command interpreter ). For instance, I am running mksh shell. I specify the #!/bin/sh it will be ran by Ubuntu's default shell - dash.  Every shell has some specifics about its' syntax of commands, hence you have to tailor your script accordingly.\nWriting script\nThis has to be done in text editor, but you could also write it in LibreOffice Writer and then save it in plain text. Personally , I just use command line text editors (nano for the most part or vim ); analogy here would be edit in pre-Windows 7 versions of Windows.\nFile names and extensions don't matter on *NIX systems , as the system reads the file's first several bytes to determine its type. I got into habbit adding .sh extension, but really - it's unnecessary.\nMake script executable\nThat is made using chmod 755 scriptName.sh command. It means read-write-execute permissions for owner (you) read-execute for users who are in owner's group (for instance file owner could be admin, so if you belong to admin group, you can read and execute the file ), and read-execute for anybody else. Never give write permissions to others ! If you have super user privileges that could result into some bad juju ( aka you could get hacked, and malicious user will change your scripts so that it stills your personal info ).\nRunning scripts\nYou could always run a script by navigating to the script location in terminal and typing ./scriptName.\nTo run any command anywhere, including scripts, they must be stored somewhere on the system that is included into the $PATH variable. Here's what I mean:\n$ echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/xieerqi/bin\n\n$PATH variable tells me that if a script or executable binary file is located in /usr/local/sbin or /usr/local/bin or any other of those directories, I can run that command just by typing it into the terminal.\nNow, for your own scripts, you should make bin folder, and store the scripts there. If you are using bash your .profile configuration file contains the following lines:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\n#if [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n#    PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\n#fi\n\nIf you uncomment (remove # ) in front of last three lines (from if to fi), your personal bin folder will be included into the $PATH variable.\n\nA: There are no \"batch\" files in the unix-like world. We use scripts containing \"she-bangs\". To make a script like this, open up a text editor (like Leafpad) and start with a line like this:\n#!/path/to/interpreter\n\nWhere /path/to/interpreter is the location of the binary that will be used to interpret your script. In Linux we usually use \"bash\" (Bourne Again SHell), an \"evolution\" of the good ol' Bourne Shell. What bash does is basically running binaries with arguments specified in the script from paths included in the PATH environment variable (it usually includes /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin and others).\nBut you can also use other interpreters such as Python, Perl, Ruby, sh, csh, zsh, dash, ksh, besides tons of options.\nBelow the she-bang comes your script. In your specific case, to run the specified commands, we can use bash, in a script like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# the line above sets bash as the interpreter\n\n# note that \"sudo\" is not required here because we will run the script as super user later.\n\napt-get update\n# updates APT repositories\n\napt-get upgrade\n# check for software upgrades and upgrade them\n\napt-get autoremove\n# remove obsolete packages\n\napt-get autoclean\n# remove stored .deb files\n\napt-get check\n# update package cache and check for broken dependencies\n\nNow save your file. There is no need for an extension, but for symbolic reasons, name it with a .sh extension. We'll run the script as super user, so there's no need to change file permissions.\nOpen a terminal and cd to the path where you saved your script. Let's say you saved it as script.sh. Run the following command:\nchmod +x script.sh\n\nchmod means \"change mode\", and is used to change who can do what with your script. +x adds the execute permission for all users, which allows anyone to run the script as though it's any other program. I won't go into a full list of what all the different permissions mean, but this question summarises them fairly well. After that, you can type:\nsudo ./script.sh\n\nDon't forget the ./ part and don't leave any spaces between the ., the / and the s. The sudo command will run ./script.sh with root privileges, so your password will be required (you have to be the system admin, of course). \n", "Q: Can I Get the Unity Desktop Terminal on Ubuntu GNOME? I'm currently running Ubuntu GNOME, but I really would like to know if I can get the standard purple backgrounded terminal that comes with the \"regular\" Ubuntu install and the Unity Desktop. My terminal works fine; I just think that the Unity terminal is nicer to look at.\n\n\nA: They are actually the same (gnome-terminal), but with different color schemes.\nIf you have the Unity desktop, first create a new temporary user and login with it into Unity. Run a terminal and close it. Now log off and access GNOME with your regular user again. Open a terminal and run these commands: \nsudo rm -rf $HOME/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal\nsudo cp -rf /home/tmp-username/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal $HOME/.gconf/apps\n\nreplacing tmp-username with the name of the temporary user you just created. After running the command you can delete this user. Run gnome-terminal again and now you should see the Unity style.\n", "Q: Can't get my ntfs partitions UUID in 15.10 I installed Ubuntu 15.10, and I can't mount my NTFS partitions I searched a lot and found few solutions and tried them but the funny thing is that everytime I get the UUID's that the partitions had when I had OS X Lion on my PC and now the partitions are different and the UUID's that I write in fstab after entering mount command says there is no such a partitions.

However, I use the Dvorak layout and haven't been able to find a way to input Pinyin using the Dvorak layout - it defaults to QWERTY. Any ideas?\n\nA: I had this problem until maybe 10 minutes ago. The way I solved this was to get rid of all keyboards layouts on the system except for EN-Dvorak and Pinyin.\nThis seems to solve the problem since ibus on pinyin mode specifies the default keyboard layout used on the system in \"/usr/share/ibus/component/pinyin.xml\"\n<engine>\n...\n<layout>default</layout>\n...\n</engine>\n\nIf it can't find anything else other the dvorak then it is the default.

And what is HotSpare? I'm totally new to all this hard disks matter and even newer to topic with RAID.\nI hope somebody can help me!\nI have installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (BioLinux) on Dell Precision T7500, with Dell PERC 6/i Adapter RAID controller, but only 1.8TB usable.\nI have 8 disks, totaling up to 12TB, how do I activate and use them all?\nI created new Virtual disk and followed through the short guide from the below 2 links to install my BioLinux with USB stick.\nhttp://www.orangecomputers.com/node/?command=kb&docid=25\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llvGKVYSQ4A\nAfter successfully booting, gparted only showing 1.8TB size available and there is only 1MB of unallocated space.\nHow do I activate back the other disks and get the Ubuntu (BioLinux) run on total 12TB space (or at least 6TB)? Is it possible?\nSomething to tweak in the Configuration Utility? Use other levels of RAID?\nAnd what is \"HotSpare\"?? \nGreatly appreciate any help from anyone :)\n\nA: When you use RAID 1, the disks are all duplicates of each other.  If you have the 12 disks, the data will be duplicated 12 times up to the capacity of the smallest disk.\nWhat you want is either RAID 0, 5, 6, or 10.\nIn RAID 0, all the disks are used to store data with no redundancy.  The total space would be the smallest disk size * 8.\nIn RAID 5, data is stored with parity bits.  This allows a single disk to fail and data still be readable.  The size of the virtual disk would be the size of the smallest disk * 7.\nIn RAID 6, it is basicly the same as RAID 5 except data is stored with 2 differenty parity bits.  This means that 2 disks can fail and data is still recoverable.  The size of the virtual disk would be the size of the smallest disk * 6.\nIn RAID 10, is groups of disks in RAID 1 combined in RAID 0.  This allows for the possibility of multiple disks to fail as long as they are not in the same RAID 1 group.  The size of your RAID 1 groups will determine the final size of the array.\nNote not all RAID Controllers support RAID 5 & 10, but according to dell  your controller does support RAID (0,1,5,6,10)\n(http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/campaigns/dell-raid-controllers)\nHot Spares are used as spare disks in the RAID Array.  When a disk fails, (assuming it is a recoverable error) the array will recreate the data that was on the failed disk on the hot spare.\nOverall I would recommend NOT using RAID 0 unless the information you are storing in VERY UNIMPORTANT.  If ANY of the 8 disks would fail, it would mean the loss of all of your data.\nRAID 1 as you have found out crates many duplicates increasing read speed, but there is really no reason to put 8 disks in RAID 1.\nI would recommend either doing RAID 5, 6, or 10 depending on the disk space your require and the data integrity needed.\n", "Q: How do i setup OpenDNS family shield?

This feels like scrolling is not reliable and exact so I would really like to get rid of it.\nI don't think using VirtualBox is the problem since it doesn't happen in xfce4-terminal, and I configured the mouse to emulate a PS/2 mouse, not a touchpad. However I think this behaviour of gnome may be due to some default setting which is thought of being a good default for touchpads to prevent unintended scrolling or something like that.\nI didn't find any option to change this behaviour in the ubuntu mouse settings or the xfce4 mouse settings, and I didn't find anything useful when searching for options in gconf-editor or dconf-editor.\n\nA: This is a known bug happens when using Gnome+Xorg.

Every attempt to update to a newer version of any distro results in my screen becoming unusable. I have tried Debian based and RPM based distros.

One thing I have attempted is to hold back the driver updates prior to performing a dist-upgrade (sudo apt-mark hold xserver-xorg-video-nouveau) to seemingly no gain.\n\nA: While watching the TTY1 screen during boot from the LiveCD, I noticed an error come up “GPU Lockup - switching to software fbcon”. I found on another forum that when the boot options screen comes up (with the try, install, etc options on it), press F6 and select nomodeset from the list of options.

Here is the description of grep from GNU.org:\n\ngrep searches input files for lines containing a match to a given pattern list. When it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to standard output (by default), or produces whatever other sort of output you have requested with options.\n\nI have this command that I use often, which gives the name of the currently connected monitor:\nxrandr | grep \" connected \" | awk '{ print$1 }'\n\nI can't see any files in this command, or links to them, so what exactly is going on? Is grep used for other stuff apart from searching files?\n\nA: From man grep (emphasis mine):\ngrep  searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are\nnamed, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines\ncontaining  a  match to the given PATTERN.  By default, grep prints the\nmatching lines.\n\nAnd from the GNU docs (again, emphasis mine):\n\n2.4 grep Programs\ngrep searches the named input files for lines containing a match to\n  the given pattern. By default, grep prints the matching lines. A file\n  named - stands for standard input. If no input is specified,\n  grep searches he working directory . if given a command-line\n  option specifying recursion; otherwise, grep searches standard\n  input.\n\nThe standard input, in this  case, is the pipe connected to xrandr's standard output.\nThe grep is superfluous in this case; awk can do the job by itself:\nxrandr | awk '/ connected /{print $1}'\n\n\nA: When you do:\nxrandr | grep \" connected \"\n\nyou are basically redirecting the standard output (file descriptor 1, /dev/stdout) of xrandr to the standard input (file descriptor 0, /dev/stdin) of grep, this is the job of the pipe.\nAs grep takes input from standard input when no file name is given, your command will succeed as far as the file is concerned.\nYou can think of it as:\ngrep 'pattern' /dev/stdin\n\n\nYou can get the desired output with grep alone (no awk needed):\n% xrandr | grep -Po '^[^ ]+(?= connected)'\nLVDS1\n\nThis will get the first space separated word of the line (^[^ ]+) followed by a space and then the word connected ((?= connected) is a zero width positive lookahead pattern ensuring <space>connected is matched after the desired portion).\n", "Q: Restore warnings for file system (boot volume full) I accidentally hid a class of error messages from appearing again and I would like to unhide them.\nI received the message:\nThe volume “boot” has only ….. bytes disk space remaining\n\nwhile installing updates.

Open the key called org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.housekeeping  (or search for \"Disk Space\"). \nCheck the \"active\" box if it is not already active; or, if relevant, remove the path or partition from the ignore-paths parameter.\n\nAnother (non-GUI) way to turn warnings back on is to enter the equivalent command\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.housekeeping active true\n", "Q: Windows 10 boots instead of Linux Live USB (Ubuntu 15.10) - prior installed and deleted Ubuntu (GRUB is not functioning) Here is my problem I'm trying to solve in order to install Ubuntu 15.10.\nI already tried a several BIOs options in order to get the USB Stick to work.

I deleted this instance of ubuntu by simply removing it's partition under windows. I think this corrupted the data for grub which causes it to not function properly. I also tried to boot from the USB on another PC which worked fine. What should I try to do next? Thanks in advance.\nGreets\n\nA: First, know and understand your boot modes (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI)! If you're dual-booting, it's important that both OSes use the same boot mode. Fiddling with your boot-mode (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI) options in the firmware is more likely to cause problems than to solve them. If Windows was pre-installed on the system, it almost certainly used EFI/UEFI mode, so you should leave it set to boot in that way. See this page of mine for more on what BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is on an EFI/UEFI-based computer.\nTo properly diagnose your problem, you should run the Boot Info Script on the computer. (Use an Ubuntu live CD/USB drive for this purpose.) This will generate a file called RESULTS.txt, which holds tons of information on things like installed boot loaders. You can post the file to a pastebin site and post back here for help interpreting it. My hunch is that you installed an EFI-mode copy of GRUB (Ubuntu's default boot loader), then installed a BIOS-mode copy at some point. That's why launching the EFI-mode version (which is what shows up in the boot list as ubuntu) fails; it's expecting the EFI-mode configuration file but getting the BIOS-mode file, which it doesn't like. That's just a hunch, though.\nIf my hunch is correct, the solution is to install a working EFI-mode boot loader. There are two relatively easy ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool from an EFI-mode boot of the Ubuntu installation image (in its \"try before installing\" mode). This should replace the GRUB configuration files, as well as GRUB itself. This approach often works, but if my hypothesis about what's causing the problem is wrong, it might not work at all.\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive image of my rEFInd boot manager and prepare a boot image from it. If it's currently enabled, disable Secure Boot. You can then boot from the rEFInd medium and test that you can boot both Ubuntu and Windows. If so, boot into Ubuntu and install the PPA or Debian-package version of rEFInd, which should then take over the duties normally performed by GRUB. This approach has the advantage of enabling you to test the solution (rEFInd) before installing it to your hard disk.\n\n", "Q: How to mount a disk partition that has been created by the system I have a disk partition named \"LinuxAux\" which I have always opened by clicking on it from the \"Devices\" list on the left tab of Nautilus. \nDue to an accident, my laptop's battery ran out with LinuxAux mounted and when I rebooted it, after mounting the partition, the links to it were still broken. A new virtual device (not sure how to name it) called \"LinuxAux1\" has appeared in my /media/username/ folder and that one is the one that is mounted by Nautilus. It has the same content as what LinuxAux used to have so I redirected the links and everything works fine now.\nHowever LinuxAux is still on /media/username/ and I'd like to mount it to see what's inside, know if it it occupying more space or if it's just some phantom image. But my knowledge of the mount command is poor and I definitely don't know how to use it in this situation.\nSome (maybe) useful data:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Ubuntu 14.04 \n\n*When I boot the computer, the only thing that is in\n/media/username/ is an icon of a folder with a lock called LinuxAux. (not LinuxAux1)\n\n*On the left tab of Nautilus LinuxAux is listed, but it actually mounts LinuxAux1\n\n\nA: Have you tried mounting partition using Disk application which is come along Ubuntu installation?\nOpen Disk, then click on your expected to be Linux Aux partition (perhaps it shows the Linux Aux label). Then choose more actions (on the below partition bar with 2 gears icon). Choose Mount options.\nThere you can set it to mount at autostart, show it in nautilus, and also set the Mount Points.\nI think that's the easiest way.\n", "Q: Configuring the BIOS before installing Ubuntu Recently I was asked about whether Ubuntu go on laptop ASUS F552CL-X211H.\nNow I would like to know what you want to disable or, conversely, to include in the BIOS to make it work as it should.\n\nA: I can't comment on your specific hardware.\nYou need not disable or enable anything in the BIOS / UEFI before installing Ubuntu.\nIn particular, if you want to boot both Windows 8 or above that came with the computer and Ubuntu don't mess with your BIOS. See Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI for more information.\nOn the other hand, if you plan to completely remove Windows and replace it with Ubuntu, you may change the BIOS to legacy mode. It does not make any difference.\nPlease read the Ubuntu community documentation on UEFI and on UEFI Booting for more information.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Monitor visited websites of guest account through any browser I want to know which websites/URLs are visited by users of my home computer's guest account. \nIs there a way to log this and save it as nicely formatted list to the disk?

That too, results from a misunderstanding described above.\nThe way to achieve what you want is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a web proxy (preferably lightweight, such as tinyproxy).\n\n*Add iptables rules that redirect outgoing connections made by only a specific user to ports 80,443/tcp to the local proxy.\n\n\nWhat I had in mind is described here (not my post). This way you get a web proxy log which has all the HTTP requests logged. You won't get logs related to SSL protected traffic though, which is a good thing.\nTo reiterate: URLs are not part of the IP or TCP header structure, thus something working on the IP/TCP level isn't going to be able to show you this data, unless it has some TCP dissector (tcpdump/wireshark are able to do this but not iptables alone).\n\nA: Have you tried this:\nsudo iptables -A output -m owner --uid-owner 499 -j log --log-prefix=\"'/var/log/kern.log$'uri\"\n\nand it might help fine this way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 - jboss wildfly 9.0.2.Final, Eclipse Mars crash due to JVM error After I upgrade to Ubuntu 15.10 , when I start the jboss wildfly 9.0.2.Final and eclipse mars crashes due to JVM error. \nAt that time I cannot access Chrome or Firefox browsers as well.\nMost of the time I need to restart the Machine to fix it.

It also appears it's relying on functions that aren't 'common' anymore.\nThere may be patches online, however you are going to faces some headaches and such going forward.  I would reach out to VMware to see if they have a solution currently, as there's not much we can really do right now...\n\nA: VMPlayer 7 has a known issue with patches, as referred to in this answer, and VMPlayer 12, the current version, has a bug referred to in this answer.\nI would suggest that you download the current VMPlayer from vmware.com, and modify the wrapper file so that vmplayer will execute:\nOpen a terminal window ctrl+alt+t, and enter the following command\nsudo nano /usr/bin/vmplayer\n\nscroll down a few lines to a line which says set -e\nInput a new line:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/vmware/lib/libglibmm-2.4.so.1/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nPress ctrl+o and ctrl+x to save and exit, and you should be good to go.\n", "Q: Is there any software that blocks porn on all browsers that I can install? I have to find a way to block porn sites on all browsers through something system-wide like iptables (just an idea)... Is there any way that I can do that.\n\nA: There are several ways to do this\n\n\n*\n\n*Easiest, IMHO, is to use opendns\n\n\nOpendns has been asked here:\nHow to configure OpenDns\nOnce it is configured you configure it here - https://www.opendns.com/welcome/\nThe advantage is that blacklists are then maintained by opendns.\n\n\n*\n\n*The second method is to install and configure a proxy server . You can do this with dansguardian, privoxy, or squid to name a few. You then configure iptables to route all traffic through the proxy or proxy chain.\n\n\nhttp://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/web-content-filtering-made-easy/\nhttp://blog.bodhizazen.com/linux/how-to-transparent-proxy/\nThe disadvantage of this method is that you have to manually update and maintain the blacklist.\nhttp://www.squidguard.org/blacklists.html or subscribe to a service.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use iptables, but iptables is inefficient, and you again have to manually maintain a blacklist.\n\n*you can use a hosts file. You have to obtain and update the list yourself. \nhttp://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm\nThe above link is more for adblock.\nThe \"problem\" is that these sites tend to change ip and host names ;)\n\nA: There's no such thing as \"software that blocks porn\" -- artifical intelligence is nowhere near up to the job. All you can get is software that blocks websites that someone has blacklisted -- they may be diligently identifying and blocking porn websites, in which case they'll block some (but far from all) porn, or they may be blacklisting their competitors' websites or sites that they object to ideologically.\n\nA: Various software like Net Nanny, etc. can be used. Alternatives of Net Nanny for linux users may be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pluckeye: http://www.pluckeye.net/\n\n*e2guardian: http://e2guardian.org/\n\n*NxFilter :http://www.nxfilter.org/\n\nA: You can also use the service openDNS, which limits the name resolution based on the pre-set filters. Compared to the solution proposed for the /etc/hosts file it allows you to not have to constantly update the list.\nOnce you have set your own filters just use openDNS as name server.\nhttps://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/\n\nA: Every tool and way fights only with the sites existing at the time of creation of that tool, which are already quite many (sadly). No software or black list can predict what is going to appear. So every tool will be a temporary remedy. It is impossible to solve such problems with software. \nFind such a tool inside yourself and the people who use computer.\n\nA: Try adding an entry to the /etc/hosts file. Open up your terminal and type:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/hosts\n\nAdd a line for every site you want to block, e.g.\n127.0.0.1   www.example.com\n\nThen save the file. You may need to restart in order for the changes to take effect.\nNote: this will block access to the particular host from all software, not only the browsers.\n\nA: You can do this easily by editing the file /etc/hosts. Simply add lines for sites you wish to block by referring the site to an IP address of 0.0.0.0, like this:\n127.0.0.1   localhost\n127.0.1.1   mycomputer\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\n0.0.0.0 site.to.block.com\n0.0.0.0 another.site.net\n\n", "Q: How to configure ufw to allow xsane to reach scanner? I could not find any clear answer through prior research.  \nXsane fails to find the scanner with ufw enabled, works great with ufw off.\nI have opened 6566 for both tcp and udp in ufw.  Still no joy.  I could not tell from watching the \"listening report\" in ufw which ports sane is using other than 6566.\nIf the ports are not standard but vary by scanner (this is a Canon) advice on how to locate the required ports would be most welcome.\nEdit: I tried sudo ufw allow saned but I think this just opens port 6566 because the response back from the command was to the effect that it was already open.\nAdditional information: the port(s) that are being blocked seem to be related to scanner discovery and job status.  If I disable the firewall and start xsane, then turn on the firewall and scan, a scan will take place, but it repeats over and over (apparently a job completion status is not being sent).\nsudo netstat -lntp | grep saned showed port 6566 but no others.

However, this most recent one has to be the worst yet.\nUpon startup, my computer runs in low-graphics mode. Attempting to run in default settings kicks me to a tty. Viewing the xorg log tells me that lightdm is generating a broken xorg.conf, so the first thing I do is open a tty and type sudo nvidia-xconfig. Restarting lightdm just regenerates the broken config, so I don't bother with that.

I have a 1 GB USB stick I'd like to use to run Ubuntu with...\nThe total space is 961 MB - and all releases of Ubuntu/Kubuntu 15.10 and lower are 1.1 GB to 1.2 GB.\nAny ideas how can I fit a release onto the USB?\n\nA: You can choose Lubuntu or Xubuntu. But I am not sure if the final install will fit in 1 GB, so you could use Lubuntu minimal install OR xubuntu-core (I personally prefer xubuntu-core). To do this you have to download the mini.iso available in the Ubuntu website, here: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nThe mini.iso is a live system for text-based Ubuntu installation. It is around 40 MBs. You can burn it to a CD or USB and boot from it. Follow the instructions in the above link, choose your USB stick to be used as the root filesystem and a base for Ubuntu will be installed on it. Do not install any extra packages in the end of the minimal install.\nNow you have a headless (no graphical environment) Ubuntu system inside your USB stick. Boot from it and you will be dropped in a command line. From there you can run 'sudo apt-get install lubuntu-core' for a minimal version of Lubuntu or 'sudo apt-get install xubuntu-core^' (do not forget the ^) for a minimal version of Xubuntu. Lubuntu will leave you with more space for additional programs; in the other hand, Xubuntu has more features and customization, but you will be left with only a few MBs to use. The decision is yours.\nRemember: the \"core\" versions of Lubuntu/Xubuntu do not have any programs beyond the Desktop Environment, a File Manager, a Terminal and some configurations. You will have to install other programs (like web browsers, software centers and media players) from the command line.\nEDIT: seems like you would like to have Unity. You could try 'sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends ubuntu-desktop' on the command line to get only the Unity desktop environment, but I am not sure if it will fit in 1 GB. You could give it a try, and if there's no enough space, just format your USB stick and start again, using xubuntu-core or lubuntu-core. Please tell us your experience.\n\nA: Since the accepted answer by @Eduardo Cola was written, the engine under the hood as well as some of the application programs have grown.\n\n\n*\n\n*When this is written (2017-09-25) all current Lubuntu versions fit within 1 GB, when cloned from the iso file to a USB stick or memory card.\n\n*There is no currently supported version of Xubuntu still within 1 GB. Xubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, was supported for 3 years with end of life April 2017 and the current versions are too big.\n\n*It is not possible to create a useful installed Ubuntu based mini system within 1 GB. You can make a very bare-bone system from the Ubuntu mini.iso, but there will not be enough space for application programs. An installed Lubuntu system can be squeezed into 4 GB.\n\n*This link specifies the size needed for different cases,\nhelp.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Notes_about_size\n\n2 GB is enough for 'CD size' iso files as well as many but not all\n  'DVD size' iso files.\nIf you want a persistent live system with a decent size casper-rw\n  storage, you need at least 4 GB (2 GB is possible, but might soon run\n  out of space).\nIf you want an installed system you need at least 8 GB (4 GB is\n  possible with Lubuntu, but might soon run out of space). In the\n  beginning of 2017, it seems that there are no really fast pendrives\n  below 16 GB. If you want a fast system, install it into a pendrive\n  that performs well in a test, even if it is 'bigger than necessary'.\n\n\n*The reason why live Lubuntu is within 1 GB is that most of it is compressed, and expanded to RAM, when running a live session. This is not the case when installed, and more space is used. Last but not least, you need some drive space to store your own files.\n\nA: If you really must use Ubuntu, you can use an older version of it which is less than 1GB.\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04.5/\n", "Q: Tools to help filter out files (mostly images) I was recently on a trip and on my way back I lost lot of my pictures to a computer crash.

Type mount in a terminal, and see if the cryptodrive (although empty) is still mounted into this folder.

You should be able to remove the folder once it is not an active mountpoint anymore.\n", "Q: Alternatives media servers instead of Plex Media Server I am running a Plex Media Server and I have a major issue with it not seeing all my media. I also have a second server that uses Greyhole and I mounted that \"Drive\" that has some media on it to my Ubuntu server to stream that media on the more powerful server.\nFirst off, Plex can't play any of the videos or music on the Greyhole unit unless I use the Plex on it which is sluggish.  Also I have found that Plex on Samsung tv's has now started having connection issues out of the blue.\nIt used to work just fine, but as of roughly a couple weeks ago, it pauses and starts buffering. However my web player or PS3 or Roku have no issues.\nSo here is the question: What is the best media server for Ubuntu?  What alternatives do you use and what makes them better then Plex?\n\nA: Welcome to DIY software.  :)  Fortunately getting things like this right is one of the strengths of Ubuntu.\nBefore I offer up some of my opinions on the matter I'd just like ensure you've considered the following.\n1 - Plex can be considered sluggish, but I have only seen this when it's running on a low powered CPU.  This may in your case be to do with it running in a virtual machine, but I'd need more information on how much CPU and memory and what type of disk you run to be able to give you a solid answer on that.  (Try increasing the number of CPU cores available to the Virtual Guest and ensure it has 1-2GB Memory).\nBy nature, Plex is a streaming and transcoding service, this means lot's of CPU is needed unless you have every file pre-optimised into a format that your client can play in 'direct' mode.  This includes subtitles which invoke transcoding and definitely slow down slower Plex Servers.  In addition, clients like televisions may not support many codecs natively and you guessed it, this may also be forcing a transcode more than often.\n2 - Yes Samsung has somehow broken their Plex software in their store and there are quite a few comments about in on the web.  It has been that way for some time, so your best bet is to go to Samsung Support for that, or get a separate client (an easy to set up and cheap solution is the Raspberry Pi 2 - I have a guide for it here).  It works remarkably well.\n3 - With regards to Plex not 'seeing' things, the normal suspect is that linux file permissions are not set properly.  Have you tried chmod and chown on the media files you wish to include in the Plex Library?\nAlternatives\nAlternatives come down to what experience you really want and how much effort you want to spend to set it up.  Plex and Kodi are really the best media centres around.  Microsoft used to do one but it has now been discontinued.  That said, you can also set up a simple DLNA sever and buy dozens of DLNA chinese media players from your local PC store.  What these don't have however is nice menu systems like Plex and Kodi do.\nPlex is essentially the same as Kodi EXCEPT that Plex has a true client server architecture.  In fact the Plex clients were all based on Kodi / XBMC clients anyway.  If you have a simple disk with media on it, then go ahead and use Kodi.  If you want to display things in multiple rooms in the house, Kodi can do it with some MySQL tweaking, but actually Plex is the simplest and easiest.\nI have a guide on Plex for Windows on my site and one on installing Plex for Linux Headless here.  The linux headless guide should be your pick if you want a solution that is as far away from being sluggish as you could imagine.  Since you already know Ubuntu, I'd say this would be the way to go.\nLet me know if you want any help, I will respond to queries on that site.\nHope this helps you and Merry Christmas. :)\nMarshalleq\n", "Q: What is the key combination to move an application to a different workspace in Lubuntu? Is there a hot-key combination to move application between different workspaces in Lubuntu? I'm looking for a key combination similar to Ctlr-Alt-Shift  (Ubuntu). I tried modifying the ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml file but I could not get the right commands to switch applications. Any solutions?\n\nA: Setting the shortcut\nThe command\nTo move an application (-window) to another workspace from command, you need wmctrl to be installed. The command you need to move the frontmost application (-'s window) to a specific workspace (on Lubuntu) is:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t 1\n\nwhere 1 refers to the targeted workspace. The first workspace is 0, so the command above will move the active window to the second workspace.\nShortcuts in Lubuntu\nIn Lubuntu, to set custom shortcuts, (indeed) you have to manually edit the file ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml. \nThe easiest way to get the right syntax is to move to the keyboard section of the file, and simply copy an existing shortcut section, like the example below:\n   <!-- move window to workspace 2 on Ctrl + Alt + Y-->\n    <keybind key=\"C-A-Y\">\n      <action name=\"Execute\">\n        <command>wmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t 1</command>\n      </action>\n    </keybind>\n\nAs a test, I added the section, and it worked fine (after log out/in); it moved the active window to the corresponding workspace on the shortcut Control+Alt+Y. \nWhat you should keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*The command needs wmctrl to be installed:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n*It takes a log out/in to start working\n\n*The first workspace has index 0, so the command in the example actually moves the active window to the second workspace.\n\n\nA more detailed instruction on adding custom shortcut keys and the used syntax, see here, in the section further down; Create New Keyboard shortcuts Also here, you can find a.o. how to \"mention\" the keys in your shortcut section: \nKey combination\n\nKEY-COMBINATION is the key combination which you want to bind to the actions. The format for the KEY-COMBINATION is: Modifier-Modifier-Key. Any number of modifiers (0 or more) can be used together, and they are each separated by a \"-\". Multiple KEY-COMBINATION can be specified in one keybind by separating them with spaces. This is useful if you use multiple keybinds for a thing that is quite complicated to specify.\nModifiers\nModifier keys   \nS   Shift key\nC   Control key\nA   Alt key\nW   Super key (Usually bound to the Windows key on keyboards which have one)\nM   Meta key\nH   Hyper key (If it is bound to something)\n\nYou can also use Mod1 through Mod5 as the modifiers to directly select a modifier mask (e.g. Mod1 to select Mod1Mask), but this is for advanced users who have customized their modifier mapping with xmodmap. \n\nMore \"sophisticated\" options\nYou could create a script to see what is the current workspace, and move the active window to the next/previous one, instead of having to set a key combination for every (targeted) workspace.\nThat would however be another question :)\n\nA: On Lubuntu Lxqt 0.14.1:\nCtrl+Shift+Alt+Arrow (left or right)\n", "Q: How to disable Java in the browser for all users?

Many times I hear that software compiled at my hardware will work faster at my hardware. Can I win 10% of performance of Firefox or Chromium if compile from source?\n\nA: As a Gentoo user I can say for sure: it depends.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you disable some heavy options your application will work faster.\n\n*If you enable some risky optimizations and they work - your application will work faster. \n\n*If you use upstream defaults, your application will work slower. \n\n*If you misconfigure anything, application will be slow and unstable.\n\n\nGenerally, there is no noticable improvement that can be achieved by simple recompilation of the app. The only difference are heavy CPU-bound applications like video encoders. They perform slightly better with every new CPU technology and every new compiler. \n\nA: I have very basic knowledge and experience in compiling from source. But as far as I came to know, there are some advantages in compiling an app from its source.\nBasically, you can add or remove features from an app which is great if you need some specific features in it rather than installing whole of the app.\nTherefore, if you compile an app based on your need, you will get exactly what you need rather than whole of the app which can improve the performance.\nHave a look on these articles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiling vs pre-compiled packages\n\n*What is the difference between building from source and using an install package?\n\nSince this post was made 3 month ago, I would request you to share any possible answer to your question if you have come to.\nBests\n\nA: While you might get better performances by compiling a program from source and disabling/enabling particular options to tailor it to suit your needs, in this particular case you're talking about a web browser.  I'd say that the performance of web browsers heavily depend on the network connection speed and the bandwidth of the website you're visiting, and has little to do with an optimized compilation.  \nTherefore it's not worth the trouble.  \nYou might get much better performances by installing the binaries and then some specific browser plugin to e.g. block scripts or ads.\n", "Q: U1db-Qt not working as expected in ListView (Ubuntu Touch App Development) Recently, I've been trying to learn how to use the U1db Library (if that's what you call it), but it hasn't been working the way I expected it to work.\nHere is my code:\n import QtQuick 2.4\n import Ubuntu.Components 1.3\n import U1db 1.0 as U1db\n\n MainView {\n     objectName: \"mainView\"\n     applicationName: \"u1bdtest.evanlinjin\"\n\n     width: units.gu(100); height: units.gu(75);\n\n     U1db.Database {\n         id: aDatabase\n         path: \"aU1DbDatabase\"\n     }\n\n     U1db.Document {\n         id: aDocument\n         database: aDatabase\n         docId: 'helloWorld'\n         contents: {\"hello\": {\"world\": [{\"id\": 3, \"message\": \"Hello world.\"},\n                                        {\"id\": 3.33, \"message\": \"World, hello.\"},\n                                        {\"id\": 3.66, \"message\": \"HELLO WORLD!!!\"}\n                 ]}}\n     }\n\n     U1db.Index {\n         id: documentIndex\n         database: aDatabase\n         expression: [\"hello.world.id\", \"hello.world.message\"]\n     }\n\n     U1db.Query {\n         id: aQuery\n         index: documentIndex\n     }\n\n     Page {\n         title: i18n.tr(\"U1BdTest\")\n\n         Column {\n             spacing: units.gu(1)\n             anchors { margins: units.gu(2); fill: parent;}\n\n             Label {id: label; objectName: \"label\"; text: i18n.tr(\"A U1Bd Test.\");}\n\n             ListView {\n                 width: parent.width; height: parent.height; model: aQuery;\n                 delegate: Text {x: 66; text: \"(\" + index + \", \" + contents.id + \") \" + contents.message}\n             }\n         }\n     }\n }\n\nHere are the expected results in my \"ListView\":\n\n\n*\n\n*(0, 3) Hello world.\n\n*(1, 3.33) World, hello.\n\n*(2, 3.66) HELLO WORLD!!!\n\n\nHowever, only \"(0, 3) Hello world.\" is displayed.\nScreenshot\n\nA: Apparently it iterates over documents, not inside one document.\nIt took hello.world[0].id and hello.world[0].message from aDocument.

I don't have a specific bug report on hand to reference so I can't say for sure if the fix exists upstream but there is an easy way to find out if it is available. Install and boot to a more recent kernel and see if the SD card problem has improved. No harm will come to your computer and you can always remove it if you don't need it.\nRun apt-cache search linux-generic-ltsto see the other available kernel packages. The latest I see in the repository is linux-generic-lts-wily.

It has worked fine for ages, though I barely use it. I wanted to wipe all the data on it/return it to zeros, so I used\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb1\n\nBut it said 2GB was copied, and that didn't seem right. I went into gparted and created a new partition table (mdos) and then made a fat32 partition for the full usable 14gb. Gparted completed the operation, then said it couldn't find a filesystem. Plugging it in made a 16gb \"drive\" show up in nautilus, but right-click didn't give any properties info. Left-click caused a 2GB ejectable drive link to spawn in nautilus.\nObviously, I went all \"wtf?\" and went to ubuntu irc for answers.

Plugging it in popped up the same 16GB/2GB issue, with the same .txt test file I added to it. This, of course, made no sense. So, I rebooted the computer.\nB) Following reboot, the 2nd 16GB drive (never used dd on it, full of files) showed up like normal.\nC) Swapping it out with the 1st 16GB drive, I opened up GParted. In GParted I right-clicked the \"Unknown\" \"Can't find filesystem\" 14GB partition I'd created, and chose \"Format\" from the context menu.

On these machines, netstat also would show no processes listening on port 80, yet HTTP requests were somehow forwarded to Java server listening on port 3000. Hmmm.\n\nA: Nothing is listening on port 80 anymore. That iptables command just forwards requests to port 80 on an external network to port 3000 locally.\nBut the service is still only listening on port 3000, and nothing else is (apparently) listening on port 80, which is what is being reported by your system.\nMy guess is that you are testing this locally (i.e., with a browser on the same machine as the service). If this is the case, and localhost:3000 reaches the service, then the iptables rule is not being reached because the request is not coming on an external network (or some other iptables related reason -- I am assuming here that your rules are sound and working, but you should check this.)\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure that all traffic is going through this iptables rule, or create multiple rules so traffic from all sources for port 80 is redirected to 3000.\n\n*Change the service so it binds to port 80, and remove the iptables forwarding stuff.\n\n\nA: If you use authbind to start tomcats then we do not need iptables or any redirecting rules softwares or apache\nhope this link will be help full.\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/685306/377678\n", "Q: Bluetooth not working Lenovo G580 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I have problem with Bluetooth.

Since, for whatever reason (bug in Windows 10, bug in LPM for Win10, using incompatible(ie. made for Win7) LPM on Win10, you're unable to switch it on in Windows, you're being unable to use it in GNU/Linux as well.\nSource: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2239746&page=2\nThis wiered behaviour is not limited to Lenovo, here's what I found about a certain Dell laptop:\n\"For Dell laptops install the latest drivers from Dell's website in Windows in order for the bluetooth module to work in Linux.

Maybe you should try LPM for win7 on Win 10 if you're using LPM for win10 on Win 10 or vice versa.

Although you can enable nesting on your container, this may cause other user-space issues. To simply disable the kernel protections inside the container:\nsed -ie 's/^ProtectKernel/\\#ProtectKernel/g' /lib/systemd/system/logrotate.service\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n\n(3) If the above steps fail, some systems may need \"/var/log\" explicitly added to the service file:\necho \"ReadWritePaths=/var/log\" >> /lib/systemd/system/logrotate.service\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n\n(4) If the above steps fail, you may need to disable other system protections in /lib/systemd/system/logrotate.service, which may be any of the following:\nLockPersonality=true\nMemoryDenyWriteExecute=true\nPrivateDevices=true\nPrivateTmp=true\nProtectClock=true\nProtectControlGroups=true\nProtectHostname=true\nProtectKernelLogs=true\nProtectKernelModules=true\nProtectKernelTunables=true\nProtectSystem=full\nRestrictNamespaces=true\nRestrictRealtime=true\n\n\nEach of which may be set to \"true\", and the lines may be changed to \"false\" or commented-out.

I have a LAN with a few Ubuntu machines. My brother has a LAN with a few Linux machines.\nWe want to share some folders between each other, with full read/write access. How?\nThe special challenge is that we're not in the same house. We're not even in the same country! \nI'm guessing we need to set up some kind of private virtual network, so that the machines are essentially on the same LAN even though there are two ISP's in between. \nHow can we achieve this? What software/hardware do we even need?\nWe both have stable DSL lines. We both have Linux-only home LANs. Do we need some kind of SSL certificates? A domain name? I have no idea. I just know that NFS is way too complicated for my skill level.\nUpdate: Based on Bodhi's suggestion to use sshfs, I could immediately make that work between machines on my own LAN. So far so good! But: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can my brother access the machines in my home LAN, from his LAN? First of all, I'm guessing I need to arrange a DynDNS name for my home, because ISP-assigned IP addresses will change over time. But that won't help him address one specific machine on my LAN. How would he do that?\n\n*Is there a guide that explains what the steps are to \"Use ssh keys and disable password auth\"? I'm guessing I need to generate a set of private/public ssh keys and give him the public one? But then anyone with that key could access my machines? How does this work?\n\n\nWhen the above has been solved, I can just reverse our roles to access his machines the same way.\n\nA: Bastion/Jump host\nYou can configure one of your hosts on your LAN as a jump host or ssh bastion.  Your brother will ssh directly to this host, and from there he can ssh to the rest of your network from this machine.  He can also copy files into and out of your network with SCP to and from this host, then move them around as needed.\nA Good Bastion Host Article\nConnectivity options\n\n\n*\n\n*public IP - you can attach a public/floating IP address through your ISP to your router to allow connections in.  You can also set up a cloud instance somewhere with a floating IP address and use tis as your bastion host instead.  Maybe $30/month for an instance that you can use for other things too. It will probably be more expensive to get a public V4IP from your ISP.  Once this is set up you can use a VPN like openvpn (very cheap and reliable) from both sites to this host to essentially turn it onto a router between private networks.\nOpenVPN Site 2 Site\n\n*IPv6 - Depending on your ISP you may already be running dual stack, or IPv4 AND IPv6 at the same time.  While your IPv4 address is private and dynamic, your IPv6 address is likely associated with your account since the entire point of IPv6 was to address the fact that the world is out of IPv4 public addresses and allows everyone to have a unique address for every device.  Since you mentioned you are using DSL this is probably not available to you.  If you are running dual stack however, you already have a V6 unique address, and should be able to provide access with port forwarding via the address of your router as long as your ISP is allowing v6 through it's internet gateway back to your router.  This is an option, but you may find that this takes a huge amount of effort to get going, and may not even be possible.\nUbuntu IPv6 VPN Tutorial\n\n*Hamachi - (logmein.com) provides tools for doing things like this and doesnt cost much. his is definitely worth taking a look if you want to set it and forget it for a nominal fee.  They are essentially managing the aforementioned VPN setup for you and keeping it alive.  It works well if you dont mind paying for a solution, although there is some basic functionality that may work for you using their free components.\nHamachi Site 2 Site Tutorial\n\n*DynDNS - This is wizardry to me, but you are essentially bridging your gateway device to a static name from any point on the internet and allowing traffic through your gateway using a name and a route instead of a public IP address. You register this name with a 3rd party server/service to advertise the dynamic connection back to you since you are initiating a connection to this 3rd party endpoint and allowing traffic to be translated back in to your network.  Be careful with this type of setup as you are essentially opening up your LAN to the world and stand a good chance of being bothered over time by would be attackers.\nOpenSwan VPN Tutorial\nSecurity\nBe sure you are running some type of firewall between yourself and the world.  The firewall on your LAN machines shoudl be considered secondary to a firewall on your gateway and shoudl not be the only layer of security.  THis can be a machine acting as a firewall between your gateway and the rest of your LAN, or at the very least a list of disabled ports and protocols on your gateway device.\nUbuntu as a Gateway Router/Firewall Tutorial\n\nOne other thing I would note, if you are using DSL you can expect your connections to fail periodically.  DSL has ADHD and should drop on you once a day or so. Be sure to set up something via cron to \"kick\" your connection if it does down, or your brother will be calling you every time he needs access for you to reset your modem.\nHappy Hunting!\n\nA: This may not be exactly what you want. This will not directly connect your LANs. But focusing on \"We want to share some folders between each other, with full read/write access. How?\", this is a possible and easy way to do this:\nYou can use a Dropbox alternative without space limits, like Syncthing, Bittorrent Sync or AeroFS. All three are described here: Peer To Peer (P2P) Sync and Share Ubuntu\nIn short, they do all synchronize folders. I'm not sure whether in some of them it's possible to only sync a part of it. They all do not have space limits (except the ones of your hard drives). But you'll need to install it on all machines, or at least on one in your LAN and one in your brothers LAN. Within the LAN you can just use SMB sharing or whatever you like. Syncthing is also open source.\n\nA: Have you looked at Cloud services like box.net, Google's Drive, iCloud? All these provide some sort of document sharing with some collaboration support.\nThey all have some sort of work flow which makes them less natural than having the folders on a local file system. However, this work flow resolves the fundamental problem with share remote file systems: network delay. With any of the syncing services if you both decide to edit a document at the same time only one of you will get to keep your edits.\n", "Q: Cannot play Spotify and Youtube videos in Google Chrome concurrently in Ubuntu Wily 15.10 If I pause Spotify, I can play a Youtube video.

One of your sections (in the xorg.conf file) does not have an Identifier line.\nThe Section \"Monitor\" section has VendorName, ModelName, HorizSync and VertRefresh lines but no Identifier.\nAdd the following line directly after Section \"Monitor\" and before VendorName:\nIdentifier   \"Monitor0\" \nYour Section \"Screen\" references a Monitor \"Montior0\" (sic). Therefore it needs to find a Monitor with the Identifier \"Montior0\" (sic). It also highlights a possible typo there too.\nTherefore, change \"Montior0\" to \"Monitor0\" in the Section \"Screen\" and add the Identifier \"Monitor0\" line in the Section \"Monitor\". Hopefully that should do it.\nIn case you (or future readers of this post) don't know how: Edit the xorg.conf file with the following command:\nsudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nA: To expand on my comment into a more accessible answer, there are 2 steps to attempt to fix this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Move (Delete) ~/.config/monitors.xml\nStep 1: Since we cannot use a GUI (Graphical User Interface) we will have to boot into Grub.\nStep 2: Once in Grub, enable networking, then drop to shell prompt.\nStep 3: Once in Grub do mv ~/.config/monitors.xml ~/.config/old_monitors.xml\nStep 4: Move on to the second step we will need to do (Re-installing xorg)\n<>\n\n*Re-install Xorg\nPre-steps: Repeat steps 1 & 2 from above, to get to shell.\nStep 1: Do apt-get purge xauth\nStep 2: Do apt-get autoremove\nStep 3: Do apt-get install xauth\nStep 4: Do reboot now\nDone!

How can I run linux watch command?\n\nA: As seen, your PATH contains /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin, hence the watch you have installed by compiling locally (/usr/local/bin/watch) is having the precedence over original watch (/usr/bin/watch). Another very unlikely case is that /usr/bin is not in your PATH.\nYou have some solution options now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename the local watch (/usr/local/bin) as something else, given renaming won't create any problem\n\n*Edit your PATH to have /usr/bin before /usr/local/bin, again if would create no problem:\nPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:.....\n\n\n*Make an alias:\nalias watch=/usr/bin/watch\n\n\n*Use full path:\n/usr/bin/watch\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not load manager I installed a Ubuntu 15.10 and GNOME session.

However after upgrading to 15.10 on a fresh install, I am unable to set it up for XBMC. \nWhat I am supposed to do is use the cec-utils package for the cec-client command. However, this doesn't work.\n~$ cec-client\nNo device type given. Using 'recording device'\nlibcec.so.3.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\nCannot load libcec.so\n\nI've got both libcec3 and libcec-dev but neither work.\nAs you can see, I don't even get to the part to confirm whether my pulse-eight device is connected (which I have confirmed using lsusb) so I don't think it's due to that.\nDoes anyone have any idea on how I could solve it? I'm hoping that it's not just a matter of it not being supported yet.\n\nA: This can also be fixed by creating a symlink for the missing library:\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcec.so.3.0.1 /usr/local/lib/libcec.so.3.0\nsudo ldconfig\n\nIt worked for me on Ubuntu 15.10 x86_64.\n\nA: I managed to get it working. Rather than using the packages from the repositories, I tried compiling it myself.\nThis was one of the solutions I attempted before but I'm assuming now that I did something wrong. I'm guessing that I forgot to remove one of the packages and there was conflict or I missed out the last command here.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cmake liblockdev1-dev libudev-dev libxrandr-dev python-dev swig\ncd\ngit clone https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/platform.git\nmkdir platform/build\ncd platform/build\ncmake ..\nmake\nsudo make install\ncd\ngit clone https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec.git\nmkdir libcec/build\ncd libcec/build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4\nsudo make install\nsudo ldconfig\n\nIf this doesn't work for anyone else with the problem, check if they still have the libcec3 package installed.

I want eclipse to be available to all users on that development machine.\nThen I´ve build a symlink to call eclipse from anywhere using:\nsudo ln -s /opt/eclipse/eclipse /usr/bin/eclipse\n\nFrom my user console, when I type eclipse I´m getting the following error:\ncox@dev1:~/projects$ eclipse\n/root/.p2/poll/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.gtk.linux.x86_64_1.1.300.v20150602-1417: cannot open shared object file: Permission denied\nGtk-message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent.

But read point a)\n\nc) What are the correct steps to install both packages of Eclipse?\n\nThe Eclipse installer is a good choice. Read this for installation steps and this for doing it manually with two different Eclipse distributions.\n\nd) What is wrong with the installation?\n\nIf you did not upgrade the installer before installing and did not choose the expert mode of the installer and started the installer with sudo privileges the installer uses /root (if you do not change this explicit).\n\ne) Is there an apt-get install command to install Eclipse Mars 4.5 on Ubuntu 15.10 ?\n\nNo - the Mars release has no PPA and does not exist in a Ubuntu repository.\n\nf) How can I fix my installation to get Eclipse running ?\n\nMove the plugin folder from the root folder to the correct place in /opt/eclipse and correct the permissions. The folder and its content should be readable by all users. But before you do that, read the last part of the answer...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the symbolic link in /usr/bin, use different desktop files, see the linked answers below.\n\n*Remove the Eclipse installation in /opt.\n\n*Remove the /root/.p2 folder. Nothing of any Eclipse distribution should be found there. \n\n*Read this and this to become a feeling for the installation\n\n*Use the expert mode in the Eclipse installer.\n\n*Use different workspaces for PHP, C++, ... after the first start of the different Eclipse distribution.\n\n*If it does not work perfectly remove everything and restart. It is important that the installation works perfectly to avoid problems when using Eclipse later.\n", "Q: Shrew Soft VPN fail to attach key daemon I'm trying to use Shrew Soft to connect to my school VPN. But as you can see here, it says \n\nfailed to connect to key daemon\n\nI searched for the solution and people who use Shrew Soft Trace Utility and easily solved this on Windows OS as seen here.\nYet, I don't know how to solve this on Ubuntu 14.04.\nAlso, is there a substitute application for Shrew Soft VPN for Ubuntu?\nThanks!\n\nA: I had the same problem. I found out that iked service was not running. I solved it by opening a terminal emulator and issued the command:\nsudo /var/tmp/ike/script/linux/iked start\n\nI later found out that the Shrew installation on Ubuntu does not add this script to start up at all (shame on the guys and girls from Shrew ;-)). To do this yourself do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal issue the command:\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\n\n*Type your root password and add the following line just before the last line (which normally says exit 0)\n/var/tmp/ike/script/linux/iked start\n\n\n*Save and close it.\nNext time you restart your computer the service will be active and the error should never bother you again. \n\nA: You can always check it if it's running by using the following command:\npgrep iked \nif you get a result, it means the process is running\nif not run the below command:\nsudo /usr/sbin/iked\nit starts service \n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04, enable iked on startup by creating a systemd unit file:\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/shrewvpn.service\n\nwith the contents:\n[Unit]\nAfter = network-online.target\nWants = network-online.target\n\n[Service]\nType = oneshot\nRemainAfterExit = yes\nExecStart = /usr/sbin/iked\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy = multi-user.target\n\nEnable your service on startup by issuing:\nsystemctl enable shrewvpn\n\nand start it in the current session using:\nsystemctl start shrewvpn\n\n\nA: Look in services.msc, I'm assuming that one of the Shrewsoft services isn't running. Should have two or 2 of them(shrewsoft IKE Daemon, Shrewsoft IPSEC Daemon, and Shrewsoft DNS Daemon). You may not have the last one.\n", "Q: Wifi dosn't work after waking up.

Any help is appreciated.\n\nA: According to ARCH, this problem is caused by openjdk. Please, remove it by typing:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge openjdk*\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nAlso, after that if you need java for your daily programming, then I suggest installing Oracle Java. Follow the tutorial here at webupd8.\nADDED: As pointed out by BrunoNova, the issue doesn't occur with openjdk 8. And here's the link to the bug pointed out by him.\n", "Q: Open source FortiGate (Forti SSL VPN) client support in Ubuntu Does anyone work on adding support for opensource FortiGate SSL VPN NetworkManager client to Ubuntu?\nAccording to this blog https://blogs.gnome.org/lkundrak/2015/09/24/fortigate-ssl-vpn-support-added-to-networkmanager/ there is initial support for open source FortiGate client.\n(Frontend: network-manager-fortisslvpn, Backend: openfortivpn )\nIf there is no one, how can I help?\nI am a software developer however having no experiences Ubuntu packaging rules/contribution policies. Any constructive guidance welcome.\n\nA: Since Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic), you can connect with the regular network manager by simply installing the package network-manager-fortisslvpn-gnome. Find it in Software or do\nsudo apt install network-manager-fortisslvpn-gnome\n\n(This will also install dependencies openfortivpn and network-manager-fortisslvpn.)\nThen you can click Edit connections in network manager (right click the wifi icon), + to add a new one, select type Fortinet SSLVPN under the VPN heading. Give it a name, then under Gateway put in the IP address (and optionally port separated by colon, e.g. 11.22.33.44:44443) and username/password. Note that you may have to click the little symbol in the password field to select who has access to the password before you're allowed to type anything in that text field.\nSave and right-click the wifi icon again, click VPN and pick the name you chose.\n\nIf it doesn't work, that may be because you need to trust a certificate. If you have the certificate fingerprint, you can edit your connection and add it under Advanced→Trusted certificate. If you don't know your certificate, https://serverfault.com/a/922767/104546 explains how to find it from the terminal.\n", "Q: How can i get glibc source code ？ i have download one source code (glibc，linuxthreads） form GNU site .and install it in /usr/local.\nI want to compiler glibc and change some code ，but i don't know where can download the source code.\nquestion:\n\n\n*\n\n*is other program  need？ \n\n*how can i install it？\n\n\nA: Start here: https://launchpad.net/glibc\nYou will find packages and versions for various releases and architectures of Ubuntu.

When I install an updated kernel - as part of regular updates - it takes a lot longer than any other update. (I'm talking about a few minutes - not a really long time.) There are no error messages. I'm talking about successful, routine updates.\nI have noticed this for years. It doesn't matter which specific kernel it is.\nI have a fast connection. The time to download it isn't long and I'm not counting it. I'm also not counting the time to reboot after the kernel is installed.\nI'd just like to know what its doing that takes so long.\nIt also takes pretty long to uninstall an old kernel version although it's a little faster than installing a new one.\nPart of it is probably because it has to run grub update a couple of times, which is time consuming. From some messages I've seen, it looks like this always runs twice. I don't know why.\nWhat does a kernel update actually do?\n(I know what kernels are and what they do. I'm asking specifically about the update process itself.)\n\nA: This is hard to say with out specifics, but in general:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update initfs (the in memory file system used to start the system before all the modules are loaded) This can take a while. \n\n*Rebuild all DKMS modules, many \"third party\" modules like video card drivers or Virtual Box modules are distributed as a DKMS package. They get recompiled at every kernel version. Virtual Box's host OS drivers can take a very long time depending how \"in use\" they are.\n\n*Update Grub - This can take a while, or not, depending on setup. \n\n*Restart services, though not strictly needed for a kernal update, updating DKMS packages, can require the re-starting of services in some cases. VMWare (I think) for example\n\n*Building the system map. \n\n*Updating the Dependency tree\n\n\nSome of these steps can be very fast or very long. For example, rebuilding DKMS packages on a VMWare Server can take hours if you have to wait for the service to shutdown cleanly, while updating DKMS packages on a system with no DKMS modules takes very little time (just enough to check that there are no modules). \n", "Q: How to troubleshoot random freezes, when alt+sysrq doesn't work? How do I troubleshoot random freezes, where the system does not accept any input?\nI have a computer that used to run Ubuntu a few years back without any problems (I don't know wether any hardware has changed). Recently, no matter which Linux distribution I install, it will randomly freeze to a point where the cursor is frozen and it doesn't respond to any keyboard input, including alt+sysrq (when the system isn't frozen I can alt+sysrq REISUB and it will reboot). There are no answers in What should I do when Ubuntu freezes? that appear to 'work' in this situation.\nI've triggered the freeze with the following systems: Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 14.10, Ubuntu 15.04, Ubuntu 15.10, as well as Fedora 22 and 23 (all 64 bit versions). \nIt happens with XFCE, Unity and even Gnome, it happens with nouveau and different versions of the proprietary nvidia driver. \nIt can freeze even as early as during the installation, or during a live session. Sometimes the system will run for 5 minutes before freezing and sometimes two hours. \nThe same hardware can run a Windows operating system for days without issues.\nI have tried setting up Kernel Crash Dump, but it doesn't seem to trigger when the system freezes. There are no entries in syslog or kern.log that appear to have been written just before the freeze. On some freezes, the last entry in syslog or kern.log was 30 minutes earlier.\nUpdate:\nI have disconnected a wireless network card as well as a USB webcam, will let the machine run over night to see if one of those is causing it. Will update with results.\nUpdate 2:\nIt froze again. I'm literally out of ideas. Any suggestions are welcome.\nUpdate3: \nSome hardware specs that might be relevant:\nMotherboard: Sabertooth 990FX R2.0\nCPU: AMD FX-8350 Black Edition\nGPU: GeForce GTX 660\nUpdate3:\nI have recently upgraded the bios of the Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 to Version 2501 (the latest version currently available), without any luck.\nUpdate 4:\nI've ran a memtest for 9 hours, several passes and not a single error. There are two DIMMS seated in slot 2 and 4 on the motherboard. I have now tried removing the one from slot 4, and will see if I can reproduce the freeze. Will swap them around afterwards.\nUpdate 5:\nIt has run for many hours without freezing so far, I'm finding it hard to believe myself. It might be solved, but I don't understand why. I guess I'll try and give it a few days to be sure.\nUpdate 6:\nThere have been no freezes, and I must conclude that they were caused by faulty memory. Since the memtest didn't show any errors, chances are I would've never figured out what was wrong had I not started disconnecting 'random' parts. Is this the best approach really? If someone can write up a more systematic way to go at something like this, perhaps with troubleshooting from within Ubuntu, I will award them the bounty.\n\nA: Here is what works for me . \nWhenever Ubuntu freezes and no keyboard or mouse input works for me I launch a fullscreen login terminal ( I don't know the proper name) by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nAfter the terminal  is launched I again press Ctrl+Alt+F7. And it brings me back to my original GUI Ubuntu working environment.\nAnd Ubuntu unfreezes.\n Additional Info \nAfter launching that terminal you can logout or restart or do whatever you want to do in a traditional terminal.\nYou can use any of the buttons F1 to F6 using the combination above to launch the terminals. And can launch the GUI environment using F7 as described above.\n", "Q: I cannot connect to mobile broadband network I'm using Ubuntu gnome 14.04.3.

Just this morning I installed Ubuntu (alongside windows) and I immediately noticed that my cursor is flickering. I searched through askubuntu.com and I found that I needed to either disable the \"Unknown display\" (Not appearing in my case) or one of the two I currently have. The problem is that I need both of my displays. So, is there anything else I can do to fix this? \nThank you in advance\n\nA: At the blinking cursor, just hit ALT + CTRL + F1, and lo and behold, you will get a login prompt. From there you will be able to build a working xorg and get xbmc up and running.\nElse,\nTry holding down the shift key while booting the machine. Keep holding it down until you get the Grub menu - hopefully. You'll want to edit the first entry. The next to last line usually, that starts with linux /boot/vmlinuz-blah blah blah, and probably ends with quiet splash. what ever the line ends with, insert a space followed by nomodeset\nthen boot the machine, read instructions at bottom of that page.\nGood Luck, hopefully holding down shift key will get you into the grub menu.\nthe nomodeset option is used for Nvidia graphics, other graphics need variations on the nomodeset switch.

I consider buying an Asus Zenbook UX305FA but it is hard to find any reliable information regarding usability of the QHD+ display. Does it make sense with Ubuntu? All information, I found is rather vague or outdated. Can anybody report experiences with that machine / display and Ubuntu?\nHardware: Asus Zenbook UX305FA\nUbuntu: 14.04         \n\nA: I have a Dell XPS13 9343 with a QHD display (3200x1800) and use Ubuntu Gnome.\nMost applications run well, but Firefox struggles to keep the resolution consistent. I use an add-on AutoHiDPI which helps, but if the window is resized or moved, it resets. So I keep the add-ons tab open so that I can disable/re-enable the addon to correct it.\nA few older applications have strange half-height edit boxes, but again, resizing windows often sorts them out.\nIf you use Remmina for RDP access, there is currently no ability to scale the remote display, so for me, accessing a Windows server via Remmina gives a minute window.\nCurrent Linux versions will only handle HiDPI settings across all monitors, so if you plug in an ordinary external monitor, it is assumed to be HiDPI and so windows are massive. When Wayland is finally released, this will be resolved as it enables each monitor to have its own HiDPI settings.\nIn summary, today things on HiDPI displays are OK in general, with a few older apps that can be a challenge, but things will improve as time moves on, especially as more & more devices use hi-res monitors.\n\nA: I can confirm that Ubuntu works well with the display of UX305FA (see also 1). The computer has the integrated Intel graphics which is using the package xserver-xorg-video-intel which is rather buggy. It causes much complications in many programs and applications. However, its substitute modesetting package has its pros and cons too. Etc flickering screen with videos and interactive websites like Google Plus in the former. I purged the former so I use instead the latter package which works better for me (since hate epileptic views) but has its complications, for instance with Matlab (font rendering; ...). As a summary\n\n\n*\n\n*no complete keybindings in Ubuntu with the modesetting package; etc no no brightness control with the keys F5/F6 but can be done. \n\n*xserver-xorg-video-intel - possible flickering of the screen with interactive media but solutions for other UI bugs etc F5/F6 for brightness adjustments exist. \n\n\nConclusion: Zenbook is more robust than Macbook for Ubuntu; QHD+ resolution works great, also with an external display; graphic drivers can be a source of pain (Intel and NVidia) but the development team is working with the modesetting package for the coming releases (not sure when); however, no possibility to update firmwares on the Ubuntu side; most Zenbooks are designed nowadays for Windows 10 so you may want to keep Windows 10 as dual-boot on your system. \nRelated: Review of Ubuntu on Asus UX305FA\nHardwares tested: UX305FA, UX303UA\nUbuntu: 16.04   \n", "Q: Security risk in everyday use of an admin account (not root)? The only thing that distinguishes my admin account from normal accounts is that my admin account is a member of the sudo group and can run sudo.  Is it any less secure to use my admin account for daily work?  If yes, why?\nAssume that I am very careful where I enter my password and know what a command does before executing it, of course. \nIf I used a normal non-admin account for my daily account, when I needed to run something as root I would su into my admin account (not into root, as that has no password and is disabled!) and there run the sudo command in the admin shell; or, I would switch users graphically. Thus, the amount of commands that would be run is the same -- using a normal account would just mean that I have to enter my admin password twice when running something as root.\nSo, should advanced users do everyday work on a normal account instead of an admin account?  And why or why not?\nPlease note that by \"admin account\" I mean an account with privilege to use sudo to run commands as root - not the root account itself.  I never log in as root.\n\nA: No risk while not root\nFrom my understanding for an administrator, or sudo user it is working just like a normal desktop user as long as we don't say sudo - so there should be no additional risk.\nRisk of accidentally becoming root\nIt is also true that a user having potentially admininistrator permissions needs to watch out at bit closer where, when, or whom they give away their password.\nI can imagine (though I never met one) an evil application or a script asking you for your password without telling you what for. It likely will perform something with root permissions, as it would not need your password otherwise. If I don't know what this application does I would simply not give it my root password.\nWe are also responsible to dismiss root permission again after we are finished. It always is a bad idea to stay root while working with a graphical application such as e.g. Nautilus.\nRisk of losing root access\nAnother \"risk\" may be that you do something bad with your account that prevents you from logging in. Therefore I always create at least two administrator users on any box I install Ubuntu to. This is for the case something breaks my main account.\n\nA: Yes, there are risks. Whether or not those risks are big enough for you to care about is a matter of preference and/or your security policy.\nAny time you use a computer, you are always at risk from attackers. Even if you run an extremely secure setup, you cannot protect against as-yet unknown vulnerabilities.\nIf you are using an account without sudo privileges and that account is compromised due to that use (e.g. a keylogger grabs your password), then that adds a limitation on the damage that can be done. If an attacker compromises an account with sudo privileges then they gain those privileges too.\nOn most systems, using sudo will cause your password to be remembered for 15 minutes by default, which is another risk factor, unless you change that setting.\n\nA: An account that can sudo is technically as able as the root account (assuming a default sudoers configuration behaviour) but there is still quite a big difference between root and an account that can sudo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Accidentally omitting a single character won't destroy Ubuntu. Probably. Consider trying to delete ~/bin but actually running rm against /bin. If you aren't root, there's less risk.\n\n*sudo requires a password, giving you those milliseconds to work out any mistakes. It also means that other applications don't have the ability to do rooty things on your behalf.\nThis is why we recommend people not use the root account for everyday work.\n\nInsulating yourself with another intermediary \"admin\" account (and running as a user without sudo access) is just another layer. It should also probably be a different password.\nIt's extra fuss though and (per your question conditions) if something can sniff out your first password, they can probably get the second just as easily. If you never ever made mistakes, and never use these strong passwords anywhere else (not guessable or crackable), this solution is probably no more secure. If somebody wants root they'll boot into recovery, chroot, or use a wrench.\n\nThere is also a school of thought that points out that [for non-enterprise desktop users] nothing you value is protected from your user. All your documents, photos, web browsing history, etc is owned and accessible by you or something running as you. Just as you can run something that logs all your keystrokes, views your webcam, listens on your microphone, etc.\nSimply put, malware doesn't need root to ruin somebody's life, or to spy on you.\n\nA: I run exactly like that:  One user where I do my user stuff and one user where I do only admin stuff an no user stuff.  Even the command prompts are different: users have a green prompt and admins a red one!\nWhy?\nThe user had its own settings for all of the applications that I use separate from the admin user, which allows you to:\n\n*\n\n*Debug whether an issue is user-related or system related\n\n*Have the admin account as a backup user account instead of the guest account and root account if anything goes really wrong with your user settings and you cannot log on any more.\n\n*keep admin docs and user docs separated in their respective home directories if you choose to do so.\n\n*No effect when typing an accidental sudo before a command.\n\n*No way to actually see what a normal user is not supposed to see.\n\n*No way of hitting a user privilege escalation bug. (there have been a few in the past)\n\n*Be a \"normal user\" just like all the other users on your computer and know what the advantages/disadvantages are.\n\n\nA: My opinion-based answer, because everything would have to be proven mathematically, and from that I have no idea. ;)\nTwo accounts one with groups adm and sudo, means one account have the right to execute commands with sudo rights. One without this privileges.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have cracked the password for the non-privileged account, then you still have to crack the password for the privileged account now. -> Advantage in comparison with only one account\n\n*If you have cracked the privileged account. -> No advantage in comparison with only one account\n\n\nThe probability is 50% if you do not respect the intelligence of the attacker.\nFrom my perspective, it's theoretical a very little security benefit and belongs more to the realm of probability theory. But the loss of convenience increases disproportionately. It depends on how smart the attacker is. Do not underestimate this intelligence. That's a false sense of security.\nIn other words, no, it brings you no measurable benefit, but you lose a lot of convenience. At the end everyone must decide for themselves.\n", "Q: How to backup data of first computer to the hard drive of second? I have two computers connected to same network.

If you've got localhost in your connection setup for PgAdmin it'll use TCP/IP instead, which is probably set to require md5 password authentication.

I've seen like 5 - 10 pages on how to install Ubuntu when Windows 8 and up is the original one. The latest one I followed is This guide on instructables, which I found the easiest to follow.\nI have an Acer Aspire V3-772G which had Windows 8 when I bought it, now I have Windows 10 from the free upgrade. I love the way Linux work, so I want to install Ubuntu, because the one I feel I know best and I know it would fit me, because I'm a coder which love low level stuff.\nI've successfully installed Ubuntu 14.04.3, But when I boot the computer I can't manage to get into GRUB, I just get into my Windows 10. I have UEFI, and I can't disable Secure Boot.\nI've tried moving Windows Boot Manager to the bottom, I thought it would help but it didn't. I've also disabled Fast Boot, still not working. The only way I can get into Ubuntu is by Pressing F12 multiple times when booting, to get into the BIOS boot selection menu, choose the Ubuntu drive and get into grub that way.\nWhat I want though is a way to boot directly into grub, and choose windows or ubuntu that way. I've also tried this command:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nwhich I saw on this thread. Still didn't work. I did make sure to install a 64-bit Ubuntu because I do have a 64-bit laptop. And I also followed the (I may have said the name wrong) \"how to get a UEFI bootable USB\" (I use an USB because I have no CD/DVD available). So, I don't wanna give up, I would be very happy if I could get this working.\n\nA: First, you probably can disable Secure Boot; you just haven't figured out how. For systems that shipped with Windows 8, Microsoft required that users be able to disable Secure Boot, so if it really can't be done, Acer is in violation of their contract with Microsoft. That said, the option could be completely hidden or named in a confusing way. That said, disabling Secure Boot should not be necessary -- it does work for you, or you wouldn't have been able to boot the installer. There is one exception, though....\nIn the bcdedit command you said you used, specifying grubx64.efi bypasses Shim, which is what Ubuntu uses to deal with Secure Boot. Thus, that particular command will work only if Secure Boot is disabled. The equivalent that should work with Secure Boot active is:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nYou can also try using EasyUEFI in Windows. This is a third-party GUI tool for managing EFI boot manager entries. Try moving the working ubuntu entry to the top of the priority list.\nIf that doesn't work, then chances are your firmware is defective. I'd say to return the computer to the store for a refund, but if you've had it for beyond the return period, you may be out of luck on that score. There is an ugly hack of a workaround, as described here (among other places). At a minimum, if you need to resort to this \"solution,\" you should write to the manufacturer. If possible, return the computer for a refund because it's defective.\n\nA: I've had fought with this issue a couple of times, in my case, I can disable secureboot from BIOS, it can be frustrated but when you understand how it works it will be a piece of cake.\nHow you can try to make it work, use a live cd/usb to enter ubuntu interface and there you can choose two ways to repair the boot loader:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've used to use Boot Repair easy: install click on \"repair\" button and follow the steps.\n\n*The other way to do it, and as my view, better: terminal way\nHope it helps :)\n\nA: To achieve what you want first disable hibernation and Fast Boot in Windows.\nTo disable hibernation open command prompt as administrator and execute :  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nTo disable Fast Boot open Control Panel (the old version - not the modern design),\nselect the Energy Settings, enable show hidden settings and uncheck Fast Boot.  \nAfter completion - shutdown the machine completely - do NOT reboot !\nNow select Ubuntu in BIOS / UEFI settings to be the default OS to boot.  \nStart the computer - when GRUB appears you're done - if not - next step :\nReinstall the GRUB boot loader to your Ubuntu installation  in EFI mode.\nBoot from the Ubuntu installation media - open a terminal and execute:  \n    sudo mount /dev/sd*** /mnt\n    sudo mount /dev/sd** /mnt/boot/efi\n    for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n    sudo chroot /mnt\n    grub-install /dev/sd*\n    update-grub  \n\nNote:  \nsd* = disk | sd** = efi partition | sd*** = system partition  \nTo identify the partition numbers use GParted - it is included in the Ubuntu installation media.\nBoot into BIOS and select Ubuntu in UEFI settings to be the default operating system to boot.\n\nA: Since you haven't got the secure boot option, maybe you can enable legacy support in the BIOS? That setting prevented my computer from booting into grub.\nGood luck!\n\nA: This worked for me.\nSearch for Command Prompt, right click on it to run it as administrator.\nThen run:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nIf the \"booting failed\" error comes up, just disable Safe Booting from the BIOS menu.\nBack as normal.\n", "Q: how to remove previously unselected package youtube-dl Reading package lists...

Following this answer:\nsudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\nThen assign new shortcut:\n\n*\n\n*Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts > +\nAdd those two:\n\n*\n\n*Brightness up: xbacklight -inc 10\n\n*Brightness down: xbacklight -dec 10\nThen click on each of the Disabled and select the new shortcut. In my case I used Alt+F5 and Alt+F6 (since I use Ctrl+F5 for web dev).\nIf you want, you can also mess with the boot options to fix it:\n\nHi,\nI have the same problem. there is a workaround although.\nadd \"acpi_osi=\" at the and of the kernel boot parameters.\nto permanently do this edit /etc/default/grub as root and add \"acpi_osi=\" at the end of GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT then run \"update-grub\" as root\nafter that brightness and all other hotkeys work but the ambient light sensor is no longer detected. But this is not a big problem since there is no standard ambient light regulation of screen brightness anyway\n\n\nA: If you are interested by auto brightness for this notebook (through ALS sensor) it can help to you:\nhttps://github.com/Perlover/Asus-Zenbook-Ambient-Light-Sensor-Controller/tree/asus-ux305\nIt works at my Asus UX305 ;-)\nBut you need to blacklist acpi_als module before\n", "Q: UbuntuGNOME 15.10 64 bit doesn't shut down My laptop doesn't entirely shut down. Everything goes black but the screen is still on and I have to force shutdown.\nI don't know to which package should I post this bug to. How can I determine this ?\nMy laptop is an Acer TimeLine X 5820T, 8GB RAM, 240 Kingston SSD, Intel Graphics version and Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 64 bit.\n\nA: Add a specification to your grub commandline option in the /etc/default/grub config file.  This is the option that begins with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.\nTry adding the following reboot=pci to that line.  The changes would be:\nChange from:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nChange to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=pci\"\n\nAfter making changes to your grub configuration you will have to run the update command to activate the change:\n$ sudo update-grub\n\n(The $ sign is important in the line above.  It's indicating a terminal commandline from the user's prompt.)\nThere are other reboot flags you can test if that one fails.  The options includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*warm - don’t set the cold reboot flag\n\n*cold - set the cold reboot flag\n\n*bios - reboot by jumping through the BIOS (only for X86_32)\n\n*smp (reboot by executing reset on BSP or other CPU - only for X86_32)\n\n*triple - force a triple fault - init\n\n*kbd - use the keyboard controller. cold reset (default)\n\n*acpi - use the RESET_REG in the FADT\n\n*efi - use efi reset_system runtime service\n\n*pci - use the so-called “PCI reset register”, CF9\n\n*force - avoid anything that could hang\n\n\nAlso, you can try multiple parameters at the same time such as:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=warm,cold,bios,smp,triple,kbd,acpi,efi,pci,force\"\n\nOther details can be found at:\nhttp://michalorman.com/2013/10/fix-ubuntu-freeze-during-restart\n\nA: It can be caused by some program which refuses to close while shutting down or after installing updates (happened with me). It can also be after changing your login screen (happened with me after installing lxdm). Before shutting down try to manually force close user apps using task manager. Also try updating your grub using\nsudo update-grub\n\nUsually it happens only after installing updates and should be resolved at next boot.\n\nA: I have the same problem on every Linux OS! Actually there is nothing wrong with your OS, it's a bug in your kernel. The latest kernel now doesn't let the laptop shutdown, so it's better not to upgrade your kernel. I have already reported this bug. \nSo to fix the problem those who already upgraded to the newest kernel version have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downgrade your kernel version.\n\n*Upgrade the kernel again when the bug has been fixed.\n\n\nIn my opinion it's better for stability to run a Linux system that is 2 or 3 kernel versions behind.\n", "Q: I cannot install python-numpy I have Ubuntu 14.04 and I cannot install numpy.\nhere is my attempt:\nohad@ohad-Vostro-3300:~$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy\n[sudo] password for ohad: \nReading package lists...

I suggest, from a terminal:\nsudo -i\necho \"blacklist b43\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\necho \"blacklist bcma\"  >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\necho wl  >>  /etc/modules\nexit\n\nReboot and you should be all set. \n", "Q: Update of latest kernel I'm quite new to Ubuntu;\nI read the following on this page:\n\nHow to update kernel to the latest mainline version without any Distro-upgrade?\n\"The latest kernel version any user is supposed to use in Ubuntu is updated automatically via the Update Manager, so no action is normally required by user regarding kernel upgrades.\"\n\nBy \"updated automatically\" and \"no action is required\" does this mean that the kernel installs itself in the background without me knowing (sounds more like something that Windows would do, not Linux) or is it supposed to appear in the Update Manager, then I click on \"Install now\" to install it?\nCurrently my Update manager tells me there's a new kernel to be installed, \"Complete generic Linux kernel and headers\" and \"Ubuntu base\" totaling 66MB.\nIf that's normal then I shall install them.\nThanks.\n\nA: Comparing with mainline kernels, you don't need to pick a kernel version or manually download the deb files. That part is handled by Ubuntu. The only action left is installing the upgrades - for which, usually you have to manually allow the Update Manager to install updates. I'd modify that to \"extra action\" - nothing more than you'd need for any other package.\nYou can turn on unattended upgrades, then the kernel should be updated for security upgrades without asking you, but that's neither here nor there.\n", "Q: gnome control center: system settings -> details -> graphics. string from command line Using 12.04 LTS for example:\nWhere is the string pulled from that the gnome control center displays for: \n\n\n*\n\n*System Settings -> Details -> Overview (for the Graphics string)\nor \n\n*System Settings -> Details -> Graphics (for the Driver string)\n\n\nI would like to pull it up in a command line, but more importantly I am curious where this information is reported from.\n\nUpdate:\nAnyhow, I am aware of the glxinfo string. I am trying to troubleshoot AMD unsupported hardware logo for a system that once did have the same 13.1 legacy driver installed on 12.04. The result for glxinfo is: OpenGL renderer string: ATI Radeon HD 3650 AGP yet the driver information displayed by the control center is: simply: VESA. Clearly the control center is pulling a string for a different case than what glxinfo uses. I will look more closely at the function to see what those cases are. The reason I want to know this is to get a better understanding of the various driver stacks and how information is being pulled from them.\n\nA: The information is provided by the driver via OpenGL (see the function being called). If you want, you can use the glxinfo command (from mesa-utils):\n$ glxinfo | grep renderer\nOpenGL renderer string: GeForce GTX 670MX/PCIe/SSE2\n\n\n", "Q: QT interfaces broken I ran into a strange issue a couple of days ago and i have no idea what to do. Some of my programs interfaces seem to be broken recently. It is rather odd because i haven't done any major updates. It seems to me (although i'm no expert) that all the QT interfaces are broken (ie VLC, Clementine, Skype). It is really bothering me because i cannot use a lot of programs. However the majority of programs and the system itself are running just fine.\nThe interfaces appear somehow incomplete with all the components having wrong dimensions, texts not appearing and flickering on user interactions. I really have no idea where to start and what can possibly cause an issue like that as it was working fine for years.\nI am running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. \nRunning some of the programs from command line i get a gtk-warning Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed: error 28. This seems to be because of something with shared memory segments. This is really strange to me as i am kind of using my system the same way i always did. A search on this error brought quite some confusing information. However i couldn't find a solution or any information that was helpful for me.\nFor skype i have tried the solution & workaround from here without sucess: How to fix graphical issues with Skype, Gdk-WARNING?\nEDIT:\nI found out the applications work fine when i have a fresh restart. They just stop working at some point... So the Gdk-WARNING concerning shared memory seems to be the problem. Although i cannot seem to free any of the memory by closing all my running applications. So probably the solution would be to find the application that is cluttering the shared memory space?\n\nA: I had the same problem. You're right, the reason is there is no free shared memory in the system.\nTo find out, who's taking all shared memory, you can run ipcs -m -p. In my case the output was something like:\n$ ipcs -m -p\n\n------ Shared Memory Creator/Last-op PIDs --------\nshmid      owner      cpid       lpid      \n1277952    weekens    3642       3746      \n2523137    weekens    4046       4119      \n1409026    weekens    3696       3343      \n786435     weekens    3203       1310      \n1802244    weekens    3887       3919      \n1900549    weekens    3899       3343      \n1998854    weekens    3906       3343      \n2031623    weekens    3872       498       \n2326536    weekens    3885       17493     \n2228233    weekens    3885       17493     \n2261002    weekens    3885       17493     \n2424843    weekens    3872       498       \n2555916    weekens    3885       17493     \n136708109  weekens    3872       498       \n2719758    weekens    4176       3343      \n2752527    weekens    4176       3343      \n2850832    weekens    4573       18066     \n2949137    weekens    4155       788       \n2981906    weekens    4155       788       \n3112979    weekens    4916       4916      \n3145748    weekens    4916       4916      \n3178517    weekens    4916       4916      \n3211286    weekens    4916       4916      \n3244055    weekens    4916       4916      \n3276824    weekens    4916       4916      \n3309593    weekens    4916       4916      \n3342362    weekens    4916       4916      \n3375131    weekens    4916       4916      \n3407900    weekens    4916       4916      \n3440669    weekens    4916       4916      \n3473438    weekens    4916       4916      \n3506207    weekens    4916       4916      \n3538976    weekens    4916       4916      \n3571745    weekens    4916       4916      \n3604514    weekens    4916       4916      \n3637283    weekens    4916       4916      \n3670052    weekens    4916       4916      \n3702821    weekens    4916       4916      \n3735590    weekens    4916       4916      \n3768359    weekens    4916       4916      \n3801128    weekens    4916       4916      \n3833897    weekens    4916       4916      \n3866666    weekens    4916       4916      \n3899435    weekens    4916       4916      \n3932204    weekens    4916       4916      \n3964973    weekens    4916       4916      \n3997742    weekens    4916       4916      \n4030511    weekens    4916       4916      \n4063280    weekens    4916       4916      \n4096049    weekens    4916       4916      \n4128818    weekens    4916       4916      \n4161587    weekens    4916       4916      \n4194356    weekens    4916       4916      \n4227125    weekens    4916       4916      \n4259894    weekens    4916       4916      \n4292663    weekens    4916       4916      \n4325432    weekens    4916       4916      \n4358201    weekens    4916       4916      \n4390970    weekens    4916       4916\n.... 4916 PID all the way down\n\n, so the process with PID 4916 turned out to consume all the shared memory (it was IntelliJ IDEA).

I find Synaptic a rather convenient tool for browsing through the repositories looking what's in them but I prefer to use command line to install the actual packages (to let bash maintain history of what I have installed manually) and it annoys me that I can't use apt-get when Synaptic is running. I would also like to be able to use a nice GUI to browse remote repositories without attaching them. Does anybody happen to know a tool I might like?\n\nA: Synaptic asks for root because the Synaptic .desktop file launches synaptic-pkexec:\n$ grep Exec /usr/share/applications/synaptic.desktop \nExec=synaptic-pkexec\n\nRunning just synaptic will avoid the root requirement, preventing Synaptic from locking the databases, or making any changes.\nYou can create your own .desktop file which will invoke just synaptic, running it as a normal user:\ncp /usr/share/applications/synaptic.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\nchmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/synaptic.desktop\nsed -i 's/-pkexec//;/^Name/s/$/ (non root)/' ~/.local/share/applications/synaptic.desktop\n\nI don't know of any browser for an unconnected repository.\n", "Q: lightdm won't start after bumblebee install On an Asus rog with GT960M graphic card running Lubuntu 15.10, \nI installed bumblebee (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee) which rebooted fine.

For example:\nwget ftp://ftp.pangeia.com.br/pub/seg/pac/chkrootkit.tar.gz\ntar -xvzf chkrootkit.tar.gz\n\"cd\" into the directory this creates and follow the instructions in the README.  This will rule out the possibility of a rootkit altering your sources list and pulling in something you dont want.\nIdeally you would have detection software in place BEFORE someone installs a rootkit, but you can work around it in most cases.  Bear in mind that any rootkit that is hiding in your kernel increases the size of the kernel.  The more complicated the rootkit is, the larger the kernel will be.  you can check the specs of recent kernels frm the source at kernel.org. If your kernel is taking up more resources than it should you may have a rootkit, but in 15 years of enterprise IT work in media, scientific, government, and telecommunicaitons industries I have only seen a rootkit deployed once, and it was on the T.V. show Mr. Robot.\nUltimately the best thing to do is wipe the machine and start over if you have a legitimate reason to suspect tampering.\n", "Q: low resolution VGA monitors (640x480 or 480p) in Ubuntu I want to do some emulation on an external display. I have a Sony PGM2950Q monitor. This monitor is only capable of displaying 480p (640 x 480) at 31Hz. So it should be great for Mame.\nPlugging it in to my Thinkpad T-61 (intel graphics) with Ubuntu 14.04.3 with VGA (via BNC breakout cable) results in a garbled / overlapping display running at the lowest setting of 800x600 @ 60Hz. I know the monitor works as have tested it previously.\nWhat would be the best way to fix this? Ideally I want it to recognise a configured display rather than have to set it up every time.\n\nA: You can use xrandr:\nThe commands to be executed in order:\ncvt 640 480\nxrandr --newmode \"640x480_31.00\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThe part of the line after xrandr --newmode is similar to the ouput you should get when using the cvt command, so copy the output from the \"resolution_refreshRate\" (\"640x480_31.00\" here) point to the +vsync point and add it to xrandr --newmode.\nThen:\nxrandr --addmode LVDS1 resolution_refreshRate (don't use speechmarks)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode resolution_refreshRate\n\nIf you want to make the changes permanent:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bash script, xrandr.sh for example, and place your xrandr commands into it: #!/bin/bash\nsudo xrandr --newmode \"\"640x480_31.00\"\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nsudo xrandr --addmode LVDS1 640x480_31.00\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 640x480_31.00\n\n*Make the script executable with chmod +x xrandr.sh\n\n*Search for \"Startup Applications\" in the dash, run it, and add the script as a startup application.\nThe commands will now run every time you log into your account.\nNote: I'm using LVDS1 as the supposed monitor name, but yours probably won't be the same.

( maybe due to being\n  optimized differently ? )\n  \n\nDepends on how they rely on 4.6.3. Does your build process invoke gcc or gcc-4.6? If the latter, there shouldn't be any changes. If the former, you should use the alternatives system to configure gcc to use gcc-4.6, or change your processes to use gcc-4.6/g++-4.6. (Lookup update-alternatives.)\n\n\n  \n*Most importantly, Can several versions of the compilers be installed on a system without breaking previous versions of them ?\n  \n\nYes, if you're installing using reasonably built debian packages.

I'm about to switch from windows to ubuntu but I'm pondering if I should do a whole format when installing ubuntu or keep windows on the side.\nI'm saving some files that I care about on an external hard drive but I'm anxious I might miss some of those.

I'm wondering if making an install \"next to\" windows is not as clean as doing a full formatting ? In other words, ubuntu will be installed in another partition (I guess) then the windows partition will be deleted, will ubuntu then take the whole hard drive for itself ? Will there be any residual garbage from windows ?\n\n\nIf it's indeed cleaner to remove everything and install ubuntu I'll take the risk of missing some files.\n\nA: Some pointers:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you use a dual boot you can keep track of how many times you still use  Windows. \n\n*If you keep files on an NTFS formatted place you probably want to keep a workable version of Windows. When partitions have errors on NTFS it mosttimes is better to use Windows to fix it. Easy way out: when you have Ubuntu you can take the files out of there, format to EXT and move them back.\n\n*If you have the space to spare you can shrink Windows to a bare minimum it will boot with and set Grub to boot straight into Ubuntu. You never going to see the option to boot Windows but it is still there.\n\n\nMind though: it is also possible to use Ubuntu and install Windows inside of Ubuntu (with VM-Ware, Virtual Box).\n\nI'm wondering if making an install \"next to\" windows is not as clean as doing a full formatting ? \n\nYou can always remove Windows from inside Ubuntu and re-install grub so it ends up at the beginning of your disk.\n\nIn other words, ubuntu will be installed in another partition (I guess) then the windows partition will be deleted, will ubuntu then take the whole hard drive for itself ? \n\nThat depends on what you choose during install. If you have Windows + unallocated space you can create a dual boot by installing Ubuntu into the unallocated space. If you do not have unallocated space you can only remove Windows. That will remove -ALL- partitions (so in Windows terms: it will also delete D:, E:). \n\nA: Well, if you want to keep Windows, do a dual-boot. If you do not want Windows anymore I would recommend you to format the full disk to make the Ubuntu Installation. If you keep Windows, Install Ubuntu and THEN remove Windows, Ubuntu will not take up the whole disk, and you have to consider that a system in the first partition of a disk is always faster.\n", "Q: How to customize windows frames(panels) I want to learn to customize GTK themes.

The \"UnityDecoration\" style properties are what you're looking for in the CSS.\nFor a full description of what all the different properties and files do, see the Ubuntu Wiki's page on Unity theming.\n", "Q: WiFi icon not displaying plus some WiFi networks never connecting on Ubuntu Studio 14.04 Been using Ubuntu since March 2013 and now I installed Ubuntu Studio 14.04 on notebook.\nWiFi icon won't show, and while notebook connects to most of WiFi networks, it won't connect to some (not even asking for password for those) and in other cases it will connect only to go down after a while.\nSome driver information follows:\n$ lsmod | grep 8192  \namdkfd                 81920  1  \nsnd_hda_codec_realtek    81920  1  \nrtl8192se              65536  0  \nrtl_pci                28672  1 rtl8192se  \nrtlwifi                73728  2 rtl_pci,rtl8192se  \nmac80211              724992  3 rtl_pci,rtlwifi,rtl8192se  \nr8169                  81920  0  \n\n\nA: Install a driver this way\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rtlwifi-new-dkms linux-firmware\n\n", "Q: How to find out on which port mongo is? I know that default mongo port is 27017 and I can connect to this instance on such port.\nBut I tried to figure it out by other means.\nI found that mongo is running by ps aux | grep mongo with it I can see /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf\nAt /etc/mongod.conf port is 27018\nNetstat netstat -tulnp | grep 2701 gives me\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:27017           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -               \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:27018           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -\n\nI don't know why I don't see name of the process. Is there any other way to be sure that mongo works on 27017?\n\nA: lsof -i | grep mongo\n\nThis will list all open files (lsof) that are listening on \"Internet addresses\" (-i).  The output of this is piped to grep, which is used to filter by text.  In this case, we're looking for all files open, related to the Internet, that match the word mongo.\n\nA: Actually you can use:\nlsof -i -ac mongod\n\nlsof can do more than just look up network connections. the \"-a\" is for \"And\" so it will have to match both criteria. Otherwise it defaults to \"Or\". The \"-c\" is for the command. You can also specify user name or PID or lots of other stuff. \n\nA: You could use nmap to scan ports in range from 1 to 65535 with -p- flag\nFor instance, \nDownloads:$ nmap -p- localhost\n\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-11-10 12:07 MST\nNmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)\nHost is up (0.00036s latency).\nNot shown: 65529 closed ports\nPORT      STATE SERVICE\n21/tcp    open  ftp\n22/tcp    open  ssh\n25/tcp    open  smtp\n631/tcp   open  ipp\n37818/tcp open  unknown\n46400/tcp open  unknown\n\n\nA: From the system shell you can use lsof or netstat -an as you mentioned to view what a process is doing in terms of open ports.  As an alternative you can run the db.getCmdLineOpts() command from the mongo shell.  That output will give you all the arguments passed on the command line (argv) to the server and the ones from the config file (parsed) and you can infer the ports mongod is listening based on that information.  Here's an example:\n{\n        \"argv\" : [\n               \"/usr/bin/mongod\",\n               \"--config\",\n               \"/etc/mongod.conf\",\n               \"--fork\"\n        ],\n        \"parsed\" : {\n               \"bind_ip\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n               \"config\" : \"/etc/mongodb/mongodb.conf\",\n               \"dbpath\" : \"/srv/mongodb\",\n               \"fork\" : true,\n               \"logappend\" : \"true\",\n               \"logpath\" : \"/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log\",\n               \"quiet\" : \"true\",\n               \"port\" : 30001\n        },\n        \"ok\" : 1\n}\n\nIf you have not passed specific port options like the one above, then the mongod will be listening on 27017 (normal) and 28017 (http status interface) by default.  \nNote: there are a couple of other arguments that can alter ports without being explicit, see here:\nhttps://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole\nI mention this because your lsof output also shows port 27018 open, which is the default if you have the shardsvr option set.  Hence, your output suggests that you may have a mongos on 27017 and a (shard) mongod on 27018.  If you connect to each and run the getCmdLineOpts() you should be able to figure out how things are configured.\n", "Q: How to disable Intel i915 video module?

There is a folder which is being created within another folder in my home directory, and I want to be able to analyse the contents of this folder, however, I have a problem: as the folder is created, it is then immediately deleted by the same program that creates it. Is there any way that I can allow it to create the folder, but then not to delete it? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: There are no permission settings that can do this, even using ACLs, but you can have a race with the program, using inotifywait:\nIn one terminal, I ran:\nwhile sleep 0.5; do if mkdir foo/bar; then echo foo; rmdir foo/bar; fi; done\n\nAs you can see, this creates a directory, echoes a message and removes the directory - all of which happens very quickly by human standards.\nAnd in another:\nwhile true\ndo\n    if inotifywait -e create foo\n    then\n        chmod -w foo\n        if [[ -d foo/bar ]]\n        then\n            break \n        else\n            chmod +w foo\n        fi\n    fi\ndone\n\nThis command waits for creation of anything in foo, then removes write permissions from foo, and tests if it was in time for catching the sub directory. If not, it adds back the write permission, and starts again.\nAfter waiting a bit:\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nfoo\nrmdir: failed to remove ‘foo/bar’: Permission denied\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘foo/bar’: File exists\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘foo/bar’: File exists\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘foo/bar’: File exists\nmkdir: cannot create directory ‘foo/bar’: File exists\n\nThis is relying on a race condition, so whether you can catch it is a matter of luck.\n\nfoo/bar is the directory that the program makes. If you don't know the name of it, you can try other ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*ensure that there's nothing else in the directory, so when a subdirectory is created, foo/ is non-empty. Some tests for non-empty directory are available in this U&L post:\nshopt -s nullglob\nif [ -n \"$(ls -A foo/)\" ]\nthen\n    break\n\nThis worked fast enough.\n\n*read the name of the created directory from inotifywait's output:\nif dir=$(inotifywait -e create --format '%f' foo)\nthen\n    chmod -w foo\n    if [[ -d foo/$dir ]]\n\nThis didn't work (yet) for me; the overhead of creating subshell seems to make it just sufficiently slow enough for the other loop to win each time. Maybe coded in C using the inotify API, this could work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu installer can't find any disk on Dell XPS 13 9350 I am trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 / 15.10 on my Dell XPS 13 9350 (November 2015).\nI created a bootable USB disk which boots fine but the installer and the file manager do not detect the hard drive.\nWhat is the problem?

Those are absolutely not needed, you already have two kernels installed. One is the latest one, and the other is the one from which you upgraded (now, regarded as recovery kernel). The third is the one which was used as a recovery kernel before the upgrade. Use this command to remove the oldest kernel of the three, i.e, 4.2.0.16:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nEDIT: Ubuntu flavour is not the concern. The concept is applicable for all.\n\nA: If it is not the current kernel that you are using you may remove it using sudo apt-get autoremove.\nYou can find the current kernel version using the following command:\nuname -a\n\nI generally keep at least 2-3 kernels on my machine in case I have to boot into another one if something goes wrong.\n", "Q: Main partition and Mounting point I've discovered that the Linux \"runable\" partition of my desktop PC has only 255 MB and it is mounted at /boot.\nThis is absolutely different to my laptop PC HDD configuration.\nI can't change it.

How can I put it into another point, and with more big space?\nThanks a lot for your help!\nGreetings & Blessings from Chile!\nJuan\n\nA: /boot partition is your partition with kernels and grub loader. Actually no needs to increase it, just clean old kernels from time to time. https://askubuntu.com/a/254585/217142\nPS. You can increase it but from Live CD or like that.\n", "Q: How to hibernate PC at certain time via Terminal?

I can find all the files I want using find however I want to use mv to move them all to a certain folder. How can I do that?\n\nA: A slight skew, cp and mv both support a -t target argument that lets you start with where your destination and end your command with a long list of things to copy or move. That lends itself perfectly to things like find -exec ... {} +, which will build a long command efficiently. Much more than find -exec ... {} \\;\nfind . -type f -exec mv -t /new/path {} +\n\n\nA: Classic approach - find + while loop\n find /your/top/directory -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | while IFS=\"\" read -r -d \"\" FILENAME; do mv -t /path/to/destination/directory  \"$FILENAME\";done\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*find gives you the list of files ( indicated by -type to ignore directories ) in /your/top/directory , descends at maximum 1 level in the directory structure, and prints the output as null-separated string;\n\n*while loop in conjunction with read take each part of that null-separated string and store it to FILENAME variable.\n\n*mv throws the current file to destination directory indicated with -t flag.\n\n\nThis approach is very useful when you want to avoid parsing ls output, and in fact, I've learned it here.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS dual boot with Windows 10, Windows 10 not showing in GRUB i am new to Ubuntu and hope someone is able to help, I'l give you as much information as possible:\nI was running windows 10 on an ssd with a seperate 1 TB drive for data and wanted to try Ubuntu. Using windows disk manager I created a free partition on my ssd, I then tried to install Ubuntu (14.04.3 LTS 64 bit) onto the partition. However the installer did not recognize I had any operating system so gave me no \"install alongside\" option, thus i selected the \"do something different\" option. I selected my available partition and set it up as a primary partition with ext4 file system and proceeded to seemingly successfully install Ubuntu onto it. Upon restarting however my PC would boot up strait to windows without GRUB appearing at all. \nAfter doing some research online I tried running the boot-repair wizard with Ubuntu live from a flash drive. I went through the recommended repair and eventual it told me everything should be OK and gave me this report:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/13219064\nNow when i boot up GRUB appears but only gives me the options: Ubuntu, advanced options for Ubuntu & System setup. When running Ubuntu i can see my drive with all the windows files still inside it.

It is important that they exit with a non-zero status if there is an error, so that the package management system can stop its processing. For shell scripts this means that you almost alwaysneed to use set -e (this is usually true when writing shell scripts, in fact). It is also important, of course, that they exit with a zero status if everything went well.\n\nFinally, remove the package again\nsudo apt-get purge bitdefender-scanner\nsudo apt-get autoremove bitdefender-scanner\n\n", "Q: Lazarus fpc.cfg is missing I installed Lazarus with this tutorial http://wiki.freepascal.org/Installing_Lazarus\nBut when i open Lazarus i get the error:\nfpc.cfg missing.\nI used the alien command to install Lazaris and this is what i think the mistake(Because the site said: Debian users are recommended to use the deb packages, but may use either alien (warning, it doesn't generate fpc.cfg) or the tarball install.)\nHow can i create a fpc.cnf file or fix this error?\n\nA: I suggest you to use DEB packages anyway. There are DEB files to download directly on official sites. You need to install FPC, FPC-SRC, and Lazarus packages. fpc.cfg is autogenerated in /etc.\nThere is also command from FPC to generate fpc.cfg: fpcmkcfg.\n\nA: Its already stated there as to how to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal: Ctrl + Alt + T.\n\n*Type the following:\nTHEPREFIX/lib/fpc/3.0.0/samplecfg $THEPREFIX/lib/fpc/3.0.0 $ETCDIR\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Optionally test to see if ppc386 -i (or whatever compiler your architecture uses) gives output, else give a warning that user need to add $PREFIX/bin to his current path.

I've just noticed that my home folder only shows as having 1.7 TB of space. Running lsdisk I get the below result. Am I right in thinking the hard drives have been partitioned? And how can I go about getting back to one 3 TB storage volume in Raid 1? I'm new to Linux so any help would be much appreciated.\n\n\nA: Your /home partition is assigned a 1.7TB partition on the 2.7TB drive, with a / partition having 1024GB, and an 8GB swap partition, and a 512MB /boot partition.  This is why you have a 1.7TB /home partition.\nIf you want to change the partitioning layout, talk to the Dedicated Server host, since you're renting it from them they have physical access to change the partitioning layout.\nNote that them changing the partitioning layout may mean data loss.  We can't really help you fix something on their systems, when they're the ones that did the partitioning and you don't have the ability to boot into a method to mess with partitioning.\n", "Q: NetBeans 8.1 IDE Installer won't let me click on Next button (Ubuntu 15.10) I have downloaded the installer for NetBeans 8.1 IDE.

Their meaning is not related to the working directory of a process (like shell) but to the directory the entry is in.\n.. provides two-way linking of the directory tree structure while . is a convenient name for referring to the directory itself. The path directory/. is the same as directory. Theoretically an empty string could have been chosen to refer to the directory itself but in fact it is not like that: ls '' does not work and the meaning of an empty string would be ambiguous because at the beginning of the a path it refers to the root directory already: Would /file1 mean file1 in the root directory or file1 in the current working directory?\nAs thomasrutter showed it is important that as normal directory entries you can use . and .. in a path. For example ./-filename could be used to avoid interpreting of the dash character - as an introduction of command line options. The path directory1/../directory2 in effect is the same as ./directory2 which is the same as directory2.\nWhy are . and .. hidden?\nFile (and directory) names with . at the beginning are by convention hidden in Unix-like systems so by default most of tools will not show the . and .. directories. This is useful because we already know the . and .. are normally present in every directory.\nThe command ls -a shows all the directory entries. In Nautilus Ctrl+H turns displaying of the hidden entries on but with exception of . and .. because they are normally not very useful in a graphical file manager. For similar behaviour on the command line you can use ls -A.\nAre . and .. real directory entries?\nYes, in the commonly used file system they are. (as Jonathan Leffler reminded) How can we check that?\n# prepare the directory\ncd /tmp ; mkdir testdir1\n\n# test 1\nls -lid testdir1 testdir1/. testdir1/..\n1179767 drwxrwxr-x  2 pabouk  pabouk  4096 Nov 12 11:52 testdir1\n1179767 drwxrwxr-x  2 pabouk  pabouk  4096 Nov 12 11:52 testdir1/.\n1179650 drwxrwxrwt 14 root    root    4096 Nov 12 15:17 testdir1/..\n\nThe inode number (1st column) referring to the data structure of the directory/file itself is the same for the same directory testdir1 and testdir1/.. The link count (3rd column) showing the number of the directory entries referring to the inode (directory/file) is 2 right after creating the directory because there is testdir1 in /tmp and . in /tmp/testdir1. The inode of /tmp/testdir1/.. (/tmp) has 14 links because it has 12 subdirectories containing .. + the 2 entries as every directory.\n# test 2\ntouch testdir1/tesfile1   # to have a regular file too\n\ndebugfs /dev/sda2 -R 'ls -l /tmp/testdir1' | cat\ndebugfs 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)\n 1179767   40775 (2)   1000   1000    4096 12-Nov-2015 11:52 .\n 1179650   41777 (2)      0      0    4096 12-Nov-2015 15:46 ..\n 1179771  100664 (1)   1000   1000       0 12-Nov-2015 11:52 tesfile1\n\nThe utility debugfs reads the ext2 (and newer) file system data directly from the disk sectors (bypassing the file system in the Linux kernel).\n# test 3\n\ndebugfs /dev/sda2 -R 'dump /tmp/testdir1 '>(od -tax1)\ndebugfs 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)\n0000000   w nul dc2 nul  ff nul soh stx   . nul nul nul stx nul dc2 nul\n         77  00  12  00  0c  00  01  02  2e  00  00  00  02  00  12  00\n0000020  ff nul stx stx   .   . nul nul   { nul dc2 nul   h  si  bs soh\n         0c  00  02  02  2e  2e  00  00  7b  00  12  00  e8  0f  08  01\n0000040   t   e   s   f   i   l   e   1   s   o   c   k   e   t nul nul\n         74  65  73  66  69  6c  65  31  73  6f  63  6b  65  74  00  00\n0000060 nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul nul\n         00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00\n*\n0010000\n\nIf you do not believe the directory listing of debugfs you can examine the raw dump of the directory and check that the . and .. entries are really there.\n\nA: Short answer: . refers to your current directory, .. refers to directory above it, aka parent directory. /media is for mounting stuff like USB and partitions on your drive. Unless you explicitly attached an USB or mounted something there yourself , that directory will remain empty.\n\nA: . is the current directory and .. is the parent directory.\nTake the following directory hierarchy as an example:\nfoo\n└── bar\n\nfoo/. and foo/bar/.. are foo.\n\nA: If Nautilus shows nothing and ls -a only shows . and .., then there is nothing in that directory.\nDirectory . represents the current directory, it is a way to reference files and directories using a relative path. E.g. ./subdir1/subdir2/somefile\nWhen you give the command ls, under the hood this is translated into ls .\nThe same is true for .., it is a way to reference the parent directory. E.g. ../../etc/cron.d.\n\nA: These two entries are integral to the file systems on your machine, and are present in the list returned by the kernel's low-level directory listing functions.\nAs others have said, .. is a link to the parent directory, and . is a link to the current directory.\nSome front-ends such as nautilus hide these two entries, because they aren't really as relevant in a graphical environment, but they are still there.\nWhy do they exist?\nThese are shortcuts for convenience.  They're implemented across your entire file system to ensure that no matter which application you're using, they'll work - they don't depend on individual application support.  They'll work anywhere that a directory path is allowed, including config files.\n\n*\n\n*The .. shortcut allows you to refer to the parent of a directory with directory/.., its grandparent using directory/../.. and so on.\n\n\n*The . shortcut allows you to explicitly refer to the current directory, in cases where an application requires you to specify a directory (or directories) to search in and you want to search in the current directory.\nFor example, . can be added to the PATH environment variable, allowing the current directory to be searched for matching executables by default.  Or, if it doesn't exist in PATH, you can use ./myscript to run a script in the current directory, even though the PATH environment variable would not otherwise look in the current directory for an executable.\nHow they're implemented\nIn most traditional file systems the . and .. entries are implemented on-disk as directory entries which share an inode with the directories they point to - that is, they are like hard links to the current and parent directory, except that they cannot be deleted or modified.\nWith the help of the operating system kernel, the .. entry even works across mounts points, ensuring that the root of a mount point will have a .. entry implemented as a link to the parent directory where the mount resides.  This happens regardless of filesystem types - it would happen even in virtual filesystems like /proc.\n. and .. are reserved filenames - it is not possible to create an actual file or directory and give it . or .. as a name (although you can start a filename with these characters).\n", "Q: How can I get avahi-autoipd to get an address on an alias, regardless of the state of the interface? I want to configure an address on eth0:ipv4ll, even if eth0 is itself configured. Eth0 will never be configured with an ipv4ll address, it's set to DHCP. The system in question is used both in a regular network, and out of it, and needs to ipv4ll address all the time.\nI set up a line in the interfaces file as such:\niface eth0:ipv4ll inet ipv4ll\n\nBut, this merely gets a log note that avahi-auotipd isn't configuring the interface because it already has a routable address on it.\nYes, eth0 has an address. But eth0:ipv4ll isn't eth0.\nI can't figure out where exactly avahi-autoipd is being run, or I'd simply add --force-binding to the line.\nIs there a better way?\n\nA: I looked at the ifupdown source and definition file and the ipv4ll interface type is just a manual up/down wrapper.  You can configure an avahi-autoipd interface in /etc/network/interfaces as a manual type:\nauto eth0:0\niface eth0:0 inet manual\n  up avahi-autoipd -D --force-bind eth0:0\n  down avahi-autoipd -k eth0:0\n\nIf you have eth0 configured for dhcp then you also need to comment out the line in /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/avahi-autoipd that causes the avahi interface to be killed off when dhcp configures itself.  Once you do these things then you will be able to use an eth0 and eth0:0 (which gets renamed to eth0:avahi after you ifup eth0:0, oddly).\n\nA: Well, it seems that ifup calls avahi-autoipd directly, from a static string inside the binary.\nKind of inflexible.\nI'll be pursuing another solution. I'd welcome advice in any case. For instance, I wonder if there is a better choice than ifupdown, which also seem s to know too much about Network Manager.\n", "Q: Problems with the internet I switched over to ubuntu 14.04.3 the other day after my windows got corrupted. now im just lost. the laptop connects to the internet just fine at my house, however, i fixed up the laptop for a friend to use and the internet just wont work at his house. it says it's connected to his wifi, but nothing will load. i tried pinging google.com and got 0 responses. we tried to play a game while we had it connected to my wifi, but the ping was rediculously high, any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: It could be a DNS server issue.

You can also control whether it locks the screen using the +lock option.  So to set it for a 5 minute break every 25 minutes locking you out, you should run it like this\nxwrits typetime=25 breaktime=5 +lock &\n\n\nA: You may also want to consider Workrave. I found it easy to use and highly customizable. It also has some preatty nice stats about how you use the computer and how many breaks you take. Lastly, I believe it can also sync itself between many computers, which is useful if, for example, you work both on the laptop and on a school computer.\n\nEDIT: It has many other features that I haven't mentioned, like suggesting some exercises for you to do while the screen is blocked. And it can take into account only the time you're using the computer, so it won't prompt you with a break when you come back from the toilet :)\nEDIT 2:\nMake sure you check out the \"Reading\" mode!\nThe above feature of only counting the time you've been actively using the computer can be seen as a bug if you're not doing much (no mouse, no keyboard events) because it will only prompt your break when you cumulate 1h of usage (or how much time you've set up). In these situations, enabling the \"Reading\" mode will make it prompt at the exact time, regardless of usage.\n\nA: Crude, minimalist, command-line way:\nsleep 1500; gnome-screensaver-command -l; sleep 300; killall gnome-screensaver\n\nThat can also be turned into a desktop shortcut or turned into function in .bashrc\nWhy 1500 and 300? because that's seconds, 1500 seconds /60 seconds per minute = 25 minutes.\n\nBelow is a script for a timer that allows setting variable session and break time, as well as methods of signalling the break. \nRemember that any script on linux must be saved as a file and have executable permissions set with chmod +x /path/to/script.sh.

I want to keep on typing with a dark screen, i.e. I want to be able to switch it on again only by pressing one specific key combination.

I can already adjust the brightness to be quite dark with another keyboard combination, but in the darkest setting /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/actual_brightness contains already 0 whereas the screen illumination is still brighter than off. So the switch I think about might be adressed by the Fn+F6 mechanism somewhere else than in the /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 tree.

Now i want to make it work on Ubuntu 14.04 with python 3. Can i make python application totally independent of python-2?\nPlease share your views / ideas.\nAppreciate your help!!\nThanks,\nMrudula  \n\nA: Can you? Sure.\nConsider for a moment that Python 2 is going to be supported into 2020 officially and possibly longer unofficially. Do you need to port this to Python 3? You could be lazy and let 2020's mrudula figure this one out.\nI'm sure you're aware that Python 2 and 3 aren't directly compatible. You probably have to make a few changes to port between them. There are tools like 2to3 (included in Ubuntu) that make this much easier —at least more automated— but there are likely still libraries you're using that rely on Python 2.x that you'll need to replace.\nOr you can stick with Python 2.7.\nEither which way, I've been through the same process as you're doing now with several small Django apps. The biggest single improvement I can suggest (if you aren't already doing it) is to move to a virtualenv (the venv module in Py3k). Keeping things separated from the system has allowed a lot of pulled hair to grow back.\nI'd suggest the following itinerary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 14.04 on another machine (VM, whatever)\n\n*Create a Python 2 virtualenv for your app and activate it.\nsudo apt-get install python-virtualenv\n/usr/bin/virtualenv venv\nsource ./venv/bin/activate\npip install -U pip\n\n\n*Install any requirements you know you need with pip. If you've activated a virtualenv, it will install them locally, no sudo required.\n\n*Get things working. This is an iterative process of running it until it realises you're missing something.\n\n*When you are certain you know it all works and you have all your requirements, dump them (and version constraints) in a file called requirements.txt\nIf you're happy with Python 2, you can stop there. Migrate that onto a real server (if it isn't on one already) and commit your requirements.txt to version control so you can restore your environment really quickly in the future if you need to.\nIf you want to continue to Python 3, the path is much clearer:\n\n\n*Delete your Python 2 virtualenv, create a Python 3 venv and install your requirements:\ndeactivate\n/usr/bin/python3 -mvenv venv\npip install -U pip\npip install -Ur requirements\n\n\n*Unleash 2to3 (and other tools) on your source and finish the port manually. Make sure you have a backup of what you have already. It's not a vastly complicated tool (see 2to3 --help) but typically speaking, this should be enough to get you going (remember to backup first, this will write changes):\n2to3 -wf all .\n\n", "Q: CPU Overusage Ubuntu 14.04 I'm very new to Linux and Ubuntu.

Would it execute and just infect my system or would it ask me for root?   \n\n\"an infected keylogger file\" you mean you have software for an Ubuntu system that is basically something that you expect to have a keylogger inside it. \nBiggest mistake here: you are not expected to download random software from random locations. In Windows this is common but in Linux you use the official repositories. Those are free of malicious software. Next to that you use a PPA from Launchpad. Those are less secure but they are tested and when someone tries to sneak in crapware it will be noticed very quickly. \nALL other locations: stay away from them unless you can validate the source (the official websites for for instance apache, mysql are obviously safe).\nOpening? No, if asked for a password it is not for the text file but for the program you use to open the text file. Executing the file is the issue and the problem. \n\nokay I don't want to ask too much questions but I just to know if every (or most) type of malware currently on linux requires root access? \n\nNo. Well made malware installs itself inside your /home or inside your browser as a plugin and does not require a password. But again: Ubuntu software from the USC and from PPA will not install in /home/ and will use USC and ask for a admin password. Only software you downloaded yourself from an obscure location does that. Why would you download random software from websites you can not validate their reputation?  In my mind if you do you are asking for it. \n\nBecause if it does wouldn't I have to be their to input and allow this ? \n\nOh but that is always the case.\nCurrently on Linux systems it is not possible to infect your system with a keylogger that sends out your admin password to somewhere in the world unless you install it yourself from an obscure source. Both the Ubuntu repositories and the PPA's on Launchpad are still considered safe zones in regards to that. \n(\"yourself\" here also implies anyone that can have access to your machine when you walk away from it since they then use your account ;) )\n", "Q: Ubuntu detects different keyboard on laptop I'm using WMware player on my windows 7 laptop.

I have noticed that when decrypting a file, it no longer asks me for the key's pass-phrase. Presumably because the pass-phrase is stored on the computer somewhere. But doesn't this to some extent defeat the purpose of encryption? I want my files to be secure even if someone malicious takes control of it. It seems a little like if when you start your computer up, ubuntu stored the password needed to login to your account and entered it for you automatically.\nSo how do you prevent kleopatra from storing passwords? And is there some way for me to have piece of mind that a clever hacker won't be able to search my computer and find the passwords they need (i.e. is there some where passphrases are stored? Id like to restrict permission to this file if so)\n\nA: Okay, after quite a bit of digging, I have discovered that the gnome-keyring is the culprit for caching the passwords.

I have tried multiple other sites and have found nothing. How would I do this?\n\nA: Using vim to add users/groups (by editing /etc/passwd,/etc/group,/etc/shadow,/etc/gshadow, ...) is The Really Hard Way.  \nI call it \"Really Hard\" for two reasons.  \nFirst, we already have tools to do that (and they do ALL the steps, and are upgraded as needed). Read man useradd and man adduser. One can use these tools to create a userid with an expired, empty password. This leads to NO password for initial login, and mandatory user password selection.  \nSecond, using vim in scripts is major overkill. Read man ed for a simple editor that will probably serve your needs.\n", "Q: Cannot open phpmyadmin after xampp installed on ubuntu I start xampp with sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start command but phpmyadmin doesn't work.\nstart xampp\nphpmyadmin doesn't work\n\nA: Probably because there are some misconfiguration on phpmyadmin and mysql connection.\nWhy do we have to install xampp if we can have LAMP instead with much easier way.

So, here are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this a feature or a bug?\n\n*How could I disable it / how could I enable pasting into this field? \n\n\nA: No, it is not possible, as the whole point of pinentry is that the password doesn't leak anywhere in plain text and using copy and paste defeats that.\nHowever, there is a workaround. If your password manager supports Autotype (as e.g. KeepassX and Keepass do), you can modify the autotype sequence. In Keepassx you would enter the following text to the Comment box of the entry:\nAuto-Type: {PASSWORD}{ENTER}\n\nand right-click on perform auto-type.

You've already got this, then, with the not being able to reach eth0 from eth1 and vice versa, so your issue is already resolved.\nIf you have some other question, though, you need to be more specific with what you're asking.  (The reverse proxying happens transparently, you won't be able to reach eth0 from eth1 or vice versa, not without going through nginx on the reverse proxy server).\n\n\nThe below is kept for historical reasons.\n\nI'm curious why this is tagged nginx, because this is not an NGINX issue, it's a case of you trying to go from inside (eth1 and the internal subnet) to outside (eth0, and the public Internet) without a router (or a system configured as a router) in place or a rule to let your 'server' act as a proxy from inside->out (which is NOT a reverse proxy).\nNGINX is not a proxy or router.  A reverse proxy will say \"OK, so send this request to the backend, abc.\"  Then, it'll say \"ABC: Send me the response\", which will send the initial request made from outside to the internal server.  That then gets you the response from backend 'abc' at the nginx server.  That is returned by nginx to the requesting client.\nA reverse proxy also only works outside -> in.  This diagram shows basically how that looks from outside going in:\n\nThe reverse path works, but only because the Reverse Proxy System (nginx) is waiting for response from the backends, and then hands that data back to the Web Browser or remote client making the request for information and expecting a response back.\nThe reverse path, however, does NOT permit you to go from eth1 on the Reverse Proxy to eth0 on the Reverse Proxy via the Remote Proxy system - that's not how IP routing works, and to achieve what you're looking to achieve, you need a real router in place that can handle network traversal from the Internal IPs to the outside, and then back to the Public IP address of eth0 on the reverse proxy box, so it'd look like this:\n\nThe data traversal here, then, would be from the internal boxes, through the router box they're connected to, out to the Internet, and then from the Internet back to your eth0 box. (The most basic way of explaining this of course).\nHowever, your Reverse Proxy box does not double as a router, so it doesn't work in the way you're thinking it does.\n\nOn another note:\nYou don't get to ping from internal (which goes to eth1) to eth0 directly, which is on a completely different subnet unless you go through an actual router and go outside then back in.  Unless you set up your server that also has nginx on it to be a router, which from your comments appears to not be the case.  So, this \"not able to ping across interfaces and subnets\" is expected behavior.\n", "Q: Using an external flash drive with a Snappy application I'm developing an application that utilizes the Raspberry Pi 2 and will most likely use Snappy.  Many of the systems will be standalone (not normally connected to the Internet).  I need to manage the software configuration prior to sale and upgrade the software when the Pi is connected to the Internet.\nFrom what I've read so far, it looks like Snapcraft is an appropriate tool, but I have many, many questions.  Let me start with just one.\nThe Pi has a permanently attached USB Flash Drive that I need to mount at startup.  My understanding is that I can do that in /etc/fstab.  Is that compatible with Snappy and Snapcraft?  Am I even asking the right question?\nThanks,\nBob\n\nA: That's a good question to start with! I don't think we've defined a formal way for a device to mount a disk. The general zen of Ubuntu Core / snappy would say that we want to offer that disk to a single snap (application) on the device.\nIf your device is really only going to do one thing, then that will be easy from a security point of view. If you are going to want to have a general device with all sorts of snaps from the store, then we'll also need to think about the security implications of mounting disks, because (believe it or not) mounting disks is not something that can easily be done securely; you prety much need to trust that the disk filesystem hasn't been designed to mess with your kernel.\nWe'd probably be comfortable with this in  general purpose device (with other snaps from the store) if it was an ext4 disk.\nI would suggest you bounce this question to the snappy-devel list, it's a very good one.\n", "Q: installation of 15.10 failed I've run the ubuntu installation from an USB stick and starts well.

Peter Anvin et al\nBoot Error\n\nAny key pressed make that message repeat.\nI often install ubuntu with live usb, using either usb-creator-gtk or UNetbootin. I actually already installed ubuntu (14.04) on that computer a few months ago. I can't figure out the issue.\nAlready tried :\n\n\n*\n\n*different USB  flash drives\n\n*checking .iso integrity\n\n*renaming isolinux files to syslinux\n\n*checking for USB Mass Storage Emulation type option in Bios (no such)\n\n*UNetbootin instead of usb-creator-gtk\n\n*removing \"ui\" from syslinux.cfg\n\nA: According to the release notes at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WilyWerewolf/ReleaseNotes you can't use usb-creator from lower version of Ubuntu ( including 15.04) to make live-usb of Ubuntu 15.10\n\nDue to changes in syslinux, it is not currently possible to use\n  usb-creator from 14.04 and earlier releases to write USB images for\n  15.04 or later; we believe that it is also not possible to use usb-creator from a 15.04 or later system to write USB images for\n  earlier releases. For now the workaround is to use a matching release\n  of Ubuntu to write the images, but we intend to issue updates soon to\n  work around this incompatibility\n\nYou may still make it from 15.10 or from Windows(universal-usb-installer for example)\nI tested usb-creator-gtk from ubuntu 15.10 in my virtualbox, it crashed at the end of the process! So we have to say NO to usb-creator-gtk! Tested with unetbootin 608-1 installed through USC, writing to usb succeeded but usb is not bootable!\nHowever, I found away that worked perfectly inside ubuntu, even with older ubuntu version. \n\n\n*\n\n*Right click your ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso > Open with Disk Image writer\n\n*Choose your usb drive and click Start Restoring... and follow the instruction.\n\n\nThat usb is bootable without any error. After installing ubuntu, you will need to format that usb with gparted if you want to store data on that usb again.\n\nA: I googled the error and it led me to a page where it mentioned something about a bug in Ubuntu 15.10. I quit trying to create it on my PC then went on to do the following.\nSince my only PC with an OS was with Ubuntu 15.10 I had no other choice than to create a live USB from my android device to install Ubuntu on my new PC.\ntl;dr There is a bug in 15.10. So I created a live USB using DriveDroid and successfully installed Ubuntu on my new PC.\n\nA: After many hours trying to create a live USB of Ubuntu 15.10 from Ubuntu 15.10, I gave up and used a Windows 10 machine to \n\n\n*\n\n*Format the USB drive\n\n*Create the live USB with Live USB Creator from http://linuxliveusb.com\n\nA: It looks like the good old dd command works as well.\nJust to be clear:\ndd if=ubuntu-15.10-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M\nwhere X is your USB drive identifier. Use b, c, d and not b1, so use the drive, not the eventual partition.\nAt least on my machines, that are Thinkpads T420 and W520, so not super-new it seems to boot using isolinux, so like a CD/DVD.\nSome newer machine may have a different BIOS that doesn't allow that. EFI enters then in the discussion, but I'm not an EFI expert so let me close it here.\nVerified also with 16.04.\n\nA: Have you tried sudo usb-creator-gtk ?\n\nA: Try Rufus from any windows PC . Set up requires latest syslinux file which Rufus download themselves. I have successfully installed 15.10 with bootable USB created by Rufus after failed attempt with Ubuntu startup disk creator and UnetBootin. \n\nA: Not actually a fix, but I found a way to achieve a 15.10 installation. I successfully made a 15.04 live-usb (so it's definitely something about 15.10), and I'll make a release upgrade. \n", "Q: How to run Ubuntu alongside other OS on laptop How do you partition HD on Lenovo thinkpad to run Ubuntu along w/other enterprise software.

Clearly it is me and my computer so why on earth does it prompt me for my password every time, it is so utterly annoying. Is there a way to turn it off so it doesn't prompt me every time?\n\nA: Windows users can have administrator privileges on their accounts by default, which allows modifications to system files.\nLinux does not allow users to be \"administrators\" (called the root user in Linux). This is strictly a security measure to prevent downloaded files and programs from being able to modify system files and infect the entire computer. This means that the malicious program can only infect on a user-basis and not all users on the system.\nYou can read more about root privileges here: http://www.linfo.org/root.html\n\nA: I do not know why everyone is downvoting, it is a valid question, I gave you an upvote.\nLinux is not windows and a number of features are different. You will probably have better luck if you ask about Ubuntu and drop the comparison to windows.\nAt any rate, this is an important security feature (sudo) see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for general information.\nIf you find the \"time out\" annoying, you can configure sudo to not use a time out.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo#Reset_sudo_timeout \nwhich links to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudoTimeout\nAs this is an important security feature, I prefer you read the links and ask questions, thank you.\n", "Q: cant get Landscape to deploy OpenStack no matter what I try, it hangs between 50 and 82%.

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on a Dell Latitude E7450, with TeXstudio 2.6.6. I've been having GUI problems with TeXstudio since the automatic updates of the last few weeks (i.e. Oct./Nov. 2015). When I start TeXstudio, the GUI is almost completely gone: only part of the \"+\"-button for starting a new file appears, the rest of the window is grey. When I click it, a white rectangle appears, but no new buttons. When I open a text in TeXstudio, it does appear, but without scrollbars or buttons. Dragging with the mouse to select text results in selecting text a couple of lines away from my cursor. Logging out and in solves the problem, but it costs a lot of time to start everything up again, which naturally is destructive to my workflow. The problem seems to appear at random, but always while starting TeXstudio. Here a screenshot of the TeXstudio GUI after creating a new document and resizing (the latter creating the many horizontal lines). \nA problem that might be related is that the text of context menu items disappears in TeXstudio, as well as in Dolphin. This problem has occurred since the same time, is either there or not at startup of the appliactions. See a screenshot here. Only the item which has the cursor over it, and sometimes the one over which the cursor has last hovered, are displayed.

Give it a try. To find out the version of gnome-shell you're running, you can do the following:\ngnome-shell --version\n\n\nA: Most convenient way is actually installing prepared Ubuntu Gnome distribution.\n\nA: As the internal workings of Ubuntu are very much intertwined with Unity, it is quite hard to separate them and install the GNOME DE, so it is better to just do a fresh install of Ubuntu GNOME.

I used to think they just meant an argument or flag was optional, but [path...] and [expression] can't both be optional for find, right...?\n\nA: \nWhat do the square brackets mean?\n\nSquare brackets in a command synopsis mean optionality (i.e. whatever is listed inside of them is optional / not required in order to run the command).\n\nI used to think they just meant an argument or flag was optional, but [path...] and [expression] can't both be optional for find, right...?\n\nThey can; running find without [path...] and [expression] just prints the list of folders / files in the current working directory's hierarchy without any condition.\n\nThe [<expr>] construct along with other symbols / constructs commonly used in command synopses (e.g. |, alternation, and {<expr>}, repetition) are the same used to define formal languages in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), so EBNF's syntax is a a good reference to understand / remember what symbols / constructs in command synopses mean.\n", "Q: set gamma when lightdm starts I want to set the following when booting lightdm: xrandr --output eDP1 --gamma 0.8:0.8:0.65.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a startup application (works, but only after loggin in.\n\n*setting display-setup-script in /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/10-custom.conf (with both xrandr + bashscript.sh + xgamma)\n\n*Custom xorg.conf with gamma under Monitor.\n\n\nReally cant figure out what I'm doing wrong.

I understand that I am using the . node. And I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: It's as simple as removing the dot.\nYou can always run a program by typing the path to it.\nIf you type: /usr/local/netbeans-8.1/bin/netbeans\n/usr/local/netbeans-8.1/bin/netbeans\n\nwill be executed, no matter your working directory. The path is not relative, because it begins with a /.\n./program executes 'program' in the directory you're in.

Files) keeps its keyboard shortcuts in  ~/.config/nautilus/accels\nFile Rename is listed there as:\n; (gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/DirViewActions/Rename\" \"F2\")\n\nThe ; means that it is commented out and Nautilus uses the system default.\nIf you remove the ; and change the line to:\n(gtk_accel_path \"<Actions>/DirViewActions/Rename\" \"<Primary>Return\")\n\nThen File Rename will be changed to Control-Enter.\nIt seems that there is only one shortcut possible for each operation. Nautilus uses the last one listed.\nSo you can't have F2 and Control-Enter at the same time.\nIn order for the changes to take effect you have to stop nautilus. Run the following from the commandline (before you make the change):\nnautilus -q\n\n\nDetailed steps (on request):\n\n*\n\n*open Files ('Nautilus')\n\n\n*browse to directory .config/nautilus in your home directory\n\n\n*if you don't see directories starting with a dot, press <Ctrl>H or in the preferences for Files ('Nautilus'), tick the box for displaying hidden files.\n\n\n*right-click or double-click file accels so that it opens in an editor (likely gedit)\n\n\n*Alternatively, hit <Alt>F2 and give command: gedit ~/.config/nautilus/accels\nNow we have the configuration file in an editor, we have to stop Files ('Nautilus') before we can make changes. Again, two ways of doing this:\n\n*\n\n*Option 1: open a terminal window (Gnome Terminal) and kill nautilus, by issuing command: nautilus -q. Your Files window(s) should all disappear\n\n*Option 2: hit <Alt>F2 and give command nautilus -q.

Windows is installed on the first SATA disk (sda).  I want to install Ubuntu on the second SATA disk (sdb), which is currently empty.\nI have a reasonably good understanding of how UEFI booting works.  I envisage that I need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually partition the second disk using the \"Something else\" Installation Type, creating a ~250MB ext2 partition for /boot (sdb1) and the rest of the disk as an LVM PV partition (sdb2).  Then create root and swap LVs.\n\n*Mount the EFI partition on the first disk (sda1) under /boot/efi, so that the installer can put the Ubuntu UEFI loader files alongside the Windows ones.\n\n\nI am having two problems though.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I try to partition the second disk, I am unable to create an LVM PV partition.  That type isn't listed in the \"Use as:\" dropdown menu.\n\n*There doesn't seem to be any way to mount the EFI partition from the first disk (sda1) under /boot/efi.\n\n\nHas anyone else worked out how to get around these problems?\nThanks.\n\nA: Personally, when I want to use LVM, I set it up beforehand using other tools -- either command-line programs (gdisk, pvcreate, vgcreate, lvcreate, etc.) or a GUI front-end like system-config-lvm. The Ubuntu installer will then see the volume group and the logical volumes I've already created and let me use them.\nAs to the ESP, the Ubuntu installer doesn't let you explicitly set a mount point. If you ensure that it's identified as an \"EFI boot partition\" (I think that's what it calls the ESP), you should be fine.\n\nA: Before reading Rod's answer, I decided to try installing Ubuntu and Windows 7 the other way around, that is to say, Ubuntu on the first hard disk, then Windows 7 on the second disk.\nAfter the routine Ubuntu installation (with LVM), the Windows 7 install went without any problems at all.

I just want to uninstall Cairo-Dock, config files and all. As if, you know, I had uninstalled it. Lol. I've already \"uninstalled\" it via the Ubuntu Software Center, and it shows it as not being installed in there as well.\n\nThe first method proposed above:\nsudo apt-get purge cairo-dock && \\\nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge cairo-dock`\n\nIt will purge cairo-dock's configuration files and remove and purge not more and not less than what is not necessary anymore.\n\nWhich, for the love of all that is computerised, is it: \"input\" or \"inputted\"?\n\n\"Inputted\" sounds pretty awkward. I'd second \"input\": https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/30684/inputted-or-input.\n\nA: I'll try to answer to some of your question: purge is different respect remove because it deletes also the configuration  files in addition to all the packages.\nIf you want to completely remove Cairo Dock with all the configuration file you should use purge for the motivation I said before.\n\nA: Let's start with purge-vs-remove. Some packages include configuration files in /etc/ as part of their package. It is expected that some of these might have been edited by the user so apt remove doesn't remove them if you uninstall a package. apt purge will. Neither has any effect on user configuration files in your home directory.\nNow, as for removing all these things, everything cairo-dock depends on cairo-dock-core directly or otherwise. If you remove or purge that, everything else gets removed. So that's quite smart.\nHowever, purge will only purge configuration files for explicitly stated packages. If you purge something that takes out other packages, they will only be removed. cairo-dock-core doesn't have any configuration files. There's no point purging it.\nAll three seem fairly equivilent for your purposes. Targeting just cairo-dock-core is clever, but it doesn't do anything fancier.\n", "Q: login loop even after remove nvidia driver I've got infinite loop problem after installing CUDA (which automatically install nvidia driver).

Download the NVIDIA driver install script. Since you're stuck in a login loop, you can download the driver on another machine and scp it over to the affected machine. Don't run the script just yet.\n2.) From the terminal, use nano, vim, or another editor to create a file called \"/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\"\n3.) In blacklist-nouveau.conf, include the following lines:\nblacklist nouveau\noptions nouveau modeset=0\n\n4.) Next, run the following command:$ sudo update-initramfs -u\n5.) Run the NVIDIA driver install script with sudo. To be sure you're using the most recent version, use the update option. This downloads the most recent driver from ftp://download.nvidia.com and automatically downloads and installs it. For example, using the 361.42 driver:\n$ sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-361.42.run --update\n\nGo through the iterative process of installing the driver.\n6.) Run $ sudo nvidia-xconfig to generate a new xorg.conf\n7.) Reboot.\n8.) If you're trying to run CUDA as well, install it after getting the latest NVIDIA drivers all set with steps 1-7. Alternatively, the CUDA installer gives you the opportunity to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers along with the nvcc toolkit.\nGood luck!\n\nA: The easiest way to get the nvidia driver working at least for me was to use lightdm as display manager, delete .Xauthority file and install drivers and reboot, everything came up fine.

DD, of course, created a partition exactly 172 Gb in size, so I then booted off a Linux Mint Live CD and used Gparted to expand the 172 Gb partition to the entire disk, and it SEEMED to work fine... except that now, Ubuntu does not recognize that any changes have been made, and still thinks only 172 Gb is available.  Gparted, however, DOES see the resized partition, so as far as it is concerned, nothing is wrong.  This is a pure Ubuntu installation, no dual-boot.  I have attached screenshots of Gparted and Disk Usage Analyser's mutually incompatible results.  Has anyone seen this before?  Any ideas? \n![Gparted Results]/home/rex/Pictures/Screenshot from 2015-11-11 13:17:25Gparted Results.png\n![Disk Analyser Results for boot]/home/rex/Pictures/Screenshot from 2015-11-11 13:18:09Disk Analyser Results for boot.png \n![Disk Analyser Results for whole disk]/home/rex/Pictures/Screenshot from 2015-11-11 13:18:46Disk Usage Analyser Results for Whole Disk.png \noutput of sudo parted -l\nModel: ATA WDC WD5000AAKX-0 (scsi) \nDisk /dev/sda: 500GB \nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B \nPartition Table: msdos \n\nNumber Start End Size Type File system Flags \n1 1049kB 256MB 255MB primary ext2 \n2 257MB 500GB 500GB extended \n5 257MB 500GB 500GB logical lvm \n\nModel: Generic Flash Disk (scsi) \nDisk /dev/sdb: 15.9GB \nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B \nPartition Table: msdos \nNumber Start End Size Type File system Flags \n1 1184kB 15.9GB 15.9GB primary fat32\n\n\nA: For the record, I finally solved it: Logical Volume Manager (LVM) was having an argument with Gparted (Gparted thought there was now only one large partition after expanding /root to fill the whole drive, LVM didn't recognize the change Gparted had made).  I went into LVM, and, closing my eyes tight and believing hard in fairies, told LVM to \"Edit the Properties\" of the \"unused space\" to match what Gparted had done, and it worked!  I now have access to the whole drive.  I hope this helps somebody else in the same mess.\n", "Q: Is my rsync backup method safe? I made a very simple backup script using rsync that backs up some folders to an USB stick. This is just for quick daily backups.\nThe command is\nrsync -av --delete\n\nfollowed by --exclude options and the paths.\nBut now it occurred to me that this is possibly not safe:\nWhat happens if my hard drive gets corrupted, and some files can not be read anymore? Will rsync delete the files on the stick if it can't read the source?\nOr more generally: Is there any scenario other than \"me deleting the files on my hard drive\" that will lead to deletion of the files on the USB stick?\n\nA: First of all, --delete option can lead to some unwanted destructive results if you are unaware of the background. For example, if the source becomes empty then all the existing files at the destination will be removed or if some files are removed from source then those files will be removed from destination too.\n\nWhat happens if my hard drive gets corrupted, and some files can not\n  be read anymore?\n\nIf rsync can not read the source, it would show a permission denied message and won't do anything further. So your existing files at the destination will be safe.\n\nIs there any scenario other than \"me deleting the files on my hard\n  drive\" that will lead to deletion of the files on the USB stick?\n\nUnless your USB itself gets corrupted, no, there is no scenario where (you don't remove files from source, the hard drive and) the existing files on the USB will get deleted by rsync with --delete option.\nTest:\n% ls -1 source dest\ndest:\n\nsource:\nfoo\n\n% rsync -av --delete source/ dest\nsending incremental file list\n./\nfoo\n\nsent 143 bytes  received 38 bytes  362.00 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 16  speedup is 0.09\n\n% ls -1 source dest              \ndest:\nfoo\n\nsource:\nfoo\n\n% chmod 000 source \n\n% rsync -av --delete source/ dest\nsending incremental file list\nrsync: change_dir \"/source\" failed: Permission denied (13)\n\nsent 20 bytes  received 12 bytes  64.00 bytes/sec\ntotal size is 0  speedup is 0.00\nrsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1183) [sender=3.1.0]\n\n% ls -1 source dest              \ndest:\nfoo\nls: cannot open directory source: Permission denied\n\n\nA: An easy solution to corruption and deletion concerns is to employ a proper backup procedure.  Rotate a series of three (or more) USB thumbdrives, using the eldest 'backup' as the plugged in stick when you run this command once every week.  This way if you catch the corruption before you cycle through your USB drives, you can recover from it.  This is known as FIFO (First In, First Out).\nThere are other, more complicated schemes out there, all of which are compatible with your backup method.  A primer on some of these is available on Wikipedia at the following link:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme\n\n", "Q: How come I get \"mysqld.service failed to load: No such file or directory.\" Following this tutorial, I'm getting\n\n# sudo service mysqld start\nFailed to start mysqld.service: Unit mysqld.service failed to load: No such file or directory.\n\n\nA: The mysql daemon in Ubuntu is packaged as mysql, not mysqld.\nsudo service mysql start\n\nThat's really all there is to that one.\n\nA: \nWARNING: This solution will destroy any DB data you have.

Using GPT, but disk\nverification and recovery are STRONGLY recommended.\n****************************************************************************\n\nCommand (? for help): \n\nUsing -v and then -q, then rebooting does not fix the problem.\nComputer boots up just fine into the OS, though I had to install Wily in UEFI instead of Legacy, as Legacy wouldn't boot up into the OS.\n\nA: Up-front: I'm the author of GPT fdisk (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk), so I understand GPT data structures pretty well.\nIf Windows is booting in BIOS mode, then it should be booting from an MBR disk. If you've got just one disk, then it looks like Windows is booting in EFI mode, since your one disk uses GPT. (A caveat, though: If your partition table is badly damaged -- say with a hybrid MBR that gdisk is not recognizing for some reason -- it could be it's really a BIOS-mode installation.) I mention this because you said you performed an EFI-mode installation \"because [you] couldn't install it in Legacy\" mode. Rule #1 of multi-booting these days is to install both OSes in the same mode. In other words, if your Windows installation is in EFI mode, installing Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is something you should NOT be doing. This may be a bit of a side-track, since it sounds like you did the right thing, but I want to be clear on it because there are a lot of bad procedures out there that suggest installing in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode when that should not be done. I most especially want to make sure that you don't attempt a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode install to fix your current problem. Absent information that you've really got a BIOS-mode Windows installation, re-installing Ubuntu in BIOS mode would do nothing but create new problems atop the ones you've got now.\nNow, to your main problem: I've heard of this sort of thing happening -- that is, gdisk reports a damaged backup partition table, the user fixes it, and it turns up damaged again. The usual cause is that something else is overwriting the backup partition table. Sometimes this is RAID software. Motherboard-based software RAID (often called \"fake RAID\") can do this because some such systems use space at the end of the disk (where the backup GPT data goes) to store its data. If you've got just one disk, you don't need RAID, so you should disable your RAID settings in your firmware and in all your OSes. Rebooting with and without booting into Windows may help you figure out what's doing the damage, and therefore what you need to adjust. OTOH, if you've got multiple disks and they are being used in a RAID setup, then you need to activate RAID support in Ubuntu. This is covered many places; here seems as good a starting point as any, although I've not read it thoroughly.\nSuch problems can also occur because of advanced-feature tools like disk encryption or disk compression software. Such tools sometimes dump stuff at the end of the disk, assuming that it's unused. (Under MBR, space after the final partition often goes to waste, so this approach often works. It's not safe, but it often works.) If you've got such tools installed, remove them, or at least research them to figure out if they're compatible with GPT and update or replace them if they aren't GPT-friendly.\nIf these suggestions don't help, try extracting the last few sectors of the disk to a file with dd. You'll first need to figure out the disk's size in sectors (gdisk will tell you this), then use dd, as in:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=foo.img bs=512 skip=100021518\n\nThis command copies the contents of the disk, starting at 100021518, to the file foo.img. You'll want to set your skip= value to at least 34 less than the number of sectors on your disk, since GPT normally uses the last 33 sectors. You can then examine the resulting file with hexdump or something similar, as in:\nhexdump -C foo.img | less\n\nThe idea here is to look for strings or other clues that might tell you what's causing the problems. Of course, you should look at the end of the disk before repairing it. The final 33 sectors should be enough, since that's all that gdisk uses.\n", "Q: The Suspend is Killing Me (14.0.3, 15.10, Elementary Freya) Acer Aspire E11 Briefly I can't get this machine to suspend. Details and troubleshooting steps follow:\nI bought a brand new Acer Aspire E11 (http://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-ES1-111M-C40S-11-6-Inch-Diamond/dp/B00MNOPS1C). I made Ubuntu USB sticks for LTS 14.0.3, 15.10, and even Elementary OS (derived from 14.0.3). \nIt installed perfectly until it came time for a restart. It hung on a black screen (with the backlight on) for literally 30 minutes before I just force rebooted the system (I assumed it might be doing something in the background).\nEven after a reboot it never shuts down properly (I suspect this may be part of the issue).\nChoosing Suspend from the far right (gear) blacks the screen out and it just sits there until the battery is dead. \nOnline searches offer a bunch of solutions for other machines, in many cases pointing to forums and other documents that are just mind bogglingly confusing. I tried a few very carefully without a shred of luck. From what I gather it may have something to do with the graphics hardware but 100s of articles later I can't be confident that's the cause. \nI can bend Unix / OS X to my will but something as simple as getting a machine to suspend when I close the lid or click on the menu item is beyond elusive. This seems like a serious problem if any variant of Linux ever hopes to get consumer adoption. \nDoes anyone have a simple one or two step process that will fix this problem? Perhaps a pre-built script? This is just truly unusable at this point. \nMy mind is blown that something this simple isn't accounted for in the \"checking hardware\" part of the installation process. \nI've tried every combination of settings in the BIOS GUI, and obviously I'm using legacy boot. Three days into begging this thing to work it's completely failing at something as simple as suspending. I'm about to suspend it in a large body of water. \nAny help is much appreciated!\nP.S.

If you want to start with a clean slate, and completely wipe all ownership and permissions on the whole drive, partition or directory first, files and all recursively then start with:\n{sudo chown -R nobody:nogroup /path/to/directory/or/mountpoint}\nDo not leave it like that for long if you have safety concerns though. Unmount, remount, if its a drive. Pick an owner, make a new group and add those you want to give access to (don't use a users group), chown again to give that user and the group ownership.  If you add users to that group some day down the road, they will have the same permissions assigned automatically. Use acl to set read, write and execute permissions.\nIn most modern Linux distributions, als is enabled by default on ext3 and ext4 partitions and needs not be added to fstab options.  There are quite a few guides to using als so look them up, I found a GUI to make it easier called \"eiciel\" and when run with root permissions {gksu eiciel} it will let you set the permissions for the group with ease.\nSince so many think that sharing a drive amongst friends and family reeks of communist hippie commune gone amok, and don't get why anyone would want to do it, I just may write an EASY TO FOLLOW and THOUROUGH guide on the matter, as it seems to be fashionable around here to assume that everyone is familiar and comfortable in a terminal interface from the stone age!  FYI I am not a programmer, just a measly electrical engineer, and I had to go through a load of sites with, useless, partial and outdated and non descriptive information, to gather enough info to do it right without hosing the computer.\n", "Q: No access to my ubuntu OS after ubuntu upgrade from 12.X to 14.04 I have a laptop( sony vaio) with windows 10 and ubuntu.\nI had ubuntu12.x and I upgraded to ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit).\nMy card is a nvidia geforce 540M.\nAfter the installation the laptop restarted and what I got was a black screen with a cursor blinking!\nI tried to use the recovery tools and I logged in as a root.

I can't find any information regarding /dev/nvme, only /dev/sda which has always been what I've seen doing linux installations in the past. Why is it /dev/nvme now and how do I fix this? Thanks.  \nEDIT: It's probably also worth noting that I turned off secure boot and switched from UEFI to legacy because the ubuntu installation kept freezing at the purple loading screen on UEFI mode.\n\nA: None of the suggestions worked but I found the solution for me.\nWhen the installer asks how to partition, choose Manual, after that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select /dev/nvme0n1, it will ask if it should create a new partition table(only the first time) - accept that.\n\n*Select free space and choose to create an EFI boot section(in different tools this could be called differently but all should say EFI), set it to 500 MB(this should be first, before the other partitions inside nvme0n1)\n\n*Now partition the rest of the free space, for example setting all of the free space to be root /, ext4(it is recommended to at least set /boot separately).\n\n*At the bottom you should see a menu that asks where grub should be installed. Choose /dev/nvme0n1.\n\n\nDone, it is a very simple setup in reality and you don't need to disable UEFI.\n\nA: You need to tell the installer to install Grub to /dev/nvme0n1 (at least that's how it shows up on my NUC 5i5RYK with an NVMe drive. However, at least in my case, it appears the installer is broken as I still was not be able to boot into the newly installed system.\nHowever, I did find two methods that fix broken Ubuntu 15.10 boot failure after initial install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the GUI program Boot Repair:\nThe default or\n\"Recommended Repair\" doesn't work, but I selected the \"Advanced\nOptions\" and uncheck \"SecureBoot\" but keep all other default options\nthen follow the instructions, the system correctly boots to the\nnewly installed OS.\nResults available at\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/14439023/\n\n*Install Ubuntu 15.04 first, then upgrade to 15.10.

Each computer I have that only has the one Linux drive did not require UEFI Mode.  \nTLDR: If you have other systems installed on the same computer (even different hard drive) that use UEFI Mode, then ensure that you boot your live USB in UEFI mode.\nFrom askubuntu.com\n\nHaving a PC with UEFI firmware does not mean that you need to install\n  Ubuntu in UEFI mode. What is important is below: \nif the other systems (Windows Vista/7/8, GNU/Linux...) of your\n  computer are installed in UEFI mode, then you must install Ubuntu in\n  UEFI mode too. if the other systems (Windows, GNU/Linux...) of your\n  computer are installed in Legacy (not-UEFI) mode, then you must\n  install Ubuntu in Legacy mode too. Eg if your computer is old (<2010),\n  is 32bits, or was sold with a pre-installed Windows XP.\nif Ubuntu is the only operating system on your computer, then it does\n  not matter whether you install Ubuntu in UEFI mode or not.\n\nas for your Ubuntu freezing during loading there could be many other reasons that would merit a separate question\n", "Q: Strange window focus behavior with Ubuntu 15.10 and Gnome I am running Ubuntu 15.10 and ubuntu-gnome-desktop.

The problem is the \"right answer\" seems to depend very heavily on which release you are running and whether you have a desktop or server profile. I have a bit of both because I installed lubuntu-core to provide some basic remote X functionality and it seems NetworkManager was installed as well but we prefer to edit our network config by hand not use the GUI tools.\nSituation is I have a remote Ubuntu 14.04 server I need to reconfigure networking on. I need to safely add a bridged interface eth1 to the remote system without breaking remote connectivity. I have a new /etc/network/interfaces file I want to load but because I don't have an equivalent machine to test it on or physical access to the server I have some questions about my new configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the gateway configuration and metric in the file below valid for what\nI'm trying to do and,\n\n*Will network manager override or interfere with what I'm doing here? Currently when I ifup eth1 network manager just brings it\ndown automatically. I'm afraid to disable NM in case it kills the\nremote connection, and\n\n*If I reboot the system with the updated file and my current configuration should it be able to receive a remote SSH connection when it comes back up?\n\n\nThe server has NetworkManager currently running however I don't need it. I only care that the configuration in /etc/network/interfaces is used and that the machine remains accessible for remote SSH login at all stages of reconfiguration (ie, I do not want to get locked out by a misconfiguration or by taking both interfaces down without a script or reboot automatically and correctly bring them back on).\neth0 is the default interface for host traffic. eth1 is going to be a bridge for a KVM virtual machine with it's own external IP address. Both interfaces connect to the same physical switch and share the X.X.X.0/24 subnet. My understanding is I need a bridge for this to work BUT I also need to be careful about my gateways and metrics because I have 2 interfaces on the same network.\nThe host currently has the following NetworkManager status:\n# nmcli d status\nDEVICE     TYPE              STATE\neth1       802-3-ethernet    unavailable\neth0       802-3-ethernet    unmanaged\n\nAnd configuration in NetworkManager.conf:\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nI've created the new config below:\n# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address X.X.X.4\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network X.X.X.0\n        broadcast X.X.X.255\n        gateway X.X.X.1\n        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed\n        dns-nameservers X.X.X.2\n        dns-search example.com\n        # Interfaces with lower values get used first\n        metric 10\n\n### NEW BRIDGED INTERFACE ON ETH1 ###\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n        address X.X.X.7\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network X.X.X.0\n        broadcast X.X.X.255\n        # do I need gateway here or will it conflict with eth0 ?\n        # gateway X.X.X.1\n        metric 20\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet static\n        address X.X.X.200\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        network X.X.X.0\n        broadcast X.X.X.255\n        gateway X.X.X.1\n        bridge_ports eth1\n        bridge_stp off\n        bridge_maxwait 5\n        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed\n        dns-nameservers X.X.X.2\n        dns-search example.com\n        metric 30\n\nAs I said though, with this new config just added to the server an ifup eth1 only works until NM decides to remove it. That's making testing anything problematic but I'm worried simply disabling NM could be much worse.\n\nA: In the end I just replaced the eth1 config with \nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\n\n... crossed my fingers and ran reboot. The system came back up with the eth0 and br0 interfaces correct though the \"solution\" isn't one I was at all comfortable with and I'm sure a better answer exists.\n", "Q: Wireless lan QCA61x4 not working on Ubuntu 15.10 I've installed Ubuntu 15.10 on my laptop(Samsung NT900X3K-K78S)\nEverything works fine except wireless lan(QCA61x4).

The software is not perfect but it would be perfect enough if it restarted automatically.\nWhat is the best way to set something up to automatically check if the binary is running and start it if it is not?\n\nA: Elegant way of controlling your program is by creating script with PID-file mechanics, that will save program's PID to file, and check with it if process is still running:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPID_FILE=/var/run/rerun.pid # need root permission to store in this directory\nEXEC=/usr/bin/gedit # replace it with actual executable\n\nfunction run() {\n    # execute the program\n    $EXEC &\n    # save its PID\n    echo $! > $PID_FILE\n}\n\nif [ -e $PID_FILE ]; then\n    # check if program is still running\n    pid=$(<$PID_FILE)\n\n    # find the proper process\n    ps --pid $pid|grep -q `basename $EXEC`\n\n    if [ $? != 0 ]; then\n        # not found - rerun\n        run\n    fi\nelse\n    # no PID file - just execute\n    run\nfi\n\nNow run the script periodically (eg. in crontab).\n", "Q: How to get Mac style title bar buttons on Ubuntu gnome without changing rest of the theme?

The problem was that my grub2 bootloader was on a partition that was not actually mounted when the operating system was started. So grub2 didn't think that the latest kernel was available. The fix was to uncomment a line in my /etc/fstab file to have the bootloader partition mounted during operating startup at /boot and then remove the the /boot directory on the main operating system partition. I also reinstalled grub2 after this was complete. I don't know why my /etc/fstab file got messed up, I guess I must have messed with it at some point or used a tool that messed with it.\n\nA: running: sudo update-grub may solve the issue, it should re-order the kernel entries in the version order.\n", "Q: 15.10 - Unity-Mail not in Repository anymore?

Will it be harmful leaving the installed SPP_5.5.3 in Ubuntu? \n\nA: I can prove that wine does the job nicely. Both SPP 5.3 and 4.0 with wine are successfully installed on Ubuntu 15.10, though SPP 5.3 runs a little slowly but it works. I then picked an older version (SPP 4.0) to install and runs like a charm. Cheers!\n\nA: I use SPP 5.5 with Wine 1.7 installed from wine ppa and it works flawlessly. Just right click on exe and install, wine takes care of getting essential files to make it run.

But found some doubts. Please do help me on the same.\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nhttp://www.everydaylinuxuser.com/2015/11/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-alongside.html\n1) How is Ubuntu 15.04 different from 14.04 in terms of installation ? As the first link says 15.04 is quite easily installed than 14.04. Why ?\n2) Please do explain me about UEFI and secure boot and what do i need to with it. Why should i disable it ?\n3) Also is 15.04 good and stable enough like the 14.04 ? Beacuse I personally prefer the 14.04 due to the LTS offered. \nThank You. \n\nA: \nHow is Ubuntu 15.04 different from 14.04 in terms of installation ? As the first link says 15.04 is quite easily installed than 14.04. Why ?\n\nThe referenced statements are the opinions/experience of one person. You'd really have to ask that person to elaborate on the specific statements. That said, 15.04 is newer than 14.04 and so uses updated versions of certain elements. Some of these updates might improve your odds of getting a clean install. Some of these have been updated in 14.04 point releases, the latest of which is 14.04.3, so it's probably best to start with a 14.04 point release rather than the original (April, 2014) version of 14.04.\nRemember that any given install is a bit of a gamble. For me, 14.04 (even the original 2014 release) installs fine on many computers. Hardware released since then, though, may require new drivers that aren't present in the original. Random Person X on the Internet might have problems even with older hardware and so might make a more sweeping recommendation to install the latest version.\n\nPlease do explain me about UEFI and secure boot and what do i need to with it. Why should i disable it ?\n\nSecure Boot restricts what programs may run as boot loaders, based on cryptographic signatures embedded in the boot loaders themselves. Something that's not signed with a key whose public key exists in the firmware's database will not boot with Secure Boot active. The idea is to make it harder for malware to take over the computer before the OS has even booted. Of course, this is a good goal, but it creates an extra hurdle for Linux distributions, since the only key that's guaranteed to be present in most computers is owned by Microsoft. The good news is that Microsoft has signed many third-party binaries, including one called \"Shim\" that enables GRUB to boot. (GRUB then hands off control to a Linux kernel.) Ubuntu uses Shim as part of its boot process, so in theory Ubuntu should work with Secure Boot enabled.\nNote that I wrote \"in theory.\" In practice, Ubuntu usually works fine; but there are bugs (in Shim and/or in specific EFI implementations) that can cause it to fail. If you run into such a problem, you must disable Secure Boot or work around the problem in some way. Note that Secure Boot problems are almost certain to prevent GRUB from even starting. If you run into a problem later, like a blank screen once past the GRUB menu, the issue is almost certainly not a Secure Boot issue (although many people immediately think of Secure Boot and try adjusting its settings).\nAs a general rule, my advice is to leave Secure Boot enabled and to disable it if and only if you can't get GRUB to start.\nNote also that Secure Boot is just one feature of UEFI, and an optional one at that. Many EFI (UEFI is just EFI 2.x) systems lack Secure Boot support. EFI is a replacement for BIOS. This is a critical point; many people are under the mistaken impression that EFI is just an extension to BIOS, or a minor variant on BIOS. It's not; EFI is completely different. If you know how BIOS boots, forget it all when dealing with an EFI-based system. For more background on EFI generally, I recommend you read:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than the preceding one.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\n\nAlso is 15.04 good and stable enough like the 14.04 ? Beacuse I personally prefer the 14.04 due to the LTS offered.\n\nMy recommendation is to stick with 14.04 if at all possible. As noted earlier, use the latest point-release version, especially if your hardware is newer than the April 2014 release date of the original. If you have hardware problems (disks not being recognized, network not working, no sound, etc.), it may be worth trying the latest non-LTS release. At this point, that's 15.10. I do not recommend installing 15.04 at this point, since it has just a couple more months of supported life left. If you install 15.10, you should seriously consider upgrading to 16.04 once it's released; that's the next LTS version, so then you'll have support through April of 2021, should you decide to stick with one OS for so long.\n\nA: For UEFI and Secure boot please read the below.\nhttps://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/UEFI_Secure_Boot_Guide/chap-UEFI_Secure_Boot_Guide-What_is_Secure_Boot.html\nAND\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/library/hh824987.aspx\nHow to install Linux on a System with Secure Boot ? Check out this.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/175641/how-to-boot-and-install-linux-on-a-uefi-pc-with-secure-boot/\nAll these Links are reference materials which will give you a good overview of what the technology is all about.\nComing to other questions.\nUbuntu 14.04 uses the same Ubuquity Installer as 15.04. There are under the hood improvements made to the Installer with each release whenever required. Ths does not however indicate 15.04 is easier to install than 14.04. Support for UEFI Firmwares epecially the one's which come wth Windows 10 Pre-intalled may be better. However Honestly I have no Idea. Mine came with Win8 and I replaced it with 14.04 and it works fine.\nFrom a stability and support standpoint I would recommend that you use 14.04. It works fine with UEFI and Secure boot.\n15.04 is a stable release however supported only for 9 months. 15.10 is out, I would rather recommend 15.10 as it is a very stable release and good to go till 16.04.\nI hope this answers your question.\n", "Q: Problem during installation of opencart sir i am having a problem during installaton of opencart on my ubuntu pc.\nmy cURL and mcrypt is in off position while it required in on position.\n\nA: Run apt-get install php5-curl curl php5-mcrypt and then install opencart again.\n", "Q: How to make xrandr customization permanent in Ubuntu 15.10? /etc/X11/xorg.conf is not present on Ubuntu 15.10\nwhat should I have to edit?\n\n\n*\n\n*Video Card: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

It works well when you don't want to use pipes, or can't use pipes. \nFor instance,suppose I  have a list of files.

It's like asking when to use a Phillips or a slothead screwdriver. I can tell you what they all are, and what they do, but working out when you'd use each one, is up to you.\nAll of these are extensively documented in the TLDP Advanced Bash Scripting Guide. If you need examples, that's the place.\n\n\n*\n\n*< filename reads from a file into STDIN\n\n*> filename writes STDOUT to file, overwriting anything.\n\n*>> filename writes STDOUT to file, appending if it already exists.\n\n*<(command) absorbs the output of the internal command and provides a filename\n\n*>(command) provides a filename to the outer command but actually redirects anything written to it to the STDIN of the internal command.\n\n*<<TOKEN is a here document, aka heredoc. It'll read anything that follows into STDIN until it sees TOKEN again. It's useful for multi-line content. It has to be followed by a newline. Unless you quote the token, heredocs support variable substitution.\n\n*<<-TOKEN is as above except that it will ignore leading tabs (but only tabs). This is handy to preserve source formatting but it really does only work with tabs. It's rendered useless on Stack Exchange sites because they substitute tabs for spaces :(\n\n*<<\"TOKEN\" is a heredoc that won't substitute $variables.\n\n*<<<\"string\" is a herestring. It's read into STDIN. This can do variable substitution.\n\n*| command joins the current STDOUT to the STDIN of command\n\n*|& command joins STDOUT and STDERR onto the STDIN of command (useful for grepping error output)\n\n*1> and 2> are used to explicitly redirect STDOUT and STDERR. > implies 1> so you rarely see it used explicitly.\n\n*In a similar vein >&1 and >&2 can be used to redirect into STDOUT and STDIN.\n\n*/dev/std{in,out,err} also exist as symlinks to the basic in/out/error file descriptors. This is dead handy when something will only accept a filename argument but you want it to write to STDOUT, for example.\n\n", "Q: Chrome is unresponsive and glitchy I've got a pretty performant laptop: a Thinkpad T430 with a top CPU, 16GB RAM (no swap), SSD, Intel 4000 GPU.\nIn Google Chrome (latest stable), I'm suffering from unresponsive and jerky scrolling. \nI've installed Kubuntu 15.10 from scratch, and now Chrome also has redraw problems: when scrolling or switching tabs, viewport tears and displays mixed portions of old and new viewports:\n\nThis shit is screenshottable, so it's not a hardware GPU issue.\nNeither of these problems happens in other apps.\nThe intensity of the problem seems to be proportional to the number of open tabs.

I have tried both the 14.04 LTS and the 15.14. However in the install I get ACPI PCC probe failed, sometimes it just crashes right there and sometimes it keeps on going but seemingly random freezes up and wont do anything until I restart. I  googled that one and to my knowledge there seems to not one ACPI-driver that fits this particular laptop. I have gotten as far as installing and booting into the OS but the mousepad and keyboard won't work and after a restart it won't boot into xubuntu again. So has anyone else got ubuntu working on the asus N552VX? \nFootnote: When it freezes I can't seem to get an error message, I know you can tap the right arrowbutton to see verbose output (of some sort)  but I can't indentify the problem.\n\nA: The linux kernel is having problems with the HQ6700 CPU: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109081\nThread comments say wait for kernel 4.6, but some \"get it to work\" with 4.4 and some special boot arguments.\n", "Q: Ubuntu: Update Scipy-stack for Python 2.7 I'm very fresh on linux, so there might be some obvious misssteps in what follows.\nI've freshly installed the last Ubuntu LTS version yesterday, and also pyCharm (Python editor). I went on updating the scipy-stack following the command on their website:\nsudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose\n\nHowever, now in pyCharm, I observe that scipy is not updated. Turn's out that there's several python installations available:\n$ sudo ls /usr/bin/python*\n/usr/bin/python        /usr/bin/python2-config  /usr/bin/python3m\n/usr/bin/python2       /usr/bin/python3     /usr/bin/python-config\n/usr/bin/python2.7     /usr/bin/python3.4       /usr/bin/pythontex\n/usr/bin/python2.7-config  /usr/bin/python3.4m      /usr/bin/pythontex3\n\n$ which python\n/usr/bin/python\n\nI'd like to use python2.7 as my main/standard python reference, and also update its packages. How do I accomplish that?\n\nA: There are actually only two python installations by default. 2.7 and 3.4 here. All the python-* packages are built for Python 2.7. All the python3-* packages are built for Python 3.4.\nWhat you are noticing with the version of scipy has nothing to do with the general layout of these Python installations, it's about how Ubuntu works. Ubuntu won't update every package for every update its developers push out. It only updates packages when there are security releases or things that make it drastically better. This provides stability for developer who don't want API/ABI changes on systems they've deployed.\nI suspect you actually don't want to be using Ubuntu's Python system at all, rather you want to use a virtualenv. These use the system's python (or python3) binary but you get to own the rest of the environment (site-packages, etc). This gives you near-total flexibility to install whatever versions of whatever from pip, without needing root, without trampling over system-managed files.\nNormally this is a case of creating a virtualenv, \"activating\" it and then installing your packages:\nvirtualenv /path/to/venv  # or python3 -mvenv /path/to/venv\nsource /path/to/venv/bin/activate\npip install -U pip  # update pip\npip install -U numpy scipy matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook pandas sympy nose\n\nNote the names of these packages might not be correct above, pip will tell you.\nAlso note that you'll likely run into a few errors about missing build dependencies. Packages you download from Ubuntu that need compilation (most of these computation packages) have been pre-compiled. You'll need to meet their dependencies. A dirty way of doing this is to use apt-get build-dep for the Ubuntu versions. If the dependencies between the Ubuntu and PyPi versions have deviated, you may have to install other things. See the docs for that project to find out what you need.\nsudo apt-get build-dep python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose\n\nTediously, this will install build-deps for both Python 2 and 3 but it's only disk space, right? :) You can fulfil the dependencies manually if you'd rather.\n", "Q: How to Select-All in Terminator How can I select all the text in a Terminator terminal?

I have installed this drivers rtl8192cu-fixes.\nHere is wireless-info.\n\nA: First, check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:\nsudo iw reg set IS\n\nOf course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/crda\n\nUse nano or kate or leafpad if you don't have the text editor gedit.

Run the fsck command manually. After that it will ask  some more questions - just answer y and press enter and finally reboot the server.\n\n\nA: Type exit into the prompt, and it should tell you which partition has an error, e.g. /dev/sda6. Type fsck /dev/sdaX -y where X is the partition mentioned in the error. The -y flag answers yes to all the prompts it would otherwise have given you - you don't have to use it but it is recommended.

Run these commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nMy opinion is that there is serious problem in Ubuntu with regard to SSD disks. The community should fix it.\nI have found a possible cause of this problem: Probably the system did not shutdown normally.\n\nA: In  (initramfs) prompt, type the command \"fsck\" then the path to your hard drive, for example \"fsck /deb/sda2\" , after add \"-y\" in order to accept all the fixing errors, for example \"fsck /dev/sda2 -y\", then the computer will check the errors on the filesystem to repair them.\n", "Q: How to allow scrolling to view complete command output in the command-line?

They sell a product for 26 and up. Start here\n", "Q: Installing the latest build of packages How can I install the latest build of a package? \nI am referring to the version of the package, because I see that other linux distros have more recent build of packages.\nFor example, ubuntu offers vlc 2.0.8 https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/vlc/ meanwhile arch offers vlc 2.2.1 https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=vlc (a more recent package).\n\nA: Go for its PPA or source. Ubuntu wants to make stuff easier for non-technical user, so it doesn't go behind latest which might have problems, but I agree sometimes Ubuntu is too late to the party and the cake is already eaten away. \nIf you want latest packages, then go for a distribution called Sabayon Linux here . They also have codecs, drivers pre-installed, chrome as well if that spy-machine interests you. \nAlso note, Sabayon is not debian based, but gentoo based, but they have a binary package manager, to make life easier. \nGood luck!!\n\nA: Every few days I run the following:\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs\n\nIf there are any updates to what I have installed, I get them. I prefer to get my updates/upgrades from the official releases. I don't want any added problems with someones PPA's or repositories. If you must have the latest and greatest, be willing to accept the possibility of crashes and catastrophic failures.

For one of my classes, we need to make sure our code works on the school's Red Hat server.  I had problems with dual booting Ubuntu and Windows 10 on my laptop, so I got a chromebook to use as my Linux machine.  Now my question is this: is there an IDE (for C/C++) for Ubuntu that will make it easy to do remote developing?  My chromebook does not have a lot of space, so any solution that is minimalistic would be appreciated.  I also need a way to make a VPN because only computers with a campus internet connection can access the Red Hat servers.  \n\nA: This is what I got to work for me.  I installed XFCE with croot, and the IDE that ran best on my Chromebook was CodeLite.  Google has a really nifty extension called Secure Shell which lets you validate your device and use a remote desktop without a VPN.  There is also a SFTP extension that integrates with the native file explorer, though it is a bit buggy. \n\nA: Eclipse will work. Mount the thing via sshfs (using standard Nautilus with sftp://user@server/path), add SSH invocations to build commands in the Eclipse project settings, set up remote debugging in Debug/Run settings so it also launches via SSH.\n", "Q: I want to install Cvode on ubuntu 14.04 LTS I am about to install the software “Cvode” which operates under LINUX, Ubuntu, and since I am a total novice in this field, I guess I need some directions which would tell me where I should start from and take me forward gradually to the final steps of installation. Is there anyone who could give me a hand on this? It would very appreciated. Thanks for your attention.\nYou can find this software here: Cvode. Thanks.\n\nA: The file you downloaded, cvode-2.8.2.tar.gz is a GZip-compressed tar archive. It contains the package you wish to install. Here is how you can get started:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory for unpacking the archive. I'm using cvode_install, you could use something else.  \nmkdir $HOME/cvode_install\n cd $HOME/cvode_install\n\n*Inspect the archive. replace /path/to/tarfile with the actual path on your system. Pipe the output to less to display it a page at a time (hit Space for the next page)  \ntar tzvf /path/to/tarfile/cvode-2.8.2.tar.gz | less -Mers\n\n*If the archive is OK, extract the archive into the current directoru ($HOME/cvode_install):  \ntar xzvf tzvf /path/to/tarfile/cvode-2.8.2.tar.gz\n\n*Look for, and read, files with names in upper case, e.g. README, INSTALL, they will help you find the next step.\n\n*If all there is is a large .run or .sh file, you can read it with less, or, if you trust the provider, run it with:  \nchmod +x thefile\n./thefile\n", "Q: ImportError: No module named builtins I am porting my python application from python 2 to python 3.\nAs python-3 provides utility 2to3 which converts python-2 code to python-3.\nimport builtins  giving error as\nImportError: No module named builtins\n\nAny idea to fix this issue?\n\nA: The 2to3 tool generates code compatible with Python 3-only.\nYou're probably seeing that because you're running the converted code in Python 2.\nIf you want your code to be compatible with Python 2 and 3, you can do this instead:\ntry:\n    import builtins\nexcept ImportError:\n    import __builtin__ as builtins\n\n\nA: Solved a similar error in a separate situation by installing the package future.\nsudo pip install future\n\nIt's not clear if your error occurs when running 2to3 or when trying to run the resulting code. If it is when running 2to3 it is likely because it's actually using python2 (the default) and thus if you haven't installed the future, builtins will be missing. Similarly if you are trying to run the resulting code with python2 the same error might occur.\n", "Q: Configure Wireshark for PPPoE connection Wireshark is not displaying my PPPoE connection in its interface list.\nOfficial wireshark website says PPP connections can be captured by configuring the ppp daemon and I've no idea how to do the same.\nMy Ubuntu version : 14.04.3\nWireshark version : 1.10.6 (from Ubuntu Software Center)\nMy Network Screenshot:\n\n\nWireshark empty interface list:\n\nI've even tried a solution from here but the problem still remains.\n\nA: Quit Wireshark, run the command sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common, and then start up Wireshark again.\nWireshark lists no interfaces, which means the problem may have nothing to do with PPPoE, and may have to do with Wireshark (or, rather, the dumpcap program it runs to do capturing) not having enough privileges to capture traffic.  Running Wireshark as root is An Extremely Bad Idea; the right way to give \"minimum privileges\" to Wireshark on Debian and on Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu is with the sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common command.\nWhat you read on the official Wireshark website is talking about capturing PPP control traffic; you can capture data, such as IP traffic, on a PPP device, with tcpdump/Wireshark/etc..  I'm not sure the PPP daemon is even involved with PPPoE, so that may not apply.\n", "Q: Where is it best to install a Windows program in the Ubuntu Operating system? I'm planning to install Microsoft Office on my Ubuntu 14.04. I was wondering if there is a location which is best to use for installing programs made for Windows.\nI'd like to keep my office when upgrading to a newer version of Ubuntu, so I guess I shouldn't put it in the root partition, in order not to get it overwritten?  \n\nA: I would advice against this.\nWhen using another operating system use the software included in that operating system. In case of Microsoft Office there is a perfect solution: Libre Office. It has close to 100% compatibility and supports xls(x) and doc(x). It is different yes and will need you to relearn using office (since LO does things a bit different).\n\nif there is a spot, which is best to use for installing programs, made for windows. \n\nSoftware from 3rd parties should be installed in /opt/ but this is for Linux software. There is no place to install Windows software in Ubuntu/Linux since that software is not made for it. We do not have a Windows runtime environment in Linux itself. \nIf you need to use Windows software you can do this using a tool called WINE. It is an attempt to mimic Windows but it is difficult to set up, hard to get working perfectly. It will make you cry if you want to use it for anything than the basic tools. Experience is important when dealing with WINE.\nIf you need Windows software and can not do without use Windows for it. Optinally you can do this with a dual boot (Windows side by side with Ubuntu) or with virtualization (Windows installed in virtualbox installed in Ubuntu).\nBut if I was you I would start with Libreoffice. You can even install it in Windows, get used to it and then decide to fully switch to Ubuntu. Same goes for other software: most of our software also is available on Windows. \n\nA: Good luck!  Most MS programs will not run in Ubuntu directly.  You can try Wine, PlayOnLinux a virtual machine such as VMPlayer or VirtualBox, or a dual boot.\nAdditionally, if you are just looking for the MS Office suite, you can run them online in a browser in a manner similar to google docs.\n\nA: your home directory? during and after upgrade files in your home directory are not touched\nYou will need Wine program to install Windows applications and by default it keep all installed windows programs in your home directory\n(not a part of this answer but, LibreOffice is good, free alternative to Windows Office)\n\nA: Microsoft Office works through the wine subsystem, which translates Windows system calls to native ones on-the-fly.  If you are not experienced with using it, I think it would be a good idea to use PlayOnLinux as a frontend to wine.  PlayOnLinux can be installed from the software center or by sudo apt-get install playonlinux.\nOnce PlayOnLinux is installed, perform the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Lower your expectations.\n\n*Run PlayOnLinux from your menu.\n\n*Pick Install a program from actions at top right.\n\n*Click Office at the top and choose your version of Microsoft Office from the list.\n\n*Click Install and follow the prompts.\nAt this point, PlayOnLinux will create the location to which Microsoft Office will be installed; during the process, accept the default install location (probably something starting with C:\\Program Files...).  This will be mapped automatically to a directory under your user directory.\nAssuming all goes well (not a foregone conclusion), you'll be able to run your Microsoft Office applications from your menu.\nThis same/similar procedure can be used to install almost any wine-compatible Windows application.  That step one above is always the most important.\n", "Q: Can't find USB flash drive in terminal in VirtualBox guest I'm running Ubuntu on a VirtualBox with the purpose of building an LFS. \nAt first I had trouble getting my flash drive to be detected, It wouldn't show up on my disks. But I fixed the issue. \nNow, when I try to access my flash drive from the terminal it says the drive doesn't exist. I can see it clearly on my drives under /dev/sdb, but my terminal is saying it cant detect that drive. \nThe flash drive is completely empty. And I'm running my VirtualBox on Windows 10.\n\nA: You need to set Virtualbox to share that specific usb device.\nTo make sure Ubuntu sees it, run lsusb with it attached and unattached. If it displays in that listing it is at least seeing it, and it should display the drive in Files.\n", "Q: Thinkpad Hardware problem after 14.04 regular Update I run Ubuntu 14.04 on a T430 ThinkPad.\nAfter a automated update some of my hardware was not working any more:\n1) external mouse 2) external keyboard 3) external screen 4) wireless\nI have run the following set of commands:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f dist-upgrade\n\nand got the following message:\ndpkg: error processing package linux-image-extra-3.13.0-68-generic (--configure):\npackage linux-image-extra-3.13.0-68-generic is not ready for configuration\ncannot configure (current status `half-installed')\nErrors were encountered while processing:\nlinux-image-extra-3.13.0-68-generic\n\nN: Ignoring file '20auto-upgrades.ucf-dist' in directory '/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/' as it has an invalid filename extension\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) \n\nIn turn I made a backup of the file 20 auto... and subsequently deleted it and again:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f dist-upgrade\n\nNow it is not showing any problems that I can see.\nHowever the Thinkpad hardware is still not working.\nAny help?\n\nA: You provide very little information on what exactly went wrong during the upgrade (power loss?

Any explanation will be welcome\n\nA: So it sounds like Ubuntu can't properly turn off your hard drive or CPU/GPU. This can be related to drivers, the kernel, or the installation itself. \nIf you're using the proprietary Nividia/AMD drivers try turning them off. If you're using the open source Xorg drivers, try installation the proprietary drivers.\nOtherwise, I've seen some shut off problems which relate to BIOS security ie. secureboot. By default, Windows 8.1 requires secureboot. While Linux does support this functionality, I try to avoid it at all costs. Basically, your Ubuntu can't access the hardware properly because your BIOS is blocking it.\nWhat we need to know is your dual boot set up. Did you install Ubuntu in a loop mounted volume through the installer file from Ubuntu's website? Or did you use a bootable USB and install it directly into the BIOS?\n", "Q: Why are there so many 32-bit dependencies for Skype?

I am running 64-bit Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: Skype is a 32-bit application and 32-bit applications need 32-bit libraries.\nIf an application needs many libraries and it is a 32-bit one it obviously needs many 32-bit libraries.\n\nA: Because your system is a 64-bit system, and has almost no 32-bit packages / libraries installed by default.\nOn a 64-bit system, 32-bit packages, contrarily to 64-bit packages, can take advantage only of a few already installed packages / libraries: those few installed by default and those installed manually.\nOn a 64-bit system the 64-bit version of almost all those packages / libraries is installed by default.\nIf you want proofs, compare the list of packages to be installed to the list of packages installed in your system in an architecture-agnostic way (dpkg-query -f '${Binary:package}\\n' -W lists all the packages installed in your system; sed -n '/:i386/!s/:amd64//p' prints only the lines not ending with :i386 and removes a trailing :amd64 if present; \"list\" contains the list of packages in your question without the trailing :i386):\n% comm -13 <(dpkg-query -f '${Binary:package}\\n' -W | sed -n '/:i386/!s/:amd64//p' | sort) <(sort list)\n\nYou'll see that the architecture-agnostic list of packages to be installed (i.e. the list of packages you don't have installed in their 32-bit / 64-bit version already) will shrink to something similar to this:\nlibdbusmenu-qt2\nlibqt4-opengl\nlibqtwebkit4\nskype-bin\nsni-qt\n\n\nA: A simpler answer is that Linux Skype was written quite some time ago and is being maintained, not rewritten, currently. At some point in the future, there will be few or no 32bit users left, and they might rewrite at that point.\nA longer view is that you can fairly easily add 32bit libs to your system and run the 32bit app, while a 32bit user cannot do the reverse, so Microsoft made Skype 32bit from end to end rather than two releases.\n", "Q: Unable to open LibreOffice Writer When I search applications and select LibreOffice, it asks me on the next screen which one to open.

Likely, one of those things wasn't configured right and now the hardware is denying you access. \nSince you're working with NTFS, jump on a Windows machine and format it again and see if that fixes it. \nUnless you know what you're doing, always use a graphical bootable USB writer, and always format USBs back to normal using OS utilities.

I have Lubuntu 14.04 installed on an old XP desktop, which has an Intel Celeron 2.00GHz and a SiS 651 graphics chipset. I have upgraded it with as much memory as it will take (2GB DDR), and a 120GB SSD.\nBecause of the SSD, I want to reduce disk caching. So I have configured Firefox using the about:config settings: setting browser.cache.disk.enable to false, browser.cache.disk.capacity to 0, and browser.cache.memory.capacity to 1500000. I have also changed the virtual memory swappiness using the \"vm.swappiness=5\" line in the /etc/sysctl.conf file (and re-booted). If I \"cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\" I get 5.\nHowever, when I start Firefox and the Task Manager, I can see that the \"RSS\" for Firefox is 141.1MB, but the VM-Size is 686.6MB. So Firefox is still writing to the SSD, but by virtual swap memory instead of by disk caching.\nThe Task Manager says that total memory used is 259MB of 1984MB. So it's not like the computer is low on memory.\nHow can I get Firefox to use more physical memory and less virtual memory?\n\nA: I have decided that VM-Size is nothing to worry about. From what I can gather from googling, VM-Size is not swap file usage. It appears to be the amount of memory that a process could use, whether physical or virtual, but the memory is not yet required. Therefore the memory could be neither physical nor swap memory to begin with, if it isn't being used then it doesn't matter.\nI have noticed that the VM-Size for firefox will expand only to the value of my browser.cache.memory.capacity setting within firefox.\nWhen I set the swappiness to 0 in the /etc/sysctl.conf file (and reboot), then I check on the swap file using the command free -m while using firefox, I can see that the swap file is not in use. Therefore I can only conclude that the SSD is not being used to provide virtual swap memory while using firefox.\n", "Q: Increase Swap partion size My newly installed Ubuntu 15.10 can not enter hibernation.\nThe PC has 4gb ram, and the swap partion is 4 GB (but when I check the real size of the /linux-swap partion, I found out it is only 3.73 GB!), so is it the reason that the Ubuntu can not enter hibernation? \nHow big should the swap partition be so that the system can enter hibernation?

I would like to keep Grub on hand, however, with a menu entry for that.\nI've copied the most recent kernel and refind_linux.conf from /boot/ to /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu, and created the following refind.conf:\n#\n# refind.conf\n# Configuration file for the rEFInd boot menu\n#\n\ntimeout 0\nscreensaver 300\nbanner mybanner.png\nbanner_scale fillscreen\nscanfor manual,external,optical\n\nmenuentry Ubuntu {\n    loader /EFI/ubuntu/vmlinuz-3.19.0-31-generic.efi.signed\n    icon /EFI/refind/icons/os_linux.png\n    ostype linux\n    options \"root=UUID=92f926f7-19f8-4a2b-9e9a-bf91db475a3c ro initrd=boot\\initrd.img-3.19.0-31-generic\"\n    initrd boot\\initrd.img-3.19.0-31-generic\n}\n\nmenuentry Grub {\n    loader /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n    icon /EFI/refind/icons-backup/os_unknown.png\n}\n\nThe menuentry for Grub works great, but the menuentry for ubuntu so far only creates kernel panic (blinking capslock key, no boot) with and without the ostype and options.  By adding initrd lines, it now just says that it cannot find initrd..., tries again higher up, and dies.\nIdeally, I'd also like rEFInd to automatically update the ubuntu entry when the kernel gets upgraded. \nAs I mentioned, I'm keeping GRUB as well, so I'd be ok with passing control to grub transparently, but I couldn't figure out how to send options directly to grub if that's the recommended way of doing this.\n\nA: Unless you have reasons for not using rEFInd's auto-detection that you've not mentioned, you're going about this the wrong way. Namely, you should rely on auto-detection for both the GRUB and direct-boot options. A default install with default options should definitely pick up GRUB automatically. This would be equivalent to your menuentry Grub option, except that the description and icon shown by rEFInd would be different. (You can easily change the icon in a number of ways, as described here.)\nDepending on where your kernel is and how you installed rEFInd, your kernels might or might not be auto-detected. If not, the usual solution is to install an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your kernel. Drivers for ext2/3fs, ext4fs, ReiserFS, Btrfs, and a few on which your kernels will likely not appear all ship with rEFInd; and drivers for lots more come in the efifs package. Drop the appropriate driver in the drivers or drivers_x64 subdirectory of your rEFInd installation directory and rEFInd should be able to detect your kernels in their normal location. (Note that rEFInd 0.10.0 made some changes that help when using Btrfs; with earlier versions, you had to add @/boot to the also_scan_dirs line in refind.conf to detect kernels on Btrfs volumes. This is no longer necessary with rEFInd 0.10.0.)\nUsing auto-detection has some big advantages over what you're trying to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*There's no need to manually copy your kernel; rEFInd should detect them from their normal \"homes.\"\n\n*When you upgrade your kernel, rEFInd will auto-detect the newly-installed version with no need for re-copying the kernel or updating your configuration file.\n\n*It's easier. In most cases, auto-detection \"just works,\" or works with minimal extra configuration. (You may need to run mkrlconf in Ubuntu to get the right kernel options to be used in some cases.) The manual initrd= option can be finicky (non-obvious typos and simple mistakes often wreak havoc), but auto-detection of the initrd file is typically flawless on Ubuntu systems.\n\n\nThe biggest disadvantage to auto-detection is that you can't control the name displayed as a prompt for the kernel. IMHO, this is a small price to pay for the advantages.\nIf you insist on doing it the way you're trying, the problem you're having is caused by the fact that, unless I've missed something, you've copied the kernel, but not the initrd file, to the ESP. The easiest way to get it to work is to copy both files to the same location. You must then specify the initrd file using the same path you use to refer to the kernel. For instance:\nmenuentry Ubuntu {\n    loader /EFI/ubuntu/vmlinuz-3.19.0-31-generic.efi.signed\n    icon /EFI/refind/icons/os_linux.png\n    ostype linux\n    options \"root=UUID=92f926f7-19f8-4a2b-9e9a-bf91db475a3c ro\"\n    initrd /EFI/ubuntu/initrd.img-3.19.0-31-generic\n}\n\nNote that you should identify the initrd file either on the options line or on a separate initrd line, not both. (It would probably work with redundant specifications, but I can't guarantee that. At best, it could lead to confusion and/or extra work when you need to modify the settings.)\n", "Q: NFS hangs on resume from suspend [after Wily update] I updated to Wily a week ago.

I ended up on this path because Clonezilla wouldn't recognize the nvme properly.  I've tried diligently to get all this to work but none of the attempted would work.  In the end, I resorted to using dd to get my clone, and it ended up working dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=512 count=1 conv=noerror,sync.

When Ubuntu finds a newer version of linux-firmware it will be installed when you do updates\n\nA: First of all, you have installed an official linux-firmware package from an official Ubuntu repository. But you installed a version for Ubuntu 15.10.\nIt did not install automatically, because the Atheros new firmware is available only for Ubuntu 15.10 (wily) at the moment.\nVersion numbers for linux-firmware for different Ubuntu releases differ. That is why this firmware package will never be replaced by anything in Ubuntu 14.04.\nBut I do not see any reason to worry about that.\nIf you really want to bother about that, you can track if that new Atheros firmware gets into Ubuntu 14.04 linux-firmware package and when it does (if ever) you can remove that package and install a native one for 14.04.\nBut I can't imagine why that may be ever needed.\n", "Q: How to get Windows-7 to boot (GRUB/EFI problem) if this post would be better in the Ubuntu Forum just let me know.\nThe title is my problem and after much research and note taking I have a hypothetical solution, but I want to ask what others who know more about these things than I if it is feasible or what better solution there could be.\nEssentially I have two OS installed: Windows-7 Home Premium and Xubuntu 14.04 (Trusty).\nEach is installed on its own drive: Win-7 on a 120-GB OCZ SSD, Linux on a 1-TB WD HDD.\nSTATE OF THINGS:\nMy motherboard is the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H(rev-1) installed on a self-built machine purchased without any OS installed a couple of years ago.\nBoth drives are GPT formatted and the mobo is being asked by me to boot only in UEFI mode (\"CSM Support\" set to Never in the UEFI screen).\nSecure Boot and Fast Boot are disabled.\nMy motherboard (UEFI) shows three options as boot drives:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu  -> works fine, installed on 2nd drive\n\n*WDC WDC1002FAEX-00Y9A0  -> does not work, simply because the    (2nd\ndrive, HDD)        ESP which it point to is empty\n\n*Windows Boot Manager    -> does not work, installed on 1st drive\nI have one ESP on each drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*sda5, fat32 (the one being used by GRUB/Linux)\n\n*sdb1, fat32 (empty)\n\n\nI know that the 5th partition of a drive is a weird place for the ESP, see my\ncomments in the \"solution\" section below.\nMy GRUB menu is a mess: 9 options total, 4 of which contain \"Windows\" in their name, none of which work.  I know some of them were created by \"Boot Repair\" and I will delete them when I am more confident.  Despite all this my \"ubuntu\" entry in GRUB is functional.  I'm using it (Xubuntu) right now and have been for a few weeks.\nI will not get into the how my machine got to this state, unless someone asks.  This post would be too long.  Let's just say that I have used both Windows and Xubuntu, have upgraded Xubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04, created problems with the later, BIOS firmware update and other things.  Right now I am using Xubuntu but will have to reinstall it because of \"Locale\" problems which I can't fix.  Everything important to me is already backed up on an external hard drive connected via usb.\nMY PROPOSED SOLUTION:\nFirst I want to copy the content of an EFI System Partition from one drive to another, in order to keep and use both of them.  Of course I don't mean use them simultaneously.  I mean use the one on the first drive when that drive is selected as the first one in the UEFI's screen options, and the other one when that other one is the first.  If it is possible, and if that could be a solution to my problem, I would afterwards take care of updating GRUB so that it reflects the changes made.\nIn the end, I would like to have an ESP in each drive, sda1 and sdb1, a conventional setup in other words, but if it's too complicated or if it's better to have only one for both drives/OS I want it to be on my Linux drive (2nd, 1-TB HDD).  I would like to physically isolate Linux from Windows.  For me Linux is my workshop and Windows is a toy, I mainly play games on it and only locally and I've read an awful lot of posts about Windows installations that screwed up a Linux one, and a small number about the other way around.\nAbout my active/used ESP on my first drive (SSD, where Windows System lives):\nI have read many times that an ESP should reside near the beginning of a drive.  Although the \"order\" of partition certainly does not have the same meaning on a SSD as on a HDD, I would like to move it to sda1, but I can do that later, probably after re-formatting my entire SSD, and before reinstalling Windows.  Maybe I will try to just move my existing partitions with some program like PMagic just to see if it works.  I don't care that much about my current Windows setup, but if I can save an afternoon by not re-installing everything, that may be worth it.\nAnother issue is that I'm pretty sure any ESP partition should have the \"boot flag\" set, as opposed to a \"/boot\" partition but I would like a confirmation on this, particularly I'm not sure if a computer should have only one set at any one time, like in a case like mine with two drives each with its own OS.  I got confused throughout my readings about a lot of things because of the MBR vs. GPT stuff and this machine is my first dual-boot one.\n\nI already have a bootinfoscript output file and can add it to this if needed.\nThanks in advance for any comments/suggestions.\n\n                  Boot Info Script 0.61      [1 April 2012]\n\n============== Boot Info Summary: ================\n\n => No boot

This is too long and complex for human use, so programs use various shorthands to refer to this code. In GPT fdisk (gdisk, cgdisk, and sgdisk), its \"EF00.\" In most libparted-based tools (parted, GParted, etc.), it's a \"boot flag.\" Unfortunately, the libparted developers \"hijacked\" the \"boot flag\" nomenclature from the MBR boot flag (aka \"active flag\"), which is entirely unrelated to the ESP type code, although there is a vague conceptual relationship. This creates confusion, since in MBR, the boot flag is normally set on a partition that holds second-stage boot loader code, which in Linux would normally be the /boot or root (/) partition; but under GPT, the \"boot flag\" should be set only on the ESP. I recommend that you not think in terms of a \"boot flag\" on ESP disks, since that's a libparted-specific way of identifying an ESP. Instead, think in terms of the partition type (that is, that a partition is an ESP vs. a Linux filesystem partition vs. a Windows filesystem partition, etc.), and know that libparted identifies the ESP as having a \"boot flag.\"\nAs to the rest, Boot Info Script output would indeed be helpful. The real question I have is just where the Windows boot process is going wrong. Your report that it \"does not work\" is imprecise, which makes it hard to suggest solutions. What are the precise symptoms when you select a Windows option? What are the Windows entries in grub.cfg? (Boot Info Script will show this detail.)\nFor a few wild stab-in-the-dark suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and prepare the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. You can then try booting with it. rEFInd generally does a better job of detecting the Windows boot loader and launching it than GRUB does, so this might get you into Windows; however, if the Windows boot loader is missing or damaged, rEFInd won't help. One advantage of trying this approach is that it's very low-risk; unless you install it to your disk, rEFInd won't disrupt your current boot configuration, even if it fails to help. If it does help, you can install rEFInd to your hard disk and be reasonably confident that it will work as well when booted that way as it does when booted from an external medium.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool. This is more of a leap of faith; it will either work or it won't, and if it doesn't, there's a small chance that it will make matters worse.\n\n*Run Windows repair tools. This option may help if the problem is that your Windows boot loader files are missing or damaged. If you need help on this, you should probably ask on a Windows forum.\n\n\nKnowing whether to run a Linux-based repair, such as Boot Repair, or a Windows-based repair depends largely on determining whether your Windows boot problem is one of a bad GRUB configuration or missing or damaged Windows boot files. You can look for those files manually -- they should appear as EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi (and other files in the same directory) on one of your ESPs. If those files are completely missing, try a Windows repair. If the files are present, then either your GRUB configuration is messed up or the Windows files are damaged. (Note that \"damaged\" can include \"replaced by GRUB.\" Some tools, including Boot Repair, will sometimes try to fix Linux boot problems by replacing the Windows boot loader with another copy of GRUB, usually renaming the Windows files to something else to keep them accessible.)\n", "Q: How are the Official Ubuntu Vagrant boxes built and published to Atlas? Every week or so, a new version of the Official Ubuntu Trusty x64 Vagrant base box for Virtual appears on Hashicorp Atlas:\nhttps://atlas.hashicorp.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64\nPresumably, for repeatable consistency, this has all been automated.\nI know there are general blog posts about how a Vagrant base box can be built but I'm more interested in how these boxes are built. I'm hoping, that like the rest of the Ubuntu ecosystem I've encountered, the process for building these boxes is all public open source.\nUpdate:\nI'm specifically interested in the options chosen during the Ubuntu OS installation and any post-OS-install changes that are made before packaging the box.\nThe details of using Vagrant, Packer, or other tools to package the machine into a box are much less important.\n\nA: You would be correct that the build process for Ubuntu images is all open!\nFor 16.04 and newer\nLook at the livecd-rootfs package for how the images are built:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/livecd-rootfs/trunk\n\n*http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/livecd-rootfs/trunk/view/head:/live-build/ubuntu-cpc/hooks/042-vagrant.binary\nFor older releases of Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-on-ec2\n\n*https://launchpad.net/vmbuilder\nSpecifically: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-on-ec2/vmbuilder/jenkins_kvm\nAnd this is probably what you're looking for:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-on-ec2/vmbuilder/jenkins_kvm/view/head:/jenkins/CloudImages_Vagrant.sh\n\nA: I'm not sure what you are asking, and why.\nThe process for building an Ubuntu box, or any other box, is all public open source. Create a VM, install an OS, configure it for Vagrant, package it and distribute it. The guys at HashiCorp could not have done anything differently than the rest of us. They could have installed additional packages (besides the ones installed automatically when installing a clean, fresh Ubuntu and the ones needed to interact with Vagrant). They could have used the Vagrant provisioning system to update the box, after which they repackaged and redistributed. Or they used Packer. Either way, automating things like this is the HahiCorp core business I suppose.\nPerhaps check out Atlas (https://atlas.hashicorp.com/) and Mitchell Hashimoto's GitHub account for some more information on how Vagrant is used.\n", "Q: lxd forkstart: the famous error I just started diving into the cloud computing, trying to hypervisor my ubuntu server.

I know the eig() in numpy does the balancing of the matrix.\n\nA: The function eig is used to compute the eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) of matrices. In order to balance matrices you can use the function balance.\nYou can check Octave documentation on basic matrix functions.\nIf your question is related to details of its implementation you can check the eig source code. At a first glance it seems not to be implemented in the code (and no parameter for excluding the preprocessing balance is available, as for instance you can find in Matlab). Hence I would presume it is not performed. I guess you can perform the balance of the matrix yourself as preliminary step (and compare the results).\n", "Q: Making sure a bash script is run as script-specified user I want to make sure that the script doesn't get run as root on accident.\nWhat could I put at the beginning of the script that checks if the script is being run by a specific user and if not echo a sentence then completely stop the script from finishing?\n\nA: Just put this line after #!/bin/bash:\n[ \"$USER\" = root ] && echo \"This script shouldn't be run as root.

I have a shell script to set up radio shark stations and run the arecord and aplay commands. you need to pass the capture device to the arecord command. you can get the hardware device by plugging the radioshark into a USB connector and execute:\narecord -l. \n\nyou'll get something like:\nList of CAPTURE Hardware Devices\ncard 1: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC283 Analog [ALC283 Analog]\n  Subdevices: 1/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\ncard 2: radioSHARK [radioSHARK], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]\n  Subdevices: 0/1\n  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0\n\nthe shell commands I use are:\nsudo shark -fm 97.7\nsudo shark -blue 50\narecord -c 2 -f S16 -r 24000 -D hw:2,0 | aplay\n\nI have a java GUI application to run all this and select various \nstations but that's not working on Ububtu 14.04 yet.\n", "Q: Ubuntu re-installing everytime I restart my computer I'll just jump right into it.\nJust to give a sort of run down: I'm trying to install Ubuntu onto my windows 7 desktop so I can dual boot it.\nSo I was on YouTube looking up videos on how to install Ubuntu onto my hard drive without using a USB/CD. I came across this one video where the guy downloaded an installer and it automatically set up everything with a couple clicks. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p-jzAl6dos&index=28&list=WL)\nWhen I followed the download link he had listed in the video description this is what I got: http://prntscr.com/9274l5\nWhen I double clicked the icon it asked me to insert a disk into my computer to burn it. At this point I was really confused because this looked nothing like the video. So I search up a couple sources until I come across this: Install Ubuntu without CD and USB , how?\nI downloaded the program which the best answer had suggested. I then enter the file into it and put it on my C: drive. I reboot my computer and sure enough it comes with the option to boot up Windows 7 or Unetbootin. So I enter the Unetbootin option and everything loads up after 5-10 minutes. I start to try downloading Java and signing into my firefox account and notice my sound isn't coming through my headphones. I then tweak a couple things and restart my computer to see if the changes I made will take effect. But when I enter the Unetbootin option it just reinstalls Ubuntu all over again. \nI'm really confused since everywhere I look people who are having the same problem as me are using USB/CDs to boot up Ubuntu and from what I understand I have it on my hard drive already. \nIf someone could give me a hand that would be great!\nP.S: If what I described is too confusing to understand I could take some pictures of the boot-up screen and post them.\n\nA: Every time you reboot and select unetbootin, you are asking to reinstall. Select a different option at boot - hopefully Ubuntu is an option, if it really got installed.\n", "Q: how to make wi fi to work in ubuntu 14.04 and in dell n5010 Guys recently i installed ubuntu in my dell inspiron and after installing it my wifi is not working.

I'm experiencing some serious problems with Ubuntu 14.10 for a while.\nEverything was working fine for a few months on version 15.04, after which my system just started crashing out of nowhere, by what was caused by some GUI problem; the taskbar was disappearing, after which every program would freeze.\nRebooting would then give me the error 'ACPI PCC probe failed', sometimes combined with the boot process stopping at the GRUB commandline, or at a prompt which seems to be call 'iniframs'. In the last case I would see some errors like \"Target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init. No init found. Try passing init=bootarg\".\nI reinstalled the whole system to 14.10 using a LiveDisk, after which the problem was gone for a few months, but returned exactly the same last week.\nThis morning I booted from LiveDisk again, now running BootRepair, which suggested me to share a link whith some logs on this forum.\nThe logs: http://paste.ubuntu.com/13237424/\nOn another forum someone advised me to run a filesystem check on the root partition of the installed OS, with the command sudo e2fsck /dev/sdc1.

So please, before buying a new disk, check your cable.\n\nA: I had a laptop with a Samsung hd that started doing this (a crash, and a badblock on the following restart) and the SMART tool still gave an \"ok\" status. \nTry to boot for a live CD or USB and doing a search for bad blocks on the disk/partition affected: \nfsck -vcck /dev/<device-PARTITION> \n\n(Warning: it is bound to be a really slow and long thing --- in the hour range). In my case, it listed a couple more. After repair it all worked ok during maybe a couple of weeks, and then I had another one. SMART still saying that the disk was ok. \nI replaced the disk (with an SSHD, nice thing!) and now it's all working ok. So my advice is, at the first badblock --- make a backup every day and, at the second badblock, trash the disk and go for a new one. \n(BTW - as commented in the question, checking the SATA cable is also worth a shot - random errors in different spots can be a telltale symptom).\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Kernel \"linux-image-extra-3.13.0-68-generic\" Produces Errors During Update I encountered a kernel crash due to problems during an upgrade.

I have extracted a .dmg file into .img file following the accepted answer of this question. \nAt last I mounted it and extracted to /mnt directory. \nThat .dmg file was a software.

Most likely it contains software compiled for Mac OS X that you can not run on Ubuntu.\nIf the disk image contains executable scripts written in languages Ubuntu can interpret, or binary files Ubuntu can execute, the following method should work.\nOpen up a terminal:\nCtrl+Alt+T\nNavigate to the directory you mounted the .dmg in:\ncd /path/to/mount\n\nList the content\nls -l\n\nThis should give you a list of the files.

We only want to wipe the first 446 bytes which contain the boot code, and leave the rest intact, since it contains the partition table.\nThe following comand will zero out the required area, by writing zeros to the first 446 bytes of the MBR.\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=446 count=1\n\nPS: The X in /dev/sdX should be replaced with the letter from the device name. \n\nA: Another way is by diabling the boot flag\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the disk using fdisk tool\nsudo fdisk /dev/sdX\n\n\n*p to show the current table\n\n*a then the number of boot-able partition (the one with * in the previous table), to unset the boot flag\n\n*w save & quit\n\n", "Q: After update 15.04 to 15.40 VLC app did not work I've tried to upgrate VLC, with sudo commands it was not possible.\nNow I get some errors when trying to upgrade the system like:\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/videolan/stable-daily/ubuntu/dists/wily/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/videolan/stable-daily/ubuntu/dists/wily/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\nE:Some index files failed to download.

I have used vsftpd to share files over a local network on my Ubuntu 15.04. Its very elegant an I like it very much.\nI have seen many websites using ftp over the WWW. For example suse  and debian and many more.\nMy question is : Can I use ftp to share files over the internet without spending any money ? If yes,then how? Thank you!\n\nA: Well, yes and no.\nYou can if the following prerequisites are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a static IP address from your ISP\n\n*You know how to properly configure your firewall and port forwarding\n\n*You know how to properly configure ftpd so that you're not opening yourself up to quite as much of a security risk.\n\n\nIf any one of those fails then you can't do it.  If I were you, I would get DropBox (yes it's a referral link, so you will get free bonus space) and use that to share files.  DropBox is much simpler to use and is also very secure.\nIf you are dead set on hosting it from your own network, then you might want to consider the costs:\n\n\n*\n\n*In America, to get a static IP usually costs about 3 times more than a normal internet connection.\n\n*By running ftp on that connection, you open up a huge security risk.\n\n*Your ISP probably has a cap on how much upstream data you can use, so you'll likely run out of data much faster.\n\n\nNow if you're still set on hosting it yourself, then I would recommend apache2 rather than ftp.  Apache is a http server instead of an ftp server, and it's much more secure.  More information on apache can be found on the Apache HTTP server project documentation page.\nPlease, take my advice, don't try to host this yourself, especially with ftp.

Since you are a beginner Linux user, you probally erased the whole disk. \nTo answer your question about retrieving files from your previous OS. Yes, it is possible to extract files. (But you can't restore your Windows OS.) There are numerous programs on the internet to retrieve deleted files. When you delete a file, it isn't entirely lost. It still resides on your hard disk. What you should do is stop using the hard drive and plug it as a second hard drive in another PC. Then download software to try to retrieve those files.

What is the proper way to write that line?\nAlso is it possible to include the directory its from lets say\n/DRIVE2/folder1/folder2/folder3/folder4/file.ext move to /DRIVE/folder3/folder4/file.ext\n\nA: You should probably use -regex instead of -name - with -name, each extension will need a seperate -name test:\nfind .. -name '*.mp4' -name '*.avi' ...\n\nInstead:\nfind -regextype posix-extended ... -regex '.*\\.(mp4|avi|...)' ...\n\nGiven your array, do (ditching the unnecessary xargs):\nfind \"$SOURCE\" -regextype posix-extended  -type f -regex \".*\\.($(IFS=\"|\"; echo \"${MOVEFILES[*]}\"))\" -exec mv -t \"$DESTDIR\" {} +\n\nIFS=\"|\"; echo \"${MOVEFILES[*]}\" is a way to print every element in the MOVEFILES array separated by |.\n$MOVEFILES by itself is just the first element in the MOVEFILES array.\n\nA: You can do this by using only shell (bash):\nshopt -s extglob globstar nullglob \nmv -t /destination **/*(*.mpg|*.m4v|*.mpeg|*.mp4|*.avi|*.3gp|*.MOV)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*At first we need to set a few shell options \n\n*extglob will enable us to do extended pattern matching for filenames\n\n*globstar, after enabling this, by using ** we can traverse through subdirectories to search for the files\n\n*nullglob will result in a null string if no file name is matched by our given patterns rather than the patterns themselves\n\n*Now, *(*.foo|*.bar) is a extglob pattern which will match zero or more occurrences of either *.foo or *.bar\n\n*So combinedly, **/*(*.mpg|*.m4v|*.mpeg|*.mp4|*.avi|*.3gp|*.MOV) will get us the files to be moved\n\n*mv -t /destination **/*(*.mpg|*.m4v|*.mpeg|*.mp4|*.avi|*.3gp|*.MOV) will move the files to the /destination.\nExample:\n$ tree \n.\n├── dest\n├── foo\n│   ├── bar\n│   │   ├── baz.md\n│   │   ├── egg.3gp\n│   │   └── egg.mp4\n│   ├── baz.txt\n│   ├── spam.avi\n│   └── spam.mp3\n├── spamegg.MOV\n└── spamegg.txt\n\n\n$ shopt -s extglob globstar nullglob \n\n$ mv -t dest/ **/*(*.mp3|*.mp4|*.avi|*.3gp|*.MOV)\n\n$ tree \n.\n├── dest\n│   ├── egg.3gp\n│   ├── egg.mp4\n│   ├── spam.avi\n│   ├── spamegg.MOV\n│   └── spam.mp3\n├── foo\n│   ├── bar\n│   │   └── baz.md\n│   └── baz.txt\n└── spamegg.txt\n\n\nA: Using find with -regex\nMOVEFILES=\".*\\.\\(mpg\\|avi\\|m4v\\)\"\nfind \"$SOURCE\" -type f -regex \"$MOVEFILES\" -exec mv {} \"$DESTDIR\" \\;\n\nYou could also use -iregex instead of -regex for case-insensitve matches like AvI and so on.\nAll the \\ looks ugly, I know. -regextype posix-extended, as used in @Murus answer, looks better.\n\nA: find command allows setting multiple conditions with -o flag and you don't really need xargs, you can use -exec. Personally, I'd change your script to \n#!/bin/bash\n# script to find and move files\n\nSOURCE=/DRIVE2/folder/\nDESTDIR=/DRIVE/new3/\n\n\nfind \"$SOURCE\" -type f \\( -name -o \"*.mpg\" -o -name \"*.avi\" -o -name \"*.m4v\" -o -name \"*.mp4\" -o -name \"*.3gp\"  -o -name \"*.mpeg\" -o -name \"*.MOV\" \\) -exec mv -t \"$DESTDIR\" {} +\n\nAnother approach would be with a for loop , where we work on each extension individually\nfor EXT in ${MOVEFILES[@]}; do find \"$SOURCE\" -type f -name \"*.$EXT\" -exec mv -t \"$DESTDIR\" {} +   ; done\n\n", "Q: AttributeError: 'gi.repository.Gtk' object has no attribute 'gdk' I am porting python 2 to python 3.\nWhen running application giving below error:\nAttributeError: 'gi.repository.Gtk' object has no attribute 'gdk'\nAny idea to fix this!!\nThanks\n\nA: Well, without your code, I can't be sure, but this is most likely caused by an incorrect import statement. It's possible and highly likely that the import statement for Gdk changed between Python 2 and Python 3.\nTry changing the from gi.repository.Gtk import gdk line to from gi.repository import Gdk.

I, for example, have the webupd8 PPA for ST and a couple of other things, X-Swat, and Kernel edgers.  \nIf someone knows of a numerical hard limit, that would be good to know, but this is the reasoning on why I personally limit myself to a few PPAs.  \nEdit\nEvidently there is a hard limit related to GPG keys, and it is being worked on.  \nExcerpt:\nThere is a neat way to squeeze couple of PPAs more through this keyhole of 40...\nLook into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d and You might find some pairs or triples of same size.

My notebook is hp8560w. My notebook comes with no operating system so I have installed them both myself. I have no secure-boot option in BIOS menu (I mean the menu with system options, I don't know how to call it exactly because it's written at startup as \"F10 Bios Setup\" but I read somewhere that UEFI completely replace BIOS, so I'm confused a little about terminology).\nSome time ago I discovered there is an option in BIOS menu called UEFI Boot mode\n\nSo I assume that my motherboard supports it.\nWeird Thing\n\n\n*\n\n*After enabling it - when I boot Windows then restart the computer, my Boot Manger turns from\n\n\n\nto\n\nNote: these are not exact screens of my boot managers, my entry labels are the same, I just want to show the look. \n\n\n*\n\n*My windows installation boot a lot faster, from 30 seconds to 8, compared with Ubuntu installation that boots in 28 seconds without any changes. It seems like windows turns itself to UEFI but in Windows System Information I can read under \"BIOS mode\" that is still legacy.\n\n*When I boot ubuntu then restart PC, my boot manager turns into old one.\n\n*Same thing if I disable UEFI boot mode\n\n\nCan someone explain to me what happens.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it Windows boots with UEFI or not?\n\n*If not, from where comes this windows boot speed up and change in boot manager appearance?\n\n*Why Ubuntu doesn't change its behavior after enabling that option?\n\n*Is there a way to boost ubuntu startup like Windows does.\n\n*Is there a way to make ubuntu installation not changing boot behaviour, I mean switching to the old boot manger and slowing down Windows boot. Maybe some grub configuration? \n\n\nAny useful answer will be appreciated. Also sorry for my English I'm not a native speaker.\n\nA: Normally, people see a GNU GRUB menu when they dual-boot. But in your case the Windows boot manager took precedence and thus, you see that screen. That's nothing to be tensed about. It is not changing to UEFI.\nRegarding the speeds of booting, just do a restart in your Windows system and you will see that it also takes a long-time because in Windows (starting from 8) when you shutdown, it doesn't shutdown completely but instead shutdowns hybrid manner, i.e., half shutdown and half hibernate. Thus, when you power on your PC, it boots up at an amazing speed.\nUbuntu doesn't support this type of startup thus, it boots in the traditional way (Windows 7). And, so, is slow.\n\nA: First, terminology: EFI/UEFI is a replacement for BIOS. They work in completely different ways, although some EFIs (especially early ones for PCs) try to emulate the look of the BIOS configuration menus. Unfortunately, many manufacturers refer to their EFIs as \"BIOSes.\" IMO, this just creates confusion, because people drag in their BIOS assumptions, and as often as not, they end up making mistakes as a result. I suspect, but do not know for a fact, that manufacturers chose to do this because it's a sort of shortcut -- people who are even slightly computer-literate know what a BIOS is, so it's easier to just call an EFI a BIOS (because they fill roughly the same role) than to explain what an EFI is.\nOne extra point: Most EFIs on x86-64 computers provide a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables the EFI to boot using BIOS-mode boot loaders. This feature is provided as a convenience and a means to help bridge the gap as OSes slowly add EFI support; you can boot DOS, Windows XP, BeOS, NetBSD, and so on using a CSM on an EFI-based computer. You can also boot Windows or Ubuntu using a CSM, although both of these OSes also support EFI-mode booting.\nAs to what you're seeing, it's possible to switch between EFI/UEFI-mode and BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting of a single OS installation. This requires having both EFI-mode and BIOS-mode boot loaders installed. This is relatively straightforward to do for Ubuntu, if you know what you're doing. Windows, though, pretty much ties its boot mode to the partition table type -- an MBR partition table dictates a BIOS-mode boot and a GPT dictates an EFI-mode boot. At least, that's been my understanding. I recently encountered a report of somebody who claimed to have Windows booting in EFI mode from an MBR disk, but he had no idea how this setup had been managed. I suppose there's a chance that you've stumbled into a similar situation, which enables you to switch between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode booting. Another possibility is that you're not changing boot modes but you're switching something that's causing the boot-time graphic to change.\nIf you have stumbled into a way to easily switch the Windows boot mode, the reason it's not doing the same for Ubuntu is that you need to have both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boot loaders installed for such switching to work, and you've presumably got just one (probably for BIOS mode) for Ubuntu.\nI must advise you that you're heading into potentially dangerous territory, especially if you're really switching between EFI-mode and BIOS-mode booting. Such switching for Windows is not commonly done, so you're unlikely to be able to find any help if you take some extra step that causes it all to stop working. On the Ubuntu side, attempting to install an EFI-mode version of GRUB (assuming you've got a BIOS-mode install now) could lead to problems, since they might both try to use the same configuration file, but require slightly different options. To top it off, a lot of HPs have broken EFIs that tend not to honor their boot manager entries, which can complicate dual-boot scenarios. Thus, if you switch completely from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting, you may be in for a struggle to get it working properly.\nIn sum, pay careful heed to the saying, \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it!\"\n", "Q: Package mysql-server-5.5 is not configured yet Question\nI am installing a LEMP stack on a fresh minimal install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nWhen I tried to install MySql \nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\n\nit returned an error with the following explanation:\nmysql-server depends on mysql-server-5.5; however:\nPackage mysql-server-5.5 is not configured yet.\n\nHow do I solve this problem?\nWhat I have read\nThis question is very similar to Upgrade MySQL server issue, however, that question was (incorrectly, I believe) marked as a duplicate of this question.

I have just installed Ubuntu 14.04. Where I live, the internet connection often suddenly breaks! \nI missed the connection once while upgrading the system release which finally has lead to errors requiring a reinstall. I am afraid that my system will be damaged, or that I have to deal with errors after interrupted normal software updates as well.\nWhat are the possible dangers of losing the internet connection during software updates, and what do you suggest about that?\n\nA: The APT package management tool performs upgrades in the following way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download all packages that are to be upgraded\n\n*Install upgrades once all downloads succeeded\n\n\nSo should your internet connection drop while the upgrades are being downloaded, you'll receive a timeout exception and the upgrade process will be cancelled. So there won't be any harm to your system. If you experience this problem a lot, and are therefore unable to install updates, you can try upgrading single packages manually using\nsudo apt-get install <package name>\n\nHere you can insert the package names listed when executing sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. Notice that still multiple packages may need to be upgraded, if they depend on each other. Also, you may want to look at this related question.\n\nA: During normal software updates, I think a connection reset is not dangerous. It may lead to (sometimes persisting until you fix it) error messages of apt, but nothing that should really damage the system.\n\nWhen you run sudo apt-get update or let the GUI Software Updater do this manually or automatically as background task, it will fetch the updated package lists. \nIf the connection resets, you get an error that it failed to download a list.\nYou can (or must) simply repeat the process later when the connection is restored and everything will work again.\n\nWhen you run sudo apt-get upgrade or let the GUI Software Updater update installed packages, the process consists of roughly 2 steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*It will as first step download all new binary packages. \nIf the connection breaks during this step, there will be an error and it will abort. No package has been changed yet, no damage was done.\nYou can simply repeat the upgrade later (recommended, as you should always keep your packages up to date) or not.\n\n*In the second step, it will first unpack each downloaded package over the currently installed one and then reconfigure it, if necessary. \nFor both operations, usually no internet connection is required, because the binary package file containing all the stuff is already present on your disk. A connection loss will not affect anything.\nBut some special packages do not contain the real package, but just a downloader/installer application which automatically gets invoked and performs the real installation. (Updates are the same as reinstalling a package with a different version on Linux systems) Popular examples are the Microsoft Fonts ttf-mscorefonts-installer or the Adobe Flash player flashplugin-installer, basically most or all packages containing \"-installer\" in their name.\nIf your connection breaks during the second step updating/installing one of those packages, while the install script is downloading the real package data, this script will fail and the installer package will stay in an unconfigured state. You usually have to purge and reinstall it if that happens.\n", "Q: What is landscape and autopilot? Currently I am searching for an alternative for VMware ESXI. I came across Openstack. Now I searching and searching, but I just can't figure out what landscape and autopilot is?

Is one of them officially supported for Ubuntu by Canonical?\n\nI am interested in people who know something about software \"stability\", \"robustness\", etc based on their experience (or first hand authors of the ppa) with 2 or 3 of these repos. I asked because \"As anybody can create a PPA there's no guarantee for quality or security of a PPA - just like with any other unofficial software source you have to decide yourself if a PPA it's trustworthy or not.\"\n\nA: Yes \"stability\" and \"robustness\" with quotes, because there is not any thing perfect in the world. We are not perfect. If you provide \"robustness\" then you will need to update your software, also applying patch for vulnerabilities, add the compatibility with other software and more things. In some point a patch to your software will not be enough, because the technology never ends. All of this patches are not in the original conception of the software, and as is a modification you will always lose stability in the process.\nThe principal main problem with mint repository in Ubuntu, could be, have a reference of mint specific software that is not present in ubuntu. This fact could be the cause of the installations of unnecessary packages, also incompatible packages, and as a result breaking of your installation. The mint repository is not aimed to be used in ubuntu.\nWith the first two repos, the main difference will be that the tsvetko repo can be used for different Ubuntu versions and the lestcape repo is only provided for ubuntu 14.04. I don't compile cinnamon for more ubuntu versions, because this task was done by the Debian mantainers and in my opinion more than a help, this will create incompatibilities and then instabilities.\n", "Q: How to move windows files to ubuntu without dual booting?

I was wondering if anyone could help me with on how to install/dualboot a Windows 10 on a laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad T450s) that is currently running on Ubuntu 15.10? \nI recently uninstalled my Windows 10 on my laptop to run ubuntu 15.10. I sort of need to reinstall windows 10 but am unsure on how to do so. I can't seem to do it by making a bootable flash drive since whenever I try to run it, bios doesn't detect the bootable device properly. \nI tried the instructions on this link (How can I install Windows after I've installed Ubuntu?) but I always seem to get stuck on the installing windows part (since I'm installing windows 10 and not 7). Any ideas on how to proceed would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: For me it was easier to install Ubuntu after windows. Install Windows with the needed partition space you specify, then run the Ubuntu installer via bootable USB. Ubuntu will see the unpartitioned space. You can then install there. With this, you will need to boot into Ubuntu using the F9 option at BIOS boot so you can boot Ubuntu.

I know you stop supporting 7.10 is that mean is not gonna be updated too . Thanks a lot \n\nA: First of all you need to type sudo apt-get upgrade, so you forgot to type the 'o' in the command.Second of all Ubuntu 7.04 is over 8 years old, so I wouldn't recommend to use that. It does not receive any upgrades anymore so trying the command described above makes no sense anymore.\nFrom your question I understand that you think that Ubuntu is made by the people of AskUbuntu. This is not true. AskUbuntu is part of a group of knowledge exchange sites or Question and Answer sites to state it differently. Ubuntu is supported by Canonical which is a different company.\nMost computers that are not too ancient can run Ubuntu so I advise you to try Ubuntu 14.04 or higher. If your computer can't run this please let us know about any errormessages or anything else which enables us to investigate what's wrong.\n", "Q: Pitivi poor video quality I've been trying to use Pitivi to edit videos, but so far have been completely unable to persuade it to render them at anything like the source file quality\nFor example:\nSource file 1 minute length, bitrate 13.5Mb/s, file size 116.6MB.\nI have tried numerous settings on Pitivi and no matter how high I set the bitrate it flatly refuses to go above a bit less than 4Mb/s - file size around 19MB.\nI'm happy for the output to be .avi, .mkv, .mp4 or anything similar(but not .mov!).\nIs Pitivi really incapable of producing high quality videos, or am I missing something?\nThanks\n\nA: You probably just need to adjust two bunch of settings - the project settings:\n\nand the render settings:\n\n(With both check the audio settings as well, and when rendering select the appropriate output format and codec, then you could try the advanced settings')\nBear in mind if you make it to high quality many devices may have difficulty playing/rendering it - though rendering a HD version and using ffmpeg to make lower quality versions could work well. Also if you do test renders with smaller chunks of video means you can tweak the settings until you get the result you want, and then you can save a preset so you can use those settings later.\nUsing Pitivi 0.94, with everything possible related to codecs, gstreamer (see here for why) and ffmpeg installed. The manual is available here.\n", "Q: Isn't it counterproductive to have systemd, upstart and init.d all running at the same time in a system? I've been reading about the many different start up methods on boot by Ubuntu. And it's great that things are moving forward, but right now we have three different ways to start processes on boot, all running at once. Isn't this counterproductive? Wouldn't it be much faster and efficient if there was only systemd going forward? \nI struggle to understand how this works on boot, if they all go at once, or one after the other, hence why I am asking. \n\nA: \n… so either systemd is backwards compatible or all of them are running at once. This is why I find it confusing. \n\nThe root of your confusion is that conclusion.  It's wrong.  The existence of directories in your filesystem does not imply that the subsystems associated with those directories are running.  In fact, they do not all run simultaneously.  One only has to see the boot-time menu choice between upstart and systemd to understand that only one of these is active for any given run of the system.\nIndeed, \"init.d\" isn't a subsystem.  It's a subdirectory.  The subsystem would be System 5 rc, a subsystem which hasn't been the default on Ubuntu Linux for nigh on a decade, at the time of writing this.  Both upstart and systemd can read System 5 rc's files and symbolic links.  (In systemd's case, for example, it translates those files and symbolic links on the fly, repeatedly, into its own native mechanisms.)  But that does not mean that System 5 rc is running when either upstart or systemd are.  It most definitely is not.\nYour title question assuming those falsehoods as its premises is thus unanswerable.\n", "Q: Endless \"Out of memory\" error during live DVD boot process After trying to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7, I have lost the Grub interface to my Ubuntu Partition. This is my first problem :(\nAs explained here the boot-repair utility could give me a chance to recover my partition, so I tried to boot from an Ubuntu 15.10 live DVD. \nAnd now comes my second problem : the DVD wont boot, I get a never-ending \"out of memory: kill process\" message :(\nI'm completely stuck, any hint would be greatly appreciated.\nFor information:\n\n\n*\n\n*my system boot is a non-EFI classical BIOS\n\n*my current DVD is a functional one since I have already installed Ubuntu 15.10 with it.\n\n\nA: I was able to solve this problem in my personal situation, which appears to have been a corrupt partition table. Windows is still not bootable at this time.\nThe first step was to remove the hard drive from the computer.\nNext up was to make the hard drive an external hard drive. I had a SATA to external USB case. Attaching the drive to the computer would eventually result in a system freeze/crash.\nThe trick is to boot into a live CD or other Linux partition. When the drive is attached launch GParted or other tool used for writing partitions.\nCreate a new partition on the attached drive, you'll be warned that all data will be lost (perfect since it already has been).\nTestDisk should be run and used for recreating  the old partition table. Note that you may be able to do this directly if you're fast enough.\nGrub (boot loader) will need to be reinstalled onto the drive. It may be appropriate to do I recovery of Windows first then install grub so that Windows can be found.\nNone of these steps should make data recovery worse than it already is. Just don't add steps in there to create new partitions.\n", "Q: How to make Ubuntu GNOME ignore VMware's vmnet8? I'm using Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 and VMware Workstation 12.0, which installs its virtual interface vmnet8 for VMs' network connectivity through NAT. I'm using VMware on my laptop with ordinary eth0 and wlan0 interfaces. I don't have any other interfaces besides loopback.\nBefore VMware was installed, GNOME was displaying Wi-Fi interface in the top-right standard GNOME3 menu and also the Ethernet interface when the cable was plugged in. After VMware installation, it is now always displaying Ethernet interface as connected (probably due to detecting vmnet8), even though eth0 is down. A try at a visual explanation.\nI have already added the following configuration lines into /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:\n[main]\nno-auto-default=*\n\n[keyfile]\nunmanaged-devices=interface-name:vmnet8\n\nAnd I have also tried adding the vmnet8 definition to /etc/network/interfaces (as NetworkManager should ignore interfaces defined there), but it did not help.\nSo my question is how to make NetworkManager/GNOME ignore vmnet8 the way it's ignoring lo or Ethernet bridge interfaces (virbr0 for example...)?\n\nA: I found a very simple solution for this problem.\nJust type:\nvmware-netcfg\n\nin a terminal and remove the NAT and Host only Network interfaces, or any you want to get rid of. \nOf course you can't use them from now on. You have to use the bridged connection.\nFor me this connection doesn't show up in the Gnome networkmanager.\n\nA: I haven't dealt with this personally but I did find a post that may help you.  Helpful? \n", "Q: Is it possible to have multiple trash cans for separate partitions in the unity launcher? I have a separate drive mounted at /srv. If I create a /srv/.Trash folder files on that drive are successfully moved to a /srv/.Trash/1000 upon move to trash. If I don't have a /srv/.Trash folder I can create a /srv/.Trash-1000 folder which also works as expected. Since the system wants to store trash on the same partition from whence it came how can I create multiple trashcans so that I can empty the trash from a drive that's not root or home mounted? Any ideas? I've seen several related questions like this and this but I can't find anything that addresses this use case. I do not want the files moved to a different drive just to put them in the trash can, I'd just like to be able to easily manage the trash on this separate drive. \nEdit: I tried Possible to have 2 unity launchers? which appeared to raise the possibility of using Avant Window Navigator to accomplish a second trash can, possibly configurable via a gconf key as mentioned in post 5 here. Unfortunately Although it seems AWN is back in development, it appears that there isn't anything available for my current 14.04 installation. \n\nA: Workaround - Create a shortcut in Nautilus to the Trash folder in the drive desired in a new tab as seen below and manually deleting the folders files and info. I sincerely hope that someone can come up with a better solution while although this is a functional solution it is less than ideal.\n\nA better alternative is to use the trash-cli package such as described here which can be installed with sudo apt-get install trash-cli and empties all of a users trash with the command trash-empty\nThis could be dressed up with bells and whistles as described in this answer\n\nA: It appears that the root cause of this problem was mounting to a system_internal mount path which resulted in Trash folders that didn't have the sticky bit set. A Simple solution is to issue the command chmod -t /mount/point/.TrashFolder adjusting your path and folder name to match your circumstances.\nSource:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/516031/67643\n", "Q: How to ignore remove package from aptitude As i mention in Q. \nsudo aptitude install wine1.6\nThe following actions will

I'm new to Ubuntu and I've problem with port 6703 \ni executed this command \nps -ef | grep 6703\n\nand got this result \nuser 4378 4308 0 09:40 pts/2 00:00:00 grep --color=auto 6703\n\nbut can't understand what does that mean ? \n\nA: ps doesn't show network ports, at least not to my knowledge. The more appropriate command to use is netstat or lsof.\nFor instance, if I want to see whether or not my ssh server is listening on port 22, I can do this:\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ sudo netstat -tulpan | grep \":22\"\n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1012/sshd       \ntcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1012/sshd\n\nSame for lsof, if I want to check a specific port, like 58732\nxieerqi@eagle:~$ sudo lsof | grep \":58732\"\n[sudo] password for xieerqi: \nlsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user/1000/gvfs\n      Output information may be incomplete.\nfirefox    2491          xieerqi   65u     IPv4            1948841         0t0        TCP eagle:58732->104.16.113.188:http (ESTABLISHED)\n\nAs to why your command returned \nuser 4378 4308 0 09:40 pts/2 00:00:00 grep --color=auto 6703\n\nThat is the only string that was matched in the output of ps, in other words, grep command itself is the only  one on that list.

Any thoughts on this?  Thanks for your time.\n\nA: In general, yes. As long as you don't reformat the partition containing /home, a reinstall should leave your files alone. \nHowever, as noted in Zacharee1's comment, it's almost certainly better to just \napt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop\n\n", "Q: Is the \"Simulate clicking by hovering\" Ubuntu feature present in some form in Kubuntu? Ubuntu has a nice simulate clicking by hovering feature. Does Kubuntu 15.10 have a similar feature?\n\nWhen Hover Click is enabled, you can move your mouse pointer over a control, let go of the mouse, and then wait for a while before the button will be clicked for you.\n\n\nA: In KDE, you can use KMouseTool.   If it is not already installed, you  may install it:\nsudo apt-get install kmousetool\n\nFrom KDE documentation site: \n\nUsing KMouseTool is simple: KMouseTool watches as you move the mouse, and when you pause briefly, it clicks.\nKMouseTool's Smart Drag mode allows you to drag the mouse.\nWhen Smart Drag is enabled, KMouseTool pauses after it clicks down; if you move the mouse, it waits until you stop moving before it clicks up. This way, you can both click and drag the mouse. Smart Drag takes a bit more practice, but becomes natural once you get used to it. \n\n\n", "Q: How to install and enable at startup a VNC server on Kubuntu 15.10 What's the recommended way to install a VNC server on Kubuntu 15.10 x64, and configure it so that it runs at startup?\n\nA: The easiest solution I have found is RealVNC server:\n\n\n*\n\n*download, and install. (and buy a license if you need advanced features). Everything can be configured through command line if needed, otherwise it can be configured through GUI as shown below.\n\n*add RealVNC server to startup:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Run RealVNC server:\n\n\n\n\n\n*From the RealVNC client, you can connect using your Kubuntu login and password.\n\n*To change the options:\n\n\n\nI tried KRFB, but it doesn't save settings.\n\nA: sudo systemctl enable vncserver-x11-serviced.service \n\nthis will run it as a daemon at system startup. This daemon is provided with the RealVNC package and is the preferred method.\n", "Q: Note taking app for to use with pen tablets I am looking for an app that with which I can draw on it to make sketches and take notes with my Wacom tablet. It should preferably support \"new page\" so that after my work I can save the whole notebook as a PDF so that I don't have to save them one by one. \n\nA: I have another recommendation you might want to look into: Write by Stylus Labs. Disclaimer: I have yet to vet it (I just downloaded it and am about to use it for the first time...I will update my answer after trying it out). \nIt has one major advantage over Xournal, which is that it has infinite scroll. Looks like it has a lot of nice features, like being able to make bookmarks, and insert new text wherever you want in the page. \nTo install dependencies: sudo apt-get install libqt5widgets5 libqt5network5 libqt5svg5\n\nA: You could try xournal, I seem to recall it has support for \"export to pdf\": http://xournal.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: Try Jarnal, a cross platform portable application (java) for handwritten notetaking, pdf annotation.\nhttp://www.dklevine.com/general/software/tc1000/jarnal.htm\n", "Q: Possible Permissions Issue With Wordpress Plugins on Ubuntu Server So I just fired up a new Digital Ocean droplet running Ubuntu 15.10x64 and I'm setting up a Wordpress environment. I am setting it up from scratch without a Wordpress image.\nI followed a lot of the tutorials on Digital Ocean to get setup, and the site is running pretty well. I did not setup an extra layer of security with a 'wp-user' user and group because I was getting a lot of permissions issues when doing that.\nI can upload images, etc. fine and install plugins. However, I noticed that the there may be something wrong with permissions for plugins. I am running Wordfence for security and a plugin called Backupwordpress for DB and full site backups.\nBackupwordpress writes the backups to wp-content/uploads/backupwordpress.. but when I run a backup it runs as if its completing a backup, but the backup never shows. When I check the uploads folder there is nothing there... No errors, nothing.\nMy uploads folder is owned by $username:www-data as well as the backupwordpress folder with the permissions: drwxrwxr-x\nI've also noticed that Wordfence won't run any security scans, but again no actual errors.\nThe plugins folder has permissions of drwxr-xr-x.\nAny idea what I'm doing wrong? I use these plugins on a very regular basis (literally everyday) and have never encountered this so it must be my server environment. Also, are there any security issues I may have created while trouble shooting based on these usergroups and permissions?\nRunning a LAMP stack on Ubuntu 15.10x64.\nThank you so much.\n\nA: It appears this was actually a firewall issue, not a permissions issue. Opening up a certain range of IP addresses on UFW via the Wordfence support article fixed the issue. \nThe backupwordpress plugin seemed to work correctly once the DNS was resolved fully as well. \n", "Q: KRFB doesn't save settings I use KRFB 4.14.12 on KUbuntu 15.10 x64. Each time I open it (using krfb from terminal) and change the settings, if I close it, the settings are not saved. Why?\n\nA: It looks like it is a one-year old bug that still hasn't been fixed:  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=340411\n\nA: Either you are on Vivid 15.04 or you are using an outdated version?\nsee -> http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=KRFB&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all\ncurrent version in Wily 15.10 is: krfb (4:15.08.2-0ubuntu1) \nThis should fix it!\n\nA: You could place a bug-report @Debian & Launchpad-bugs against that package (haven't found anything likely there).

This is because Debian's\n# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,\n# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in\n# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as\n# possible.\n\n# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined\n# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:\n#\n#   /etc/apache2/\n#   |-- apache2.conf\n#   |   `--  ports.conf\n#   |-- mods-enabled\n#   |   |-- *.load\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   |-- conf-enabled\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   `-- sites-enabled\n#       `-- *.conf\n#\n#\n# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces\n#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the\n#   web server.\n#\n# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is\n#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be\n#   customized anytime.\n#\n# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/\n#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,\n#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,\n#   respectively.\n#\n#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their\n#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our\n#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See\n#   their respective man pages for detailed information.\n#\n# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in\n#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with\n#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not\n#   work with the default configuration.\n\n\n# Global configuration\n#\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# NOTE!

I have the following networking equipment available:\n\n\n*\n\n*Broadcom wireless card installed (it's a Dell) which I do not expect to get to work until I have network access by other means\n\n*Linksys AC1200 wireless adapter which I had hoped might work out of the box\n\n*Belkin USB hub with ethernet port connected to my router, which I did expect to work right out of the box, but doesn't.  (It does work on the same hardware but under Windows 10.)  Note there is no ethernet port directly on the machine, hence the USB hub.\n\n\nIfconfig -a gives me nothing but the lo loopback interface.  I'm not sure if I should see eth0, usb0, or both, but the fact is, I see neither.  Just the lo loopback.  \nHow can I get the ethernet-by-USB working so I can fix the other interfaces?\nUPDATE:  Other networking/ethernet issues run through similar questions before a solution can be offered.  I am running some of the more common requests and posting their output proactively to make things easier:\nOutput of lspci | grep Eth: Nothing, no hits\nOutput of lspci | grep USB: \n00:14.0 USB

in order to try to access your folders, so you can confirm if they exist or not, and, if they exist, see if they're empty or not. To do so, open a shell terminal window and run this supercommand:\ncd ~ && ls -las --color |more\n\nYou'll see a colorful list of all the contents of your home folder (/home/cosmin). Even hidden files and folders will be shown to you. Press the spacebar key to scroll 1 page down and see more of the contents of your home directory. Repeat the process until the end. This will allow you to check if your personal directories - like Downloads, Documents et cetera - are still there. If they are, you can cd into them and check their contents. For instance, if the Downloads folder is present inside of your home folder, then this supercommand:\ncd ~/Downloads && ls -las --color |more\n\n...will show you what's inside of that folder.\nIf your folders are not present, then they were deleted. I'm sorry, they're gone, you'll have to recreate them. Please read this post about how to create new user accounts, manually create user folders et cetera.\nIf your folders are present, then close your file manager and run this command in the shell terminal:\nxdg-user-dirs-update\n\nNow try to access your folder again. If it didn't work, run this other command:\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set DOCUMENTS $HOME/Documents\n\nIf it works, just repeat the process with your other directories:\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set DOWNLOAD $HOME/Downloads\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set MUSIC $HOME/Music\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set PICTURES $HOME/Pictures\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set VIDEOS $HOME/Videos\n\n...and so on.\nFor more info, run this shell command:\ninfo xdg-user-dirs-update\n\nIf xdg-user-dirs-update doesn't solve the problem, you may want to try something more extreme, like the following supercommand:\nsudo rm -rfv ~/.cache ~/.config ~/.local ~/.profile && sudo telinit 6\n\nThe supercommand above will delete your profile's cache, GUI configuration files, profile data and preferences, then restart the system. Afterwards, you may try running those xdg-user-dirs-update --set... commands again.\nIf nothing works but your personal folders (Downloads, Documents etc.) exist and are not empty, make a backup of them. E.g. if you plug in a flash drive mounted at /media/cosmin/BACKUP, then you can run this command:\nsudo cp -R ~ /media/cosmin/BACKUP\n\n...or you may prefer to copy folders one by one:\nsudo cp -R ~/Downloads /media/cosmin/BACKUP\nsudo cp -R ~/Documents /media/cosmin/BACKUP\nsudo cp -R ~/Pictures /media/cosmin/BACKUP\n\n...and so on.\nAfter the backup, use the control panel in order to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account and give it administrative privileges (this is gonna be your new account).\n\n*Then delete the (now old) account \"cosmin\".\n\n*Copy the contents from your backup back to your personal folders. Note: do NOT overwrite the folders!

Sorry, good luck!\n", "Q: How can I resize pictures in foot or inch units? I have many pictures. I'm going to resize them all together from command line in feet, or if it's not possible in inches.\nI know there are GUI apps that can do this but it works only one by one and it takes time to do this work!\nI tried the Convert -resize command but it's only in pixel format and when I check in Inkscape that size is not what I want.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: Image files like jpeg or png store discrete pixels only. How long 10 pixels are is purely a matter of convention or use. If you diplay the pixels on an old 70 dpi monitor, 10 pixels are 1/7 inch. If you print the pixels on a high resolution 1200 dpi printer, the 10 pixels are a mere 1/120 inch long.\nSo before you can talk about resizing in terms of real world lengths like foot or meter, you need to fix (fake) a resolution.\nThen there are still two ways to resize. Just pretend them to have a different resolution. Or have a program like ImageMagick compute a different number of pixels pretending they keep the resolution. In the end resizing always means to change the number of pixels, whether you do it explicitly or your display or print program does it under the hood to fit the original number of pixels into a given frame size.\n\nA: I got how to resize!\nFirst check picture info:\n$ identify -verbose file.jpg\nGeometry:\nResolution:\nPrint Size (inch):\nGeomtry=Print Size X Resolution\n\nThen do\nconvert -resize XxY! file.jpg output.jpg\n\n", "Q: Can't install wine1.7 on Ubuntu 15.10 due to a broken dependencies There's a broken dependencies:\nbalthild@Balthild-Linux:~$ sudo apt-get install wine1.7 winetricks\n[sudo] password for balthild: \nReading package lists...

I would just create a mount directory in /mnt (short for mount) or /media with\nsudo mkdir /mnt/sdcard\n\nThen mount it with\nsudo mount --options remount,rw /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdcard\n\nThis will mount your sdcard at /mnt/sdcard but note that the files will be owned by root, if you want to mount them as your user add uid=user,gid=user to the options (where user is your username). For example.\nsudo mount --options remount,rw,uid=myuser,gid=myuser /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdcard\n\nWhen you're done, unmount the SD card\nsudo umount /mnt/sdcard\n\nAnd then after you've removed the card, delete your mount point with (WARNING rm will delete whatever you tell it to! TRIPLE CHECK your typing for errors before you run it, especially as sudo!)\nsudo rm -ir /mnt/sdcard\n\nThats about it!

Now, relating this to an Ubuntu install, if I were to put GRUB onto the USB instead of my hard drive upon an OS installation how would this prevent against someone else who has a USB with GRUB on it booting into my main OS?\n\nA: I'm not really sure how it will work but I think the use of private/public keys will give you that uniqueness and therefore security layer. Somehow only your grub usb having the private key that will match the public one on the pc will keep others from booting the pc. I know you can put secure encrypted password to grub, so yeah something like that.\n", "Q: how to make cpugovernor intel_pstate stable? I am trying to set to a specific frequency in cpu governor. However, I am not being able to do so. My processor is \n12*Intel(R) Xeon (R) CPU E5-2620 v3 @2.40 GHz\nWith intel_pstate driver it gives freq range of 1.20 GHz -3.20 GHz. The current freq scaling, I can not set to a specific freq. I set the governor to performance. But it does not help.\ncpufreq-set -r -f 3.2GHz –does not work; \nI tried to set the lower freq;  cpufreq-set -r -d 3.2GHz; does not show any error, but even then the freq keeps on varying with time. \nI disabled intel_pstate (on boot) and activated acpi driver. But with acpi, the max I can get is 2.4 GHz at 12 cores. This 2.4 GHz, I can make stable all the time with cpufreq-set -r -f. But I can not set it to 3.2 GHz.\nCould anyone please tell me how to set use the cpugovernor, so I can set frequency to 3.2 GHz? My OS is ubuntu 14.4.3 LTS and kernel version is 3.19.0-25-generic. \nThe cpufreq-info shows the following result.\nanalyzing CPU 0:\n  driver: intel_pstate\n  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0\n  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0\n  maximum transition latency: 0.97 ms.\n  hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 3.20 GHz\n  available cpufreq governors: performance, powersave\n  current policy: frequency should be within 3.20 GHz and 3.20 GHz.\n                  The governor \"performance\" may decide which speed to use\n                  within this range.\n  current CPU frequency is 2.85 GHz.\n\nFor other cores also, the results are like this and current freq varies with time. \nscreenshot_i7z\npstate freq screenshot\n\nA: It is not possible for your processor to always be at your max turbo rate of 3200MHz all the time. If you have many cores active at once, then the max frequency will be only 2.6Ghz, and that limit is fundamental within the processor itself (see also your i7z screenshot - Max Turbo Multiplier line). However you can easily pretty much have all CPUs always at 2.6 GHz by setting the min and max percent numbers accordingly. However, note that you will still observe sometimes less frequency, as the processor can back off by itself under very low load conditions. Even easier would be to set turbo to off and performance mode, effectively makes all CPU run at 2.4 GHz all the time (but again, the processor itself can back off under extremely low load).\nExample for setting 2.6Ghz (if I did my math properly):\necho \"81\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\necho \"81\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/min_perf_pct\n\nExample for the non-turbo method:\necho \"1\" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\npowersave\n$ sudo su\n# for file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo \"performance\" > $file; done\n# exit\nexit\n$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\nperformance\n\n\nA: There is a command line tool for that called pstate-frequency.\nTo install it, simply follow the instructions in the repository.\nWhat the script does is that it allows you to tell your CPU your preferred settings regarding clock speed, governor and turbo boost.\nBut keep in mind, since newer Intel CPU's are highly optimized and do power management on their own you cannot force your CPU, rather suggest what you want.\nSee this from the description of pstate-frequency:\n\nFor contemporary Intel processors, the frequency is controlled by the\nprocessor itself and the P-states exposed to software are related to\nperformance levels. The idea that frequency can be set to a single\nfrequency is fiction for Intel Core processors. Even if the scaling\ndriver selects a single P state the actual frequency the processor\nwill run at is selected by the processor itself.\n\nTo get the highest possible clock speed (permanently 3.2 GHz (ideally)) and the performance governor execute this after installing the script:\nsudo pstate-frequency --color -S -p 3\n\nYou can use pstate-frequency -G  --color to get your currently set power plan.\nFor me using a intel i7-4790K I get permanently 4400 MHz with all cores.\nTo check your current CPU clock you can use:\nwatch -n 0,3 'cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"MHz\"'\n\nThis will list the clock speed of all your CPU threads.\nIn my case after setting power plan '3' ([...] -p 3) (performance) I get:\ncpu MHz     : 4399.843\ncpu MHz     : 4400.156\ncpu MHz     : 4391.093\ncpu MHz     : 4400.000\ncpu MHz     : 4400.000\ncpu MHz     : 4400.468\ncpu MHz     : 4400.156\ncpu MHz     : 4361.718\n\n\nA: With an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40GHz and an active intel_pstate/status I was only able to set the max frequency - it would still fluctuate between the hardware min freq. (1,2 GHz) and my set max-freq..

Been banging my head against the wall few hours now....\ntrying to recursively zip subfolders, but only the files in them. I've been trying to modify this script:\nfor i in */*/; do zip -j -r \"${i%/}.zip\" \"$i\"  ; done\nThis is almost perfect, but zipped files still has the actual subfolder with files in it.

I'm not 100% sure what I did that fixed it, but the issue seems to have been that my kernel headers hadn't installed correctly, I think due to some other installation failures.  (I noticed this because lsmod showed a lot fewer modules than I expected.)  I booted to an older kernel, which worked fine, then did sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (which prompted me to fix broken packages, which I did) and sudo apt-get install linux-headers-4.2.0-22-generic (since I had the 4.2.0-22 kernel).  This apparently caused kernel modules to get installed correctly, and then booting to the new kernel worked.\n", "Q: Must press \"Shut Down\" twice to shut down in Xubuntu 15.10 I am fairly new to Linux/Ubuntu, and I installed Xubuntu 15.10 on my Windows 10 64-bit PC last week so I can dual-boot.

I have installed Ubuntu minimal 15.10 while having windows 10 installed in my laptop.

I can't run live Ubuntu because it's a minimal image in my CD. Thanks a lot\nEDIT: I can't boot Linux right now because the menu doesn't appear. The computer automatically boots Windows 10.\n\nA: The computer is booting into windows instead of ubuntu because you don't have the partition GRUB is installed on marked as your first boot option. Go into your BIOS and you can easily change it... though the name of this drive probably won't show up as GRUB or Ubuntu, for me its just the name of my hard drive, if I want windows as my first boot option.. the drive is called Windows Boot Manager. \n", "Q: kubuntu 15.10 freezes intermittently - suspected compositor fault I upgraded to Kubuntu 15.10 couple of days ago and experiencing weird freezes.

You are also mis-typing the command: it is xdg-open not xdg -open (which will be interpreted as a command xdg followed by an option or options -open).\nThe xdg-open command is usually run from a regular Linux shell rather than from inside octave. If that was your intention, then you can exit octave by typing \nexit\n\nat the octave> prompt, or by hitting Ctrl+D \nIf you really intended to open a document from within octave then you will need to execute it as a valid octave command by wrapping it in a system() call e.g.\nsystem('xdg-open somedoc.odt')\n\n\nA: Example on using xdg-open with a newly made file:\n\n", "Q: I ve downloaded Super Hot (for linux) at the official site, but i dont know how to run it Heres the link:\n[LINK REMOVED]\nPlease let me know if you know how to run it.\n\nA: Run the following commands to run superhot. \nFirst, make a build directory and download superhot to that directory:\nmkdir SUPERHOT;cd SUPERHOT\nwget http://superhotgame-new.azurewebsites.net/BUILDS/SUPERHOT_Prototype_Linux.zip\n\nUnzip the file:\nunzip *\n\nChange directories:\ncd Linux\n\nNow, make the file executable:\nchmod +x \"SUPERHOT September 2013.x86\"\n\nFinally, make an alias for superhot so that you can run the game using a simple command (we escape the spaces in the alias):\necho 'alias SUPERHOT=\"$HOME/SUPERHOT/Linux/SUPERHOT\\ September\\ 2013.x86\"' | tee -a ~/.bashrc; . ~/.bashrc\n\nNow, run the following command to play the game:\nSUPERHOT &\n\nor\nSUPERHOT\n\nPlease post any errors, thanks!\n", "Q: Script for moving files that are older than 5 days I'm currently working on a script that allows me to move any file thats older than 5 days into an archive folder with the same path, except for the root folder which changes.\nSo something like:\nroot/subdir1/subdir2/file to rootarchive/subdir1/subdir2/file.\nIt should work recursivly.\nI've already tried creating a foreach for all the files of the \"root\" folder:\n#!/bin/bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.*' -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do\n      mv $file ../rootarchive/\"$file\"\ndone\n\nBut this didn't work properly as I the mv command couldnt find the specified destination ../rootarchive/\"$file\".\nHas anyone of you an idea how I could solve this problem?\n\nA: You need to create the directory tree from subdir1/subdir2/ - mv won't do that for you.

It doesn't appear in the system settings sound tab - only built in audio.\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: First, be aware for that display port to HDMI does not always transfer sound. Everything in your setup must be able to use DP for sound, even the adapter. Not all DP adapters will transfer sound. That being said, try alsamixer in terminal and change the settings there. If that does not work run sudo apt-get install pavucontrol and change your audio settings through there. \n\nA: This helped me in Kubuntu: https://askubuntu.com/a/519113\nYou can use pavucontrol (pulseaudio volume control, install if necessary).

The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. Some servers in this state may also simply refuse the socket connection, in which case a different error may be generated because the socket creation timed out.\nFixing 503 errors\nThe Web server is effectively 'closed for repair'. It is still functioning minimally because it can at least respond with a 503 status code, but full service is impossible i.e. the Web site is simply unavailable. There are a myriad possible reasons for this, but generally it is because of some human intervention by the operators of the Web server machine. You can usually expect that someone is working on the problem, and normal service will resume as soon as possible.\nPlease contact the system operators of the Web site (e.g. your ISP) to determine why the service is down. They will be in a much better position to help you than we are for this type of error.\n", "Q: Audacity hangs when using audio drivers other than JACK I have the latest Audacity version (2.1.1), yet it doesn't matter what version I use, because I've had the same problem since I first installed it months ago.\nAudacity has major issues when I use any driver other than JACK - it works flawlessly under JACK, but other sounds are completely disabled until I turn off the JACK driver.

I installed Mono+MySql and did some .Net development for a while as I am no Python or Java developer right now. I have no idea why, but my Ubuntu installation was bound to update center in my country (it is Georgia, small but lovely place) and as I gather this Update Center was not getting all the updates, or may be it was holding only important ones. So I had trouble with all those sudo apt-get ... commands all the time.\nAnd here comes the AMBLE - Couple of days ago I encountered an article on updating Ubuntu version, which required no more than running update-manager and switching to US update center and getting all those updates, including Ubuntu 14.10.\nSo I did all those updates, but I am not sure if I got 14.10 version, as when I logged into the system the background wallpaper still said it was 14.04. Anyway, then I ran 15.04 upgrade.\nFact 01 : After spending several hours of trying to get into the system I already know that it was bad idea to upgrade 14.04 to 15.04.\nDuring the upgrade to 15.04 my system just stuck at starting MySQL service, as many others did. I waited for couple of hours and then I just shutdown the machine as I had no other idea what to do with it.\nAs you may already have guessed I cannot get the system alive any more. The system boots up well, but when entering the password it displays some console text screen for a short time and sends me back to the login screen again. Unfortunately it is too fast to get any information out of it.\nWhat I have tried so far\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to load the older versions - Restart, hit Shift, select Advanced Options select other boot options - same effect in any of them.\n\n*Get to GRUB configuration screen, but unfortunately I have no idea what to do there.\n\n*Get to console screen out of boot options menu - same effect.\n\n*I've found USB Bootable drive from which I've installed 14.04, and tried to run boot-repair tool from it, no effect...\n\n*Right now I try to do some silly things, but that's all I can do, unless someone with better knowledge of the system can help me - I ran 'update-manager' in a live session system loaded from flash drive, just hoping for the best - that it would make some changes to the existing system on my hard drive.\nI do not need to save any data from my laptop, I just do not want to reinstall it, I really want to make it work. Any help would be appreciated, thank you all in advance. \n\nA: Assuming you have another computer, just download 15.10 Version from www.ubuntu.com, burn it to an USB using unetbootin http://unetbootin.org/, and boot your Ubuntu-PC with the USB plugged in. On the Ubuntu installation, choose the option \"Upgrade\".\n\nThis will keep all your files and upgrade your whole system.\nIf you cannot boot from the USB, change your boot settings in the bios.\nHope it helps.\nRegards\n", "Q: Skipping CUDA's EULA When installing CUDA on Kubuntu 15.10, i.e. running sudo sh cuda_7.5.18_linux.run,  how can I skip CUDA's EULA?

This is what I have:\n#!/usr/bin/bash\n\nssh -p 1111 server@server.example.com\n\nCURRENT=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')\n\nmail -s 'Disk Space Alert' username@example.com << EOF\nDisk usage is at:  $CURRENT%\nEOF\nfi\n\nthe name of the shell script is example.sh\nWhen I run it, it keeps asking me for password and once I am logged in nothing happens.\n\nA: First, generate a public key for use to log-in to the remote system without a password:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_username\"\n\nThis will generate a 4096-bit RSA key in your ~/.ssh/ directory with your user-name as the label. Then, add this new key to your ssh-agent so that it is used when you connect via SSH.\nssh-agent -s\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nIf you set a custom name during key generation, replace id_rsa with that name.\nNow, copy your public key contents to your clipboard.\nclip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nNext, log-in to the remote server with ssh -p YOURPORT user@remote.host and edit the remote user's authorized_keys file.\nvim .ssh/autorized_keys\n\nPaste in the contents you just copied to your clipboard.  This allows connections from your computer to the remote host without password, instead using certificates (usually much more secure, anyway).\nNow, you need to make a script, example-script.sh, in your remote host's home directory(make sure to chmod a+x example-script.sh afterward to set it as executable).\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nCURRENT=$(df / | awk '/\\// { print $5}' | sed 's/%//g')\nmail -s 'Disk Space Alert' username@example.com << EOF\nDisk usage is at:  $CURRENT%\nEOF\n\nAnd now, create a script in your local home directory, local-script.sh to run the command later easily(again, make sure to make it executable after).\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nssh -P YOURPORT user@remote.host ./example-script.sh\n\nThis script allows you to run ./local-script.sh from your home directory to run your remote script in just one line. You can then add this as an alias to your .bashrc file so that you can just run local-script or whatever other alias you may want. You can also use the absolute path(/home/your_username/local-script.sh) in crontab to make it run at a specific time every day.\n\nA: Firstly to explain why nothing happens, most likely because of the syntax. Your ssh command is of the form: ssh server, which is when you only want to login, and then manually type some commands interactively. But if you want some command to be run automatically after login, you should be doing : ssh server somecommand, so just having somecommand on the next line will not work.\nWell, if you want a system to both email disk space info whenever you want, and at the same time support scheduled emails, I would recommend a three part system:\n\n\n*\n\n*one script on the server that obtains the disk info and email logic, for example at /home/yourusername/script.sh\n\n*crontab to run the script.sh\n\n*for your arbitrary, on-a-whim requests you can ssh and execute the script\n\n\nscript.sh\nThis is the script you put on the server, for example at /home/yourusername/script.sh.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ns=\"Disk Space Alert: $(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5}')\"\n\nmail -s $s username@example.com\n\n# Feedback\necho $s\n\nI removed the sed because it simply removed % sign but then you were adding it back later, this seems a redundant use of sed so I removed it.\nSecondly, I have condensed the disk usage info to fit just in the subject line, if this doesn't work then of course you can revise it to your original form, but let everyone know either way so we can learn if there were any errors etc\ncrontab\nEdit crontab on your server, for example ssh into your server and then proceed with these commands\n$ crontab -e\n\nYou know the format is\n# m h dom mon dow  command\n\nso for daily every day 8 am\n0 8 * * * /home/yourusername/script.sh\n\nSo as long as you have tested the script already and know it works to send emails, then crontab will run the script and cause the email to be sent at 8 am every day\narbitrary request to get disk info emailed\nYou just ssh but put the script command on the end\nssh -p 1111 server@server.example.com /home/yourusername/script.sh\n\nThis uses ssh syntax ssh server somecommand so it logs in, executes whatever command and returns results to your local standard out.\nBecause it has the feedback line, not only should it email, but you also see the Disk Space Alert: ... message so that you at least get immediate feedback that your script was run or not.\n", "Q: NetBeans not working after update I have been usigng NetBeans 2 years now and have encountered an issue.

This guarantees that Mac is booted first, and since rEFInd was installed in Mac, then it should come up first.\n\nA: OSes sometimes reset the default boot program, particularly if they upgrade their standard boot loaders. There's really no way to prevent this from happening, so you must simply know how to correct the problem when it occurs. In Linux, this is done by using the efibootmgr program. In OS X, it's done via bless. See here for more on efibootmgr.\nIf this juggling is happening every time you reboot, then something is seriously wrong. If Ubuntu is resetting GRUB as the default on every reboot, then personally, I'd remove it -- but I'm not a fan of GRUB (enough so that I forked rEFIt to make rEFInd rather than deal with GRUB). I suppose you could also put a call to efibootmgr in a shutdown script, but that runs the risk of becoming disconnected from reality and causing problems, so I'd be reluctant to do that.\n\nEDIT:\nYes, changing the BootOrder variable (via the -o option to efibootmgr) as you suggest is appropriate. You can delete the OpenSUSE entry with:\nsudo efibootmgr -b 0 -B\n\nThere may be OpenSUSE files installed that you can delete using rm -- probably sudo rm -r /boot/efi/EFI/opensuse from Ubuntu. (These files shouldn't do any harm per se, but they could be confusing or be accidentally re-activated in the future.) You can remove the Ubuntu GRUB in a similar way, although it might be re-installed if/when Ubuntu updates it in the future. Also, keeping it around as a backup method of booting may make sense.\nIf you leave Ubuntu's GRUB installed but don't want to see it in rEFInd's menu, you can use dont_scan_dirs or dont_scan_files in refind.conf (probably /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf from Ubuntu) to hide the GRUB entry.\n", "Q: How to make bootable flash drive on kubuntu So what program or command should I use to create bootable flash drive?\nI used UnetBootin, disk creator and I think they are not working as they should .

For the non-alias connection, you leave it configured for DHCP, but then you configure the alias connection with your static connection. In this way if DHCP is available, technically both connections are active, presumably only the DHCP one really \"works\" the network you are using.  If DHCP isn't available, it self assigns a 169 address and doesn't work, but the static alias does.

I copied a file to an USB drive. (using nautilius) all finished seemingly fine. Only to find out later that the file is corrupt and unusable. \nFile size and everything seems the same though but it can't be opened. \nWhat might have caused that and how to prevent it?\n\nA: There are a lot of possibilities.\nIt could be that the USB drive is failing.  This can happen if it's been used a lot.\nRemoving the USB drive without unmounting it first could also cause data corruption.  To unmount from nautilus, click on the eject button next to the USB drive.  Unmounting ensures that all data has actually been written to the USB disk.\nYou can verify that the file has been copied successfully using md5sum.  To do this, open a terminal and type in\nmd5sum path/to/original.file /media/user/disk/copied.file\n\nwhere path/to/original.file is the file you copied, and /media/user/disk/copied.file is the copy on your USB.

Possible explanations for the above diagnosis:\n\n\n*\n\n*The link partner doesn't support Gigabit Ethernet (or has it disabled for some reason, e. g. to save power).\n\n*The signal-to-noise ratio on the connection cable(s) is too low because they lack proper electro-magnetic shielding. This may lead to the link partners agreeing on a lower link speed to maintain a reliable connection. If this is the case, replace the cable (and any other potential connection equipment like wall plugs) by one with at least CAT5e or CAT6 shielding that isn't broken.\n\n", "Q: Visual indicator for nautilus when browsing remote file system?

I have tried GRUB Customizer but it just does not compare.\nOtherwise, are there any other options for a boot manager that is aesthetically pleasing?\n\nA: I an unfamiliar with BURG, but recommend checking out rEFInd.  It supports multiple OS X, Windows, and Linux installations on the same machine, provides a nice pretty menu, and cures some of the ailments of the now defunct rEFIt project.  It only works on the newer EFI and UEFI hardware, so older (pre-Windows 8) hardware will not support it.  \nHere is a link to the project:\nrEFInd Project Page\n\nA: BURG is now available for Ubuntu 15.10 in Nate Muench's Burg PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:n-muench/burg\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install burg burg-themes\nsudo burg-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-burg\n\nGRUB Customizer can be used to customize Burg/Grub, refer this page.\n", "Q: Cannot boot Ubuntu Live from USB So I cannot boot into my Ubuntu or recovery and I tried to boot into Live Ubuntu 14.04.03 USB, but when I select first priority as USB in BIOS, and reboot system, I always get this message on black screen:\nReboot and Select proper Boot device or insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key.\n\nI tried all 3 USB slots, and when I press a key I get this message over again.\nI'm pretty positive it's good USB.\nUSB is set as first priority to boot:\n\n\nA: Fixed the issue by creating USB using Startup Disk Creator\n", "Q: How to remap keyboard permanently - Letters, not CapsLock or Num Lk This is what i do \n\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 135 = g\"\n\nbut i lost it everytime i shutdown/restart my computer. I use ubuntu 14.04. Please someone can help me to make this change be permanent?\nThanks!\n\nA: You may potentially wish to put this into /etc/rc.local.  rc.local runs during the boot process, specifically at the end of the boot process.  It permits you to run certain commands at boot, but before you login.\nThis may be one option for making these changes.  However, note that this isn't a permanent solution later - if /etc/rc.local is changed or overwritten, you will have to put this back into /etc/rc.local of your own accord.\nYou will need superuser to edit this.  Either sudo nano /etc/rc.local for editing it in a command line, or pkexec gedit /etc/rc.local to edit it from the GUI program gedit.\n\nCaveats:\nYou must make sure to keep exit 0; at the end of rc.local!  This is to ensure that it 'exits' with a 'no failure' code, otherwise you could have other tiny but annoying issues crop up during the boot process (such as errors in dmesg or otherwise indicating you had a problem during boot).\n\nA: For those with the same problem, here's one solution:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/388424/459031\nThanks!\n", "Q: How to handle USB Drive mounting error I have a Monster Digital Overdrive USB SSD 128GB hard drive.

So this is going to sound pretty foolish, but I'm just trying to be safe.  In the link below, it says that the terminal will require us to enter our name and email.  Do we enter in our actual name (if so, our full name/with or without spaces/what formatting?) and our actual email, or simply continue to enter in the scripts:\ngit config --get user.name\ngit config --get user.email \n\nas the site tells us?\nHere is the link to the site I am referring to: \nhttp://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/configure_git\n\nA: The correct formating is like this :\ngit config --get user.email \"johndoe@company.com\"\ngit config --get user.name \"John Doe\"\n\n\nA: You enter whatever your want. If you don't want to enter your actual full name, you can use a pseudonym and a fake email.\nThose information are useful, for example, if you intent to contribute to project using git. Configuring your full name and email is a way to show in a project who you are and what you have contributed to the project.\n\nThe full command are the following :\ngit config --global user.name \"Jacques Chirac\"\ngit config --global user.email \"chirac@example.com\"\n\n(You can put spaces and whatever formatting you want/need)\n\nA: \nThis answer is an addendum to the other answers, and although it answers the commands question like the other answers, it has additional information added which was not touched on in other answers.\n\nAs stated in other answers, the full commands to use are in the following format:\ngit config --global user.email \"bob@bob-smith-industries.net\"\ngit config --global user.name \"Bob Smith\"\n\nAs to what to put here specifically, that's up to you.  Keep in mind, however, where the git project resides.  If the Git project resides on GitHub, BitBucket, or a private GitLab instance, then in order for your commits there to tie to your username, your user.email configuration option should match an email address of which you have registered on those sites.\nIf the repository owner wants you to be using a specific name and address for yourself, then you may also wish to set this here as well.\nNote that this affects every single git repository you use.

I know how to make simple versions, that can only change file names on a case by case basis but can't do it en mass. For example, I can create a script to remove only @ from file names, but I don't know how to include folders/directories nor do I know how to include all the other characters in this one script.\nIdeally the script would run the first time and produce a file using echo with all the changes that need to be made including the full path and then the changed path. The script would then either need to be modified slightly to use mv instead, or it could refer to the file created using echo and perform all the necessary changes using it...\nAny and all help would be appreciated as this is really rather important and I lack the skills at this point in time to make this myself...\nA final note, I can't use the #rename command. It breaks our IT policy.\nEDIT\nI'm unable to use any version of rename, the head of my IT dept. has forbade it. I'm sure he has his reasons, but I can't say that I'm privy to them. The rename command is not available on our servers at all.\nThis means I have to use pure bash to perform the operation.\nThere aren't any additional requirements. Basically I need to be able to run a script to output all the changes that will be made to a file, before anything is changed. This will allow us to review the results and make sure there are no stuff-ups. After that, we want to run (the same script or a different one) it to actually make the changes. \nAll I need is stated above, so anything marked \"MAKE -\" needs to become a hyphen and anything marked \"REMOVE\" needs to just go away. \nIf there's anything else, please ask.

Just wondering why there is no option in Ubuntu's desktop environment to open a program, for example Nautilus, as root. I know that I can accomplish this in the terminal, but wouldn't it benefit the Ubuntu's usability to allow this to be done by simply right clicking on a program?\n\nA: Because that is not the intended usage of Nautilus manager.  It is intended to manage user related files. Like your documents. \nBecause we do not use a \"root\" account and editing files with your admin account (aka. \"sudo\") will change the permissions and then break stuff. Famous files are .xsession-errors and .XAuthority in your home. If those change into anything else than what they currently are (rw- --- --- and owned by $USER:$USER) you can no longer log into the desktop. \nEditing files you need to edit as a admin you should really do from command line. The occasional gksudo nautilus or even gksudo gedit might be useful but should not become common. It will at some point break stuff and that almost always happens when you least expect it and at the worst time.\n\nA: No.\nRunning anything as root is dangerous for your entire system and therefore something that should only be done by experienced administrators. If that was available as simple right-click option everywhere, you can imagine how many applications would be run as root without necessity. That would be a security problem (malware or attacked/infected webbrowsers with root privileges sounds not like a good idea) and let many users accidentally destroy their installation (login-loops are probably the most common consequence of bad sudo usage).\nTherefore the small extra effort to run an application as root protects careless users from too quickly doing something they might regret without having/taking time to think about it again.\nOther than that, most tools that are needed by \"simple computer owners\" to administrate their machine like the System Settings or GParted automatically ask for the (gk)sudo password when needed.\nBut the terminal is not required to run an application (only if it really needs it!) as root. You may just use the Unity HUD to execute a single command. Open it by pressing Alt+F2, then enter gksudo APPLICATION-NAME and hit Enter/Return. \nYou could even add \"Run as root...\" to the right-click menu of a launcher if you want. But that requires modifying its .desktop file and is something I'm not going to describe here.\n", "Q: Is there a simple way to add an url as launcher on Ubuntu Touch?

But you can also let the Dash's application lens (Super+A) filter the shown items by categories, like to only show games:\n\nOr if you don't like that at all, switch to e.g. Xubuntu, which uses another desktop environment called XFCE that is more similar to what you know from Windows (start menu etc.) and is also more lightweight.\nYou can simply add that DE by installing the package xubuntu-desktop and then select which one to use on every login.\n\nA: Frankly, I do not understand why would Ubuntu need to cater to the Windows users needs. You don't see Apple doing that, do you ? Windows and Ubuntu are different systems, hence will have different behavior and different organization. I understand people may be spoiled beings, but when you switch systems be prepared to learn a little bit; or in other words: \"When in Rome, try to pick up some Italian, don't expect people to speak English\".\nAs for the programs, the core of the question. Byte commander has already provided you with the shortcut Super A, which works well for the 90% of applications that have a .desktop file in the /usr/share/applications folder ( which by the way, has nothing to do with Ubuntu, it's up to developers to properly package their software and to include that as one of the things ). You can refer to the following question that has been asked on AU long time ago: What is the equivalent to the Windows “Program Files” folder? (Where do things go when I install them?)\nIf you absolutely despise Unity's Dash, remember that you are on Linux ! There is plenty of alternatives.

The specific number is entirely application-specific,\n  and is used to hint as to what exactly went wrong.  \n  \n\nI should have read man diff right to the end where the convention used by the developers is clear.\n\nA: man diff tells us  \nEXIT STATUS\n   The following exit values shall be returned:\n\n    0     No differences were found.\n\n    1     Differences were found.\n\n   >1     An error occurred.\n\nYour calling the exit values \"success\" and \"failure\" is a self-limiting choice.Programs have a whole 8 bits for exit status, values from 0 to 255. \n\nA: From man diff:\n\nExit status is 0  if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.\n\nI freely admit this might not be completely standard but exit codes are more what you'd call \"guidelines\" than actual rules.\n\nIn this case, deviating from the standard allows you to easily run diff in scripts.\ndiff a b && echo \"no difference\" || echo \"differences!\"\n\nThis is similar to grep which will exit 0 is something is found, and 1 if something isn't found. I can't explain the orientation between 0 and 1 for diff. I assume they went with C-standard boolean outcomes.\nIt doesn't really matter. It's just an arbitrary number.\n", "Q: Proprietary Nvidia Driver: Broken boot screen When I first booted Ubuntu Studio, the Logo with the spinning bars was shown correctly upon startup. Ever since I installed the proprietary Nvidia driver, the splash screen is broken and I have not yet found a way to restore it.\nWhen I start my computer, I see the BIOS screen, then it goes black, I see a small, animated Ubuntu Studio Logo inside a grey square and the rest of the screen is black, then there briefly is a bar with random artifacts shown at the top of the screen and then the desktop starts.  \nI have read other questions regarding issues with the splash screen when using Nvidia's proprietary drivers, however none of these solutions worked. So far, I have tried:\nFinding out the supported grub resolutions with hwinfo.\nsudo apt-get install v86d hwinfo\nsudo hwinfo --framebuffer\n\nThen uncommenting and setting the highest resolution in the grub configuration file (in my case 1280x1024):\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1280x1024\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\nAdding the bit-depth (x24/x16) after the resolution did nothing and is apparently not valid.\nThen I found another solution suggesting to edit the following line in the same file:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset video=uvesafb:mode_option=1280x1024-16,mtrr=3,scroll=ywrap\"\n\nAnd also add the code:\nuvesafb mode_option=1280x1024-16 mtrr=3 scroll=ywrap\n\nTo the file /etc/initramfs-tools/modules. Unfortunately this also resulted in no change at all.\nOf course, I always updated grub and initramfs after every change by executing the following after every file update:\nsudo update-grub2\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nI am not sure what else to try now. Are there any more solutions for this problem? Or would it be possible to just install another splash screen from scratch (it does not have to be the Ubuntu Studio splash screen for me or look fancy at all, but at least not broken).\nBy the way, I am currently using Ubuntu Studio 15.10 with an Nvidia Quadro 5000 GPU and the proprietary 304.128 legacy driver, which I have to use because of performance problems of the newest driver with Compton. I had the newest driver installed before and the problem exsisted as well, the driver change made no difference, either. Nouveau drivers are no alternative for me, unfortunately.\n\nA: After changing GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep to GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text and executing sudo update-grub, the early part of the boot process looks ok on my laptop until video driver is loaded.\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep basically lets grub meddle with kernel's screen drawing, so kernel cannot display characters well in the early part of the boot process on some machines.\nBut, I still need to insert radeon kernel module into initramfs to prevent plymouth from being broken. You might have to insert proprietary nvidia driver into initramfs or experiment with /etc/default/grub to prevent boot splash from being broken.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get Commodore 128's Basic v7 emulation to work in Ubuntu? I have installed VICE and it seems to work nicely as far as running Commodore 64 games and programs, and I have not tried testing to see if the basic v4.0 is functional in itself, but any searches for suggestions to make use of Commodore 128 features only point to installing or configuring C64 functionality.

Alas, AltF12 is a very bad default choice in Linux, as this key combination is frequently taken by window managers! Hence, invoking a hard reset via this key combination may not work, respectively may not have the desired effect! \nSo should it fail for you too, then please invoke the hard reset via drop-down menu: File -> Reset -> Hard. This is guaranteed to work no matter what.\n\nA: You can also use the GRAPHIC command rather than a key combination:\nGRAPHIC 0\nswitches into 40 column mode\nGRAPHIC 5\nswitches into 80 column mode\nI wholeheartedly agree with @syntaxerror about F7 and ALT+F12 being a really bad choice for anything other than PC systems. I have the same issue on my Mac, on which the F-keys are actually mapped to the original Commodore F-keys (so F7 simply displays the LIST command, rather than executing the host system's F7 key).

You will want the 64 bit version which can be downloaded here.\nThat download is for the 15.10 release which has a shorter support time-frame. So, your post indicates that you're new to Linux or, at least, to Lubuntu. Because of this, I'm going to actually suggest that you download the LTS (Long Term Stable) version. Again, your CPU is 64 bit so you will want to download the 64 bit version. For the sake of consistency, I strongly recommend that you do go ahead and use the LTS version until you're used to it and then you can decide if you want to use something a little more bleeding edge.\n\n*\n\n*You will want to format your USB drive. This means that you'll loose any information that you already have on that drive so be sure to back that information up. You will want to format the drive in FAT32. Using Windows you can just insert the drive, open Windows Explorer, right click on it, and select to format the drive.\n\n\n*Download the .ISO file from the site linked above to your current PC. Once you have downloaded the .ISO from the site then you will want to copy the image to a USB drive. Now, this is not really a direct copy, you don't just drag and drop it there. Instead, you need to use the .ISO (an image file) and some special software to do this. I recommend that you use unetbootin for this. It is fairly simply and does a good job.\n\n\n*Then you'll boot the computer and change the boot order to boot to USB drive first. On the Acer Aspire One models this means that you press the DEL key during boot. In those settings you can select to boot to USB as the first order of boot.\n\n\n*Then, you're on the way. This page gives a nice rundown of how to do the actual installation process. If you have any specific questions then we can probably help with those.\nSome final notes:\n\n*\n\n*Your netbook is a bit dated now. There's not a whole lot of RAM and the CPU is woefully underpowered. Compared to your current OS, it will probably run much better than before. I've installed Lubuntu on a few netbooks (specifically from Acer) in the past and found the performance to be acceptable but one needs to keep in mind what the computer is capable of. You won't be running YouTube videos in full screen and in high definition. You won't be running a bunch of applications at one time. You won't be opening a few dozen tabs.\n\n\n*However, if you just want to browse the web, maybe read something on the go, or if you want to check email and maybe do some quick note taking then it's absolutely fine. I've had nary a hardware issue so there should be no difficulty in those regards. I've not done so in a while but I am presuming that the hardware support is the same as it has always been.\n\n\n*I should also add that, given the nature of the beast, I'd not bother with trying to dual-boot the OS. You can, if you want, but Windows 7 (the OS that the netbook came with) is no longer in mainstream support, support ended January 13, 2015 and it will be EOL (End Of Life) in 2020 - so you'll get no new updates except for security updates. You'll get no new features. Dual booting is probably not required for you - it's not likely that you're using your netbook to do any serious gaming as it is. Unless you have a very compelling reason then I'd just recommend formatting it entirely and installing Linux in its default mode.\n\n\n*It is easier to install and make sure that it is configured properly when it is the only Operating System on the computer but it will also give you motivation to learn about Ubuntu and Linux. Dual booting can be done but, unless you have some very specific application that you can't live without, Linux will almost certainly accomplish anything you'd want to do on netbook hardware.\n\nA: I wouldn't expect a default Ubuntu installation (using the Unity desktop) to work fluently on this setup; I've experienced the Unity desktop to be eating far too much CPU and RAM to run on such limited resources. Also, GNOME 3 would most likely struggle, too, and so would KDE, but as far as I have experienced, to a much lesser extent.\nFor this setup, I'd go with one of the desktops with less impact on CPU load and memory usage, such as Xfce (used in Xubuntu) or LXDE (used in Lubuntu):\n\nThe Xfce desktop in Xubuntu 14.04.\n\nThe LXDE desktop used in Lubuntu 14.04.\nI assume both of them to work pretty well on your hardware, so it's up to you which to choose (as it wasn't from the beginning...). To find out which you like better, you can put both systems on a USB stick, and boot directly off it. Please note that in this scenario the fact that the whole OS is running off an USB disk can be a real bottleneck (but needn't be, as I've impressively learned). So you may experience a slightly less fluent system from the USB stick.\nYou can get the boot images from here:\nXubuntu\nLubuntu\nPlease choose the image fit for your system architecture. If you're using an UEFI-based computer, best use a 64bit image, as I've experienced Linux to work not as ideally with 32bit UEFI systems. For an older PC, you may want to choose a 32bit image.\nFor installation, please refer to this extensive guide at the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki.\n", "Q: installation of sshd in Ubuntu 14.04 I am trying to install sshd on my Ubuntu system but I am unable to do so.

Disabling a firewall remotely (without using ssh to get into the console) defeats the purpose of the firewall! \nI'm afraid you are going to have to use Amazon's EC2 control panel to get into it.

When you create a program in a compiled language, such as C, you use compiler that translates human-readable code into machine-level code. Decompiler does the opposite. Here's a small list of C decompilers, from  stackoverflow question. \nI don't have experience with decompilers , but my guess is that if a program is non-open source, you wouldn't be able to decompile it. \nWith open-source apps , it's easier - you can use apt-get source package-name or just look up an app on git-hub\n\nA: You cant, .exe are executable binaries for windows, there's no code, just machine instructions.\nIf you use Linux or Mac you can easily find the raw sources in the temp src folder of your package manager (brew, yum, apt-get...), Unix systems downloads the sources and (sometimes) builds it on your own machine\n", "Q: MSI GT80 turn on numpad? \nMy laptop (MSI GT80) has a touchpad that becomes the numpad when you press the \"num lock\" button at the top-left of the touchpad. It works on Windows 8.1 & Win 10, but no on Ubuntu. The touchpad itself works, but I can't switch between touchpad and numpad. Does anyone know how this might be achieved?\nThanks in advance!\nRunning Ubuntu 15.10 x64 w/ Unity 7.3.2, kernel 4.3.2.\n\nA: This would be because the gt80's touchpad is software based, and not hardware based. You could install wine, and then install the software for the touchpad (probably a .MSI file, you'd have to find it), and see if it works then. Worth a try\n", "Q: PROBLEM - \"update - dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\". Plus - boot 0 bytes I am a newbie at wits end.

You need to reboot so you are running the latest one, then you can remove an older one to free up some space with sudo dpkg -r linux-image-3.16.0-48-generic, then run sudo apt-get install -f to finish installing the half installed one, and finally sudo apt-get autoremove to clean up all of the older ones.\n", "Q: Why does the Slack app think I'm British? Firefox has stopped insisting that there's a \"u\" in \"neighbour\", though it periodically reverts to thinking I'm British. But the Slack app can't be told otherwise. Is there some kind of system-wide setting I should be using? \nI'm using the official beta. \nThis question: How to use American English spelling dictionary in Firefox? seems to suggest that I should remove the myspell-en-au myspell-en-gb myspell-en-za packages which I'm happy to do but I don't see myspell-en-us installed at all and at least Firefox definitely has English (United States)\nWhen I do cat /etc/default/locale it definitely knows I'm American: LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nSo is this an issue with Slack? Or is there a setting elsewhere that I should be looking at?\n\nA: This turned out to be a Slack bug. I addressed it by removing myspell-en_AU but the real fix is for Slack to fix their code. They're working on that. \n\nA: The hunspell-en-us package does not include myspell symlinks like other hunspell-* packages do. Possibly this is a bug.\nI built the package in my PPA with the missing symlinks.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~gunnarhj/+archive/ubuntu/misc\nTo figure out if this explains it, I suggest that you install hunspell-en-us from my PPA.\n\nA: This is a bug in Slack, which their support confirmed to me in an email exchange. If you want U.S. English checks in Slack, then go to your OS language preferences (on OSX, this is under System Preferences->Keyboard->Text->Spelling), disable all languages except U.S. English, and Slack will use that dictionary. Specifying more than one dictionary makes Slack fall back to English (UK), even if that isn't among the selected languages.\nObviously, you are going to lose spelling support for any other languages in all other Applications, so if you write a lot of Emails in Spanish or French, this may no be a solution that works for you. Equally, if you use more than one language in Slack, you have to pick one to get spelling support for, and disable spell-check support on any teams where you don't use English.\nIn other words: All of these are ill-fitting workarounds, and the problem needs to be fixed by Slack's engineers.\n", "Q: Xubuntu doesn't always connect wirelessly Sometimes when I boot up Xubuntu 15.10, I can't connect to my wireless network. Sometimes I can view other networks that are in range and sometimes I can't, but in these instances I can't connect to my own Wi-Fi. Restarting Xubuntu usually does the trick, but sometimes I have to restart two or three times for it to work. How can I fix this so that my computer connects automatically every time I boot?\nI have XUbuntu 15.10 64-bit installed on a \n Lenovo Z50-70 Laptop.\nSpecs:\n  Atheros AR9565 On-board wireless adapter\n Intel Core i7-4510U\n 8GB DDR3 RAM\n 1TB HDD\nAs a related issue, most of the time when I boot up and I can connect to Wi-Fi, Dropbox doesn't sync and my VPN program (VPN Unlimited) won't automatically log me in.\n\nA: I also noticed this in recent Ubuntu releases (15.04 notably).

But I've been having some problems with my lenovo thinkpad recently.\nThis suddenly happened this morning and now I can't get it back to normal.\nFor example, when I press the left shift button and 2, It comes up as @, for an email address instead of a \" for an open speech marks. The \" is where the @ should be instead. \nAlso, the ~ is where the | is. I've tried searching around the internet and it appears that I might have accidentally activated Numlock. I've tired to look up how to disable it,but no luck.\nI have ubuntu 14.04, please put your criticism on how stupid I am down below, it's just I'm a beginner at this kind of stuff. \n\nA: I assume you somehow managed to change the keyboard settings. There are several methods to correct this depending on which desktop you use. I'll explain you the method involving the terminal (that's the black screen with white characters). So:Open a terminal (or konsole, depending on your desktop flavor). Then type this command in the terminalsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration and then press the enter key.\nYou'll be asked a few questions and be sure to choose the applicable answers. Most likely your keyboard is a generic type with a US layout. After answering the questions please restart the computer and then the keyboard should work correctly.\n", "Q: Why does`sudo su -` still try to execute terminator?

How can I debug this problem ?\n\nA: You have /usr/bin/terminator set as the default shell for root (see comments). You can change it back to whatever shell you like with the following command:\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash root\n\nShould sudo not work either, you can follow this procedure to fix it (assuming you are using GRUB):\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot\n\n*If the boot menu doesn't show up automatically, reboot and repeatedly hit ↑ Shift until it appears.\n\n*In the boot menu, press e to edit the entry.\n\n*Navigate to the end of the line similar to\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-... quiet splash\n\n\n*Replace quiet splash by init=/bin/bash and hit Ctrl+X to boot the modified entry.

Your system is more or less broken. In what ways did the previous owner abuse this system?\nYou can try to find out what the default ownerships and permissions are, and set them manually; there is no way to reset all ownerships and permissions automatically. I wish you the all the fun in the world would you choose to do so.\nAlternatively, reinstall the system. Only by doing so you can be sure that any digital crimes committed to this computer by the previous owner are rooted out. That way, you'll have a clean, recent and properly owned system.

It is not in the resolutions list in the display settings. I really searched my problem but I could not solve. My monitor's resolution is 1680x1050 (16:10) but there is other 16:10 resolution in the list too.\nAlso I cannot see the edge areas of display, they are like outside of my monitor. But when I changed display from \"Full\" to \"16x9\" from monitor's own settings I could see the bottom and top with 1280x1024 setting. If I change this resolution (for example 1280x720) bottom and top edge goes outside slightly. But after using following code I could see right edges if I move my mouse to edge. I mean display moves to right. (Actually a value like 1350x1024 works too.

Set a value to match your display (in my case 43 would fit)\n8/ that's done\n\nA: A workaround when xrandr fails consists in forcing a resolution from the GRUB menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your computer and hit Esc in order to have access to the GRUB menu, then press C to go to the command line.\n\n*At the command line, type vbeinfo and hit Enter. You'll get a list of supported resolution modes. Take note of the highest one, which will be your \"desired mode\" (for instance: 1280x768x32, which means 1280x768 resolution and 32-bit color depth). Also take note of the one you wish as fallback mode (for instance: 800x600x4), then hit Esc to return to the GRUB menu, select the option that boots your Linux distribution (it's usually the first/top option) and hit Enter.\n\n*After your login to the GUI (graphical user interface), start the shell terminal and execute sudo nano /etc/default/grub (if your system doesn't have the Nano text editor, just execute sudo apt-get install nano -y and afterwards execute sudo nano /etc/default/grub again), then replace the #GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480 code by the one below (lines starting with # are interpreted as comments, thus removing the # character makes such lines become parameters that are interpreted by GRUB). Notice that this is just an example, but the first resolution and color depth (to the left) must be the highest mode you saw on the list generated by vbeinfo and the second one must be the \"fallback mode\" you picked from the same list:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768x32,800x600x4,auto\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\n\n*Once the code is modified like the above example, use the Ctrl O key combo (press the O key while holding the Ctrl key) in order to save the file, then use the Ctrl X key combo in order to exit Nano. Subsequently, execute sudo update-grub (in order to apply these changes to the GRUB config file) and then restart your system (so the changes will take effect).\n\n\nIf KMS (kernel mode setting) works, GRUB will ask the Linux kernel to initialize the display driver following the hierarchy you previously defined.\n", "Q: Help needed after Ubuntu 14.04 trial I wanted to try Ubuntu before I install it on my windows laptop Asus N550. So I downloaded the 14.04LTS version and loaded it on a bootable USB thumb drive. Everything went smoothly and I liked the experience a lot. However once I restarted the laptop to switch to windows I was faced with a blue screen with an error 0xc0000225 saying I cannot access my OS drive. I went back to Ubuntu and it works fine.\nThe suggested fix is to load the recovery disc but I do not have one - and neither the recovery partition on HDD- since I replaced it long time ago with SSD. I tried using a bootable USB with windows and I tried the available tools but with no success. One thing I noticed is that these tools asked me to select a system which is always win 8.1 which was my original OS before I upgraded to win 10.\nPlease I need help as this is my primary device and I need it to lunch windows ASAP. \n\nA: Solved. I tinkered more in the windows setup and found the problem(s) preventing successful windows repair tools. \nAnyway it still bothers me that a simple trial of Ubuntu did all this mess. I still want to load Ubuntu on the laptop maybe in a permanent manner next time around.\nCheers.\n", "Q: Script to empty trash I've created a script to empty my trash. I want to be able to execute it without having to use the terminal. Is there anyway I could do this?\n\nA: A nice way to execute scripts by double clicking them is to make a .desktop file, which is essentially a shortcut. Aside from scripts, it can execute pretty much any executable, including .jar. Here's how to make one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file and name it <program name>.desktop\n\n*Open it with GEdit and paste this text in:  \n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=<whatever you want the file name to be>\nComment=<description of program>\nExec=</path/to/script>\nIcon=</path/to/optional/icon.png>\n\n\n*Edit the Name, Comment, Exec, and Icon fields to what you want. Having an Icon is optional and you can simply remove that line if you don't want to have one. Make sure to delete the surrounding <>.\n\n*Save the file and then go into its properties.\n\n*Go to Permissions and mark it as executable.\nYou should now be able to double click this file and it will execute your script. If you don't want a terminal window to be shown, add Terminal=false to the file. You can now add this file to the launcher for easy access, if you like. If you want to move your script, you'll have to update the Exec path in the .desktop file.\nAny problems, just comment.\n---Update---\nThanks to @kos, I now know the solution to your problem. Instead of having sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*, you want just rm -rf ~/.local/share/Trash/*. Since ~/.local/share/Trash is owned by you, you can do anything from your user account to edit it without sudo. After testing the non-sudo command out, I can confirm that it works.\n", "Q: Boot folder is almost full, how to give it more space? My boot folder or whatever it is dev/sda1/boot only has about 300mb of memory and it's about full. I'm not sure why it has so little memory.

Is there a way I can move memory to the boot folder so it has plenty of room for future updates etc etc?\n\nA: I would first go to it and try to free up some space, if that doesnt fix it try to boot into live USB and resize the partition, note you should be careful not to damage all others.\n", "Q: Where to Download Special Ubuntu Images Designed for Pre-installed Systems (OEM)? Background\nMy Lenovo X250 is arriving in two weeks, which according to Ubuntu Certified Hardware will work well only with \"a special image of Ubuntu pre-installed by the manufacturer.\"\nThis Linux systems seller points out that the X250 has \"Excellent\" compatibility to the Linux OSes they install. On the other hand, a quick search on Google or Ask Ubuntu shows that a standard image of Ubuntu on the X250 is rife with hardware problems.\nUbuntu Certified Hardware acknowledges this for the X250: \"Standard images of Ubuntu may not work at all on the system or may not work well.\" This certification page for the X240s clearly shows the difference between an Ubuntu standard image installation and the one that comes pre-installed by the manufacturer. Hardware seems to work fully on the OEM version.\nQuestion\nAny idea where we may access or download these \"special images of Ubuntu\"?\n(Hopefully not only for the X250, but also for the other systems out there.)\n\nA: I have mostly ignored this certification programme until now and I currently don't know who actually contributes to this team, maintains the entries and how this certification is done.\nI just clicked the link let us know link which leads to Ubuntu-Certification and has a few interesting links\n\n*\n\n*How do I install drivers on my system?\nAlmost no surprises here if you have been around in Linux for some time.\n\nOn Ubuntu, most of the drivers like touchpad, webcam, Ethernet card...etc are already included in the kernel, they should be working as expected when you have the latest Ubuntu installed. The only driver you might need to install is for the AMD / NVIDIA video card and the Broadcom wireless controller\n…\nTo install the proprietary drivers for the aforementioned video / wireless card, please:\n\n*\n\n*Connect to the Internet.\n\n*Run a system update with the \"Update Manager\" from the dash to update the software list.\n\n*Open \"Additional Drivers\" from the dash and install the proprietary driver with it\n\n…\nDriver packages for Dell: …\n\n\n\n*What's the difference between Certified (Pre-Installed) and Certified?\n\nCertified (Pre-Installed only) means that a system was tested using the exact same testing tools, however the OS may have been modified to fix issues that are commonly found when putting Linux on brand new hardware. These certifications work a little differently, and ONLY apply to the custom Ubuntu ISO image that was provided to the OEM for pre-installation on computer systems that are sold around the world.\nIn a nutshell, it works like this:\nThe OEM sends Canonical a new system.\nCanonical then works on the system and gets it running to an accepted level with Ubuntu. This could mean custom drivers, kernel patches or other work.\nCanonical then gives the OEM a custom ISO image that is used to pre-install Ubuntu onto these new systems.\n…\nAlso, at current time, Canonical can not provide those OEM images to the public.\nThe goal is to get all fixes that make these custom ISOs work into stock Ubuntu via the normal Ubuntu development cycle.\n\nSo all improvements towards Linux hardware compatibility are intended to land sooner or later in Ubuntu (and upstream), no proprietary \"Ubuntu-only\" bits. Once you identified which issues were fixed, if any, you could safely install the most up to date release of Ubuntu yourself and no longer depend on the OEM or scarce \"certification\" information.\nMy advice\nCompare a normal installation that you would do on this machine with another hard drive to the pre-installed one. Look at which packages are installed in which version (dpkg -l) and what files are in the filesystem (hash all files and compare them, look at configuration files and scripts in a diff viewer like meld or use the terminal).\nThis is what I would do with an untrusted system that I did not install myself and a comparable known to be good state.\nA word of criticism\nI fail to see how the seemingly intransparent nature benefits consumers interested in certified or \"Ubuntu Edition\" computers.\nInstead of being free to install what ever Linux distro or release I choose, there is a special image that I don't have access to (no reason given why) and uncertainty of what to do in case the system becomes unstable or corrupted. The last thing I want to do is looking at the wasteland of an OEM support site (I'm just looking at the Lenovo site and I only see RHEL/SUSE) or explain my issue to a support agent who never installed an OS. To the uninitiated it gives the impression that there is a secret list of bugs and it's never revealed when they were solved.\nOne also has to probably pay extra for the special edition when any other model of the series or some other hardware would do too for either less or getting more capable hardware. It spells FUD to me the same way as all the other low information marketing campaigns in tech do (and it shouldn't be that way, but about trust).\nRelated\n\n*\n\n*Why is System76 not mentioned on the Ubuntu certified hardware partners page?\n\nA: I (yesterday) bought a Dell Latitude 5480 and it came with a pre-installed Ubuntu.\nDuring the installation and afterwards, I could create a recovery Image that could restore to the factory shipped state. See screencap below.\nThis isn't a \"pure\" solution and don't even know if it even works (whether all the drivers would be installed correctly).\n\n", "Q: Can't get my W7/Ubuntu dual boot to reboot I generally don't like to result to asking for help, but guys, I am completely lost. I had a dual boot system working great until I ran \napt-get do-release-upgrade\n\nIt progressed fine, I restarted and instead of GRUB, I was greeted with a black screen and a blinking underscore. I popped in a live USB to do a boot-repair but I can't get the thing to boot to it. I have tried playing with secure boot in BIOS, setting boot priorities, clearing CMOS then setting boot priorities all to no avail. I get the Windows prompt \"loading operating system...\" with an underscore with all of them.\nMy last ditch effort was removing EVERYTHING. HDDs, ethernet cable, DVD drive, and only booting with my display, computer, and Live USB. I still got the Windows \"loading operating system...\" prompt. My head is spinning, I can't figure out what to do. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You need to repair your MBR, when messing with Grub, or not properly installing it, or trying to use a beta version you will encounter the black screen as there is no boot loader to choose from. Do the following with a Windows repair disc or bootable USB:\n\n\nWhen you insert the Windows installation media choose \"Repair my computer>Troubleshoot>Advanced>Command prompt\". Run the following command:\n\n\nbootrec.exe /fixmbr\n\nThis will fix the Windows boot loader so Windows boots right up after restarting.\nI would suggest starting over with Ubuntu if you can to properly install it. Get booted up into the installer, remove the old partitions (not the Windows ones), and then re-creating them again. This would ensure a fresh install of Ubuntu\nNOTE** Running the fixmbr option will fix the normal windows bootloader. You will no longer have the option to get into linux, or see the grub menu. This is the fix I know of.\n", "Q: Difference between \"pip install sompackage and python pip install somepackage\" commands I had to install Sphinx on Ubuntu for use with python (django) and I came across this two commands: pip install Sphinx, and then I saw this too python -m pip install Sphinx. \nAre there any difference as to where Sphinx will be installed as I want to be able to use Sphinx globally ?\n\nA: /usr/bin/pip is just a Python script that invokes the pip module using the load_entry_point function. Therefore, the following are (mostly) equivalent:\npython -m pip ...\npip ...\n\nSee What's the difference between pip install and python -m pip install? on Stack Overflow for details.\n\nA: As long as you don't have multiple versions of python installed, these two commands do the same. You can test this by doing \npip list and python -m pip list it should output the same packages. \nIf you do have multiple versions installed, either keep the preferred one on you path or call it directly with its absolute path i.e. /usr/bin/python\n", "Q: SSH into a machine and then launch an interactive command line program I would like to actually ssh into a machine (not remotely execute a command like ssh -i key.pem user@host 'bash -s' < script.sh) and then once that is complete run a command to launch an interactive command line program on the remote machine. Any ideas? Note all of this is done in a script and the end result should be a interactive command line program running within the shell on the remote host.\nSo far I have tried in Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 14.04\nimport os\nos.system(\"xterm -e ssh -tt -i key.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@ip_address yRouter/src/yrouter --interactive=1 user\")\n\nBut the xterm session closes immediately after. The \"yrouter\" is the executable on the remote machine and --interactive=1 user are its arguments.\nTo clarify: the result after running the Python code above should be an xterm (or any terminal window) open, already sshed into the remote host AND have the interactive command line program yrouter running. \n\nA: If you pass a command in the arguments ssh runs non-interactively;\n$ ssh -t user@localhost echo foo\nuser@localhost's password: \nfoo\nConnection to localhost closed.\n\nA solution is to replace the non-interactive shell with an interactive shell in the command passed to ssh:\n$ ssh -t user@localhost 'echo foo; exec zsh'\nuser@localhost's password: \nfoo\n% \n\nIn your case, to replace the non-interactive shell e.g. with an interactive Bash instance:\nimport os\nos.system(\"xterm -e ssh -tt -i key.pem -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@ip_address 'yRouter/src/yrouter --interactive=1 user; exec bash'\")\n\n", "Q: Disable mouse acceleration in Ubuntu 15.10 I did a few quick google searches, and it looks like the most recent discussion about this was back in 2012. \nHow might I go about disabling mouse acceleration in Ubuntu 15.10?

I never selected Spanish as a main language under \"Language support\", so I uninstalled Spanish language and then made sure to have English only, I rebooted the system many times and now the interface is in both languages... part of the menu of the interface is in English and Spanish, all mixed... very strange.\nI was trying to get a screenshot from the menu but it seems this option doesn't work when the menu is displayed.\nSo what I'm asking is... How can I have only English displayed as it used to be?\nBy the way, I'm a beginner user in Ubuntu, I hope you guys could help me.\nThank you for reading.\n\nA: I'd suggest that you open Language Support again and reinstall Spanish.

Can I just copy the files and directories within it, let's say with my file manager, or cp, or do I have to use some tool like dd.  Also, does it matter what filesystem I put my backup on?  If I do it the first way, using thunar or cp, do I have to put it on a FAT32 filesystem?  \nThanks.  \n\nA: Kos's answer is a good one. I want to bring up one more point, though: If you back up the ESP to a FAT partition on a USB flash drive, you may be able to boot using the backup in an emergency. That is, suppose that the ESP is accidentally trashed without your knowledge and you shut down the computer. When you power it up, the computer will no longer boot. If you plug in your backup, though, you may be able to boot from it, without using any other emergency recovery tools, and then copy the backup back to the ESP. For this to work, though, you'll need one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*A fallback boot loader -- The filename EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi (or equivalent for other architectures) on a FAT partition is the fallback filename, which the firmware uses if no other NVRAM-specified option works, or when booting from removable media. Some OSes (like Windows) automatically put a copy of their boot loaders under this name, in addition to their regular name. Ubuntu doesn't do this, but you can create such a copy easily enough -- just copy the EFI/ubuntu directory (on the ESP or on your backup) to EFI/BOOT and then rename shimx64.efi (or grubx64.efi, if shimx64.efi is absent) in the EFI/BOOT directory to bootx64.efi.\n\n*Firmware support for booting from an arbitrary file -- Some EFIs provide a way for you to boot from an arbitrary file. You pick a \"boot from file\" option in the firmware setup utility or boot manager, whereupon the EFI shows you a file-selection tool. You use that tool to browse to the boot loader you want to use -- EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi (for Secure Boot support) or EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi in this case.\n\n\nYou can set up your backup with a fallback boot loader filename yourself, so the first approach will work on any EFI-based computer. The second depends on the features provided by the manufacturer, though, so you should check to see if this feature is available before you rely on it. Either way, testing your ability to boot in this way may be worth doing.\nIf your backup is in some other form (like a tarball or buried deep in a directory tree) or on a filesystem other than FAT, and if the ESP is damaged to the point where you can't boot, you'll need to use an emergency system (an Ubuntu \"live CD,\" a rEFInd image on removable disk, etc.) to boot either an emergency system or your regular installation, from which you can restore the backup. This isn't a huge hassle, of course, although if you don't have such a tool handy already it could be a nuisance, especially if you don't have another computer on which to download and prepare the recovery tool. Keeping the backup in the form of a removable disk might therefore make things go just a little bit more smoothly.\n\nA: You can just copy everything inside it (i.e. e.g. sudo cp -R /boot/efi /path/to/backup is fine, however personally I'd suggest to use tar: sudo tar cfz /path/to/backup/ESP_backup.tar.gz /boot/efi);\nThe filesystem in which to store the backup is irrelevant; the only concern might be the permissions, but the UEFI firmware doesn't cater for Linux permissions (in fact FAT32 doesn't even support them), so that's not a concern at all.\n", "Q: XTerm instead of Terminal in .desktop I have this .desktop file set to update my software:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Update Software\nComment=Application\nExec=/home/david/Update_Script.sh\nIcon=/home/david/Downloads/upgrade.jpg\nCategories=Application;\nTerminal=true\n\nHowever, it launches Terminal, where I would prefer xterm. So do not mark this as a duplicate of this. I want the file to open xterm and then close xterm when the script is done. Here is what the script looks like currently:\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nDo I need to add something to the .desktop file or to the script to make it open xterm (and close it when done)?\n\nA: .desktop and the Ctrl-Alt-T shortcut all launch x-terminal-emulator , which is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/x-terminal-emulator , which in turn is a symlink to /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.wrapper. In short, gnome-terminal aka Terminal is the default terminal emulator on Ubuntu.\nIf you want to use xterm for just one .desktop file , follow muru's suggestion in the comments and use use \nExec=xterm -e /path/to/script.sh\n\nIf you want to globally change the terminal that the system launches by default, run \nsudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator\n\n", "Q: Kubuntu 15.10 operations get slow or hang until logout After upgrading to Kubuntu 15.10 from 14.04, I've found that some programs get much slower or completely hang over the course of a few hours of use.

Some applications deb packages have irrelevant dependencies which are actually not needed to be met for the application to work. For example Linux Process Explorer depends on schedutils which does not exist while the functionality it is meant to provide is included in some other package (util-linux AFAIK) if I understand it correctly. So, in cases like that the application can be installed with dpkg --force-all -i and function correctly, but this will break apt-get - it will refuse to work any more as far as a package with an unmet dependency is installed. I know equivs can be used to create a fake  package but this seems a way too clumsy: can't the check just be disabled?\n\nA: No, the check can't be disabled. It's been requested, and it won't happen.\nAside from faking a package for the dependency, your other options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*edit dpkg's status file (see this SU post, this SF post) (risky!)\n\n*edit the .deb file (see top voted answer on the SF post linked above)\n\n", "Q: disable services on startup in ubuntu I installed these applications on my Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*nginx\n\n*php5-fpm\n\n*mysql server\n\n*redis\n\n*...\nThese applications run every time the computer turns on.\nHow can I prevent these applications from running on start up?\nSo, these applications only run if I do \"service nginx start\".\n\nA: Use:\nsystemctl disable <service>\n\nIf you are not using systemd (Ubuntu 14.10 and earlier) use:\nupdate-rc.d -f <service> remove\n\nThe following command will give you a list of all services on your machine:\nservice --status-all\n\nYou should be able to find the names of the services you want to disable in there.\nFor more details, see enabling-and-disabling-services and for the very long answer see this post (as already mentioned by @muru).\nFor more details, see this post on Digital Ocean and the man page for systemctl.\n\nA: Another method is by installing rcconf apt-get install rcconf.

Is it valid public key?\nIf you don't use these keys, remove both of them and the message will disappear. If you are using them in different way, move them somewhere else. The same if they are in different format.\nThe public part is probably corrupted, so you can recreate it from private one using this command:\nssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\n###hostkeys possibility\nThe other possibility is that client is trying to read server public keys for HostBasedAuthentication.

I need to install two separate home folder for these two versions. (I would love it if one version of ubuntu doesn't see the home folder of the other one; but I don't know if this is possible). So to keep both the /home separate, I am planning to do the following. First I will install Ubuntu 12.04 by creating / (root folder) and /home partition (also a swap area). Next I will install ubuntu 14.04  by creating another / (root folder) and another /home partition(no separate swap, I believe). My question is how do I tell ubuntu 14.04 not to use the /home of ubuntu 12.04 and use the /home created during its own installation? Is it handled automatically (depending on which /home partition was created during which installation)?  Last time I did this both installation went fine; but I don't think my two /home folders were mapped properly to their corresponding ubuntu versions. Please provide your suggestions. Thank You.\n\nA: During the installation process, Ubuntu will recognise the other partitions and give you the option to mount them, but unless you specifically set one of the partitions as your /home it won't determine it's a /home and use it. So, just to be clear, no Ubuntu 14.04 will not automatically use the /home from a previous installation.\n", "Q: How to combine the output of multiple `find` commands? find -type f -name \"*.avi\" -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk\nfind -type f -name \"*.mp4\" -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk\n\nHow to combine these two commands?\n\n\n*\n\n*Either by combining both search terms in one command or\n\n*So that each command adds its output to the same file.\nHope it's clear what I am trying to do.\n\nA: There are many ways to do this:\nUsing Or -o:\nfind . -type f \\( -name '*.avi' -o -name '*.mp4' \\) -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk\n\nUsing Regex:\nfind . -type f  -regextype posix-extended -regex '.*\\.(avi|mp4)$' -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk\n\nBoth will write the output to the file checklist.chk.\n\nA: With the -o flag ( which is under OPERATORS in find's man page )\nfind . -type f \\( -name \"*.avi\" -o -name \"*.mp4\" \\) -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk\n\n\nA: Combining:\nfind -type f \\( -name \"*.avi\" -or -name '*.mp4' \\) -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk \n\nAdding output to one file:\nfind -type f -name \"*.avi\" -exec md5sum {} + > checklist.chk\nfind -type f -name \"*.mp4\" -exec md5sum {} + >> checklist.chk\n\n", "Q: Invoking mysql prompt in ubuntu I am not able to access the mysql prompt as after typing this mysql - u root\n in the command line according to the book Agile Web Development with Rails, 4th Edition .

Now you need to run the ecryptfs-recover-private script and it should search for any encrypted homes (or you can point it at your encrypted home files) and ask you for your old user passphrase, or the backup copy of the master passphrase you should have made when you set up your home encryption, and then it should mount your encrypted home (probably in /tmp/ecryptfs.XXXXXXXX) so you can read / back them up. May be mounted as another user, so probably will need to read as root.\nIf it errors out while searching, that's ok since you are already looking at your \"dummy\" home files \"README\" & \"ACCEESS-YOUR-PRIVATE-DATA.desktop\", which are usually in /[mountpoint]/home/[username] so just look in the /[mountpoint]/home/ folder for your encrypted files, which should be in /[mountpoint]/home/.ecryptfs/[username]/.Private and pass that to the ecryptfs-recover-private script.\nSee man ecryptfs-recover-private for more info.\nProTip: ALWAYS make BACKUPS of important data, and encryption keys/headers, so you'll never have this problem again\n", "Q: Where does Desktop Telegram save sent pictures? I use telegram with my PC. I know that telegram saves all pictures in a folder on android, is it also saving them on the PC? If so, where?\n\nA: It usually saves pictures here: ~/Downloads/Telegram Desktop/Pictures\n\nA: if you send a picture as a file, telegram doesn't save the sent picture in a separate location. It just holds the address of picture which now are located. So if you change location of that picture or rename it, you see that telegram needs to download your sent picture. \n\nA: Not sure about sent images, but received ones are in the folder you can configure in Settings > Download Path (default is a subfolder of your system's Download folder).\n\nA: The easiest way to find the folder is:\n\n*\n\n*Open a conversation in wich you have sent a file on Windows OS version of Telegram.\n\n*Right click on “OPEN WITH” link which is located just under of file.\n\n*Click on “Show in Folder”.\n\n*Now you are in the saving folder of Telegram.\n\nIf for whatever reason the above method doesn't work, try using your PC's browser and search for \"Telegram Desktop\"\nCredits to Filelocations\n", "Q: Touchpad doesn't work Please, help me.

When I reboot the VM (without rebooting XenServer) the USB cannot be seen. It's only visible when I reboot the whole XenServer.\nI ve tried a few stuff but I am not sure if it's a XenServer issue or an Ubuntu one (under a VM).\nFWIW, I ve got in the same machine a Windows 8.1 32bit VM which doesn't have the same issue. In fact, if I reboot the XenServer and boot in Windows, the USB device can be seen ok. Then no matter how many times I reboot the Windows VM, the USB is still there. If I shutdown Windows and boot to Linux, the USB can be seen.

You can also enter a space-separated list of packages:\nsudo apt-mark hold PACKAGE_NAME\n\nTo undo this and enable automatic upgrades of this package again, use:\nsudo apt-mark unhold PACKAGE_NAME\n\nI believe that this only works for installed packages, when I try to hold back a not installed package, it does not save that state.\n\nA: Thank you for your answer.\nI've found the following solution with pinning of apt and set priority's.\nApt Pinning (ubuntuusers.de)\n", "Q: 1:1 mirror script with rsync? And do disks spin down by default? My old NAS crashed and I don't want to use a Hardware RAID controller any more so I created my first server with Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS. It's running on a SSD and stores my data on 2×3TB WD Red running in RAID1.\nEverything is running fine so far, but I want to create a Backup script to manually mirror from the RAID1 to a third 3TB drive. This third drive won't be available all the time, hence the need for this to be manually run. \nIn Windows, I've done similar things with an application called RoboCopy. it has a /mir option to do a 1:1 copy. That's what I'm aiming to do here, under Ubuntu.\nI've been reading the Help for rsync but I'm not sure I've found what I'm looking for yet.

How can I edit desktop shortcuts on Kubuntu 15.10 ? I mean properties. The command at least. If I right click the desktop shortcut and go to icon settings, there is a keyboard shortcut, which can be handy, but that's all there is. Of course I may find the particular *.desktop file on disk and edit it, but I mean the user-friendly graphical way.\n\nA: If I need to edit shortcuts I normally open a text editor (Geany or Gedit in my case, but perhaps not yours) and then do a File | Open and go to the folder where they are stored, presumably the Desktop in your case. The files should have a .desktop extension. The content looks a bit like a properties file and you can make the changes you want.\n\nA: *\n\n*unlock ur Mini-Programms\n\n*right-click on the K-Icon in the Deskbar\n\n*select \"change Applications\" (not sure if the english term is correctly translate). Then K-Menu-editor opens and u can change things. U need to save any changes. Be careful. Thats the graphical way u asked for.\n\n\nU can also place your own .desktop files into the directory /home/~/.local/share/applications/ they should get preferenced then against the ones that reside in /usr/share/applications/ there u would actually need super-user rights for editing & storing them.\nIn KDE-Environment u would use kdesudo kate as editor for root.  If you are not familiar with this it's a good help to take screencopy with Ksnapshot before changing anything. Another tip is, to read the man-page of the programm, e.g. man kpat pgdown/pgup & Q to finish – Sometimes I do like playing Klondike, so I've created a starter KPat-Klondike. The man-page tells how to start it wt an option: kpat --gametype klondike U can try this from the terminal firstly. Since you'll get a feedback on any errors there.\nAny more Questions? Keep on asking ;-)\nAnother advice is also to set up a raw installation of your choice-distro in VirtualBox and test things there. This is called \"Testing-Environment\".

I would like the files to be created with read and write rights for user and group and read for guests.\nI've set my umask to \"002\" - but it doesn's seem to change a thing. \nWhat can I try/do?\n\nA: By changing my client's user's uid to match the uid of the user on the server, everything worked perfectly.

See the picture below. \n\n\nA: I created GitHub repository for k380 configuration program.\nhttps://github.com/jergusg/k380-function-keys-conf\nI did the same steps as Mario to get sequence for k380.\nThe code is same as Mario's, but with the sequence for k380 keyboard and k380 device ID.\nIt outputs write: 0 were written instead of 7 on my computer, but it works anyway.\nThe sequences are:\nconst char k380_seq_fkeys_on[]  = {0x10, 0xff, 0x0b, 0x1e, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};\nconst char k380_seq_fkeys_off[] = {0x10, 0xff, 0x0b, 0x1e, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00};\n\n\nA: I like Jerguš's answer, but I don't want to compile c code.\nHere is the equivalent one-line bash\necho -ne \"\\x10\\xff\\x0b\\x1e\\x00\\x00\\x00\" | sudo tee /dev/[the device]\n\nEven better, this can be automatized!\nCreate a file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-logi-k380.rules with the folloing line\nACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"hidraw\", KERNEL==\"hidraw*\", SUBSYSTEMS==\"hid\", KERNELS==\"*:046D:B342.*\", RUN+=\"/bin/bash -c \\\"echo -ne '\\x10\\xff\\x0b\\x1e\\x00\\x00\\x00' > /dev/%k\\\"\"\n\nYour keyboard will be fn-locked automatically.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem and also found the article about K810, which is:\nhttp://www.trial-n-error.de/posts/2012/12/31/logitech-k810-keyboard-configurator/\nI have already tried something similar to what Mario did with K810, but I am yet to find the proper sequence that needs to be sent to K380. In fact, it's something I don't quite understand from the article. I have already sent Mario a message asking how he figured out the exact sequence, but I don't have any reply yet. \nIn case someone else tries to figure it out, this seems to be the keyboard ID, at least in my case:\n\n#define HID_DEVICE_ID_K380      (__s16)0xb342\n\nvendor ID seems to be the same:\n\n#define HID_VENDOR_ID_LOGITECH  (__u32)0x046d\n\n", "Q: Automatically add '.pdf' extension and open resulting file when printing to PDF in Firefox When I print a webpage to PDF in Firefox, it saves the file but without the .pdf extension in the name. I have installed various add-ons but ended up with the same result.\nI don't want to manually rename my files with the file manager.\nIs there a setting somewhere to change this behaviour so that the file name is always suffixed with `.pdf'? \nAnd how can I set it up to open the file with the default PDF viewer automatically after it got created?\n\nA: You can just simply add the .pdf suffix to the file name you chose yourself.\nOn Linux systems, files are not judged by their extensions, but by their content or actually by the first few bytes of their content. That way it can determine with what applications to open a file without having to rely on the names. This might sound confusing for Windows users but works pretty well.\nSo as long as you only need that PDF document on your Ubuntu system, there's no need for an extension unless you want it. And if you want to open it on Windows, you could manually rename the file (e.g. with your Files manager nautilus) afterwards.\nOr as I already said, just directly enter the full name including the .pdf extension into the print dialogue. It will even remember the name you used last (or default to mozilla.pdf, this probably depends on the version), so that you can just leave the extension there and overwrite the basename only.\n\n\nA: Firefox comes with its own PDF printer, which works well, but a alternative is to use the CUPS PDF printer (I think part of the cups-pdf package). This will should work with all apps that can print by adding a extra printer which outputs a PDF file (by default on the desktop I think) - it also automatically adds a appropriate filename based on the title (e.g. Automatically_add___pdf__extension_and_open_resulting_file_when_.pdf)\n\nFor opening the file automatically, it may be possible by defining your printer which (using a script) converts the page a pdf (using GhostScript or another program), saves it and then opens the default PDF viewer. It should be possible to find out how add a printer by examing the files installed by the Cups PDF printer package, or perhaps by using Cups commands to a custom PPD file (see here)\n\nA: The command in step 4 monitors your download folder by using a script (see step 2). The script checks the mimetype newly added files.

There are several versions of pythons installed. Say one is in /some/home/directory/Python2.6/ and the other in /some/home/directory/Python2.7/.\nIs there a simple way of changing the python version in terminal temporarily, without changing the default version of python, and without requiring root access (all the answers I have found so far does/requires one of those conditions)?\n\nA: To change the python version for your terminal session you can create an alias in your .bashrc file then re-login.\nalias python='/usr/bin/python3.4'\n\nThe link to the following article provides detailed instructions to change to an alternate Python version per user session.\n\nA: My recommendation would be to use an alias to \"override\" the python command.\n\nAn alias can be created with the same name as the core name of a command (i.e., a command without any options or arguments). In such case, it is the alias that is called (i.e., activated) first when the name is used, rather than the command with the same name. For example, an alias named ls could be created for the command ls -al as follows: \nalias ls=\"ls -al\" \n\nls is a commonly used command that by default lists the names of the files and directories within the current directory (i.e., the directory in which the user is currently working). The -a option instructs ls to also show any hidden files and directories, and the -l option tells it to provide detailed information about each file and subdirectory. \nSuch an alias can be disabled temporarily and the core command called by preceding it directly (i.e., with no spaces in between) with a backslash, i.e., \n\\ls \n\n\nTaken from linfo.org\n\nA: In your program if you mention #!/usr/bin/python2.6 as the first line then your program will consider python 2.6 as its runtime environment. And similarly if you mention python2.7 it will consider from python2.7.\nIf you want to access python from terminal then you can give python2.7 at terminal and you will get into it.\n\nA: As commented to the question, Virtual Env manages all pythons you have - Just use it\n# install pip and venv as user\npython3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip\npython3 -m pip install --user virtualenv\n\n#create the virtual env files and folders in the current dir\npython3 -m venv env\n\n# activate the virtual env by sourcing the bin file\nsource env/bin/activate\n\n#confirm it\nwhich python\n\n", "Q: Format usb and confirm all zeros I want to format my usb drive and confirm that it has been filled with all zeros.\nFor formatting this is the command I am using:\nsudo mkfs.vfat -I /dev/sdb\n\nHow do I confirm the device is filled with all zeros through the command line?\n\nA: My suggest would be hexdump. It displays the content of any file or device in hexadecimal format as rows of 16 byte, but if two subsequential lines are equal, it omits them.\nHere's an example output of the 512 MB file virtualdevice which is filled with zeroes only on the current directory of my HDD. The leftmost column is the offset of the line in hexadecimal notation, the 8 following columns are the actual data, grouped in two bytes (4 hexadecimal characters):\n$ hexdump ./virtualdevice \n0000000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000\n*\n20000000\n\n\nPerformance:\nI made the effort and compared my solution to the others by real run time and CPU time for the described example file (512 MB, containing only binary zeroes, located on HDD). \nI measured every solution with the time command two times with freshly cleared disk cache and two times with the file already being cached. The time names equal those of the time command, and the additional row CPU is just the sum of the USER+SYS times. It can exceed the REAL time because I'm running a dual-core machine.\nFor most people, the interesting figures are REAL (time from begin to end, as if measured with a stopwatch. This also contains IO wait and CPU time of other processes) and CPU (CPU time which is actually occupied by the command).\nSummary:\nThe best performance has muru's optimized second version (grep -zq . DEVICE) which uses incredibly few CPU processing time.\nRank 2 share cmp /dev/zero DEVICE (kos' optimized solution) and my own solution hexdump DEVICE. There's nearly no difference between them.\nTo pipe the data from dd to cmp (dd if=/dev/zero | cmp - DEVICE - kos' unoptimized solution) is very inefficient, the piping seems to consume much processing time.\nUsing dd and grep shows the by far worst performance of the tested commands. \nConclusion:\nAlthough the most critical part of operations like these is the IO access time, there are significant differences in the processing speed and efficiency of the tested approaches.\nIf you are very impatient, use the second version of muru's answer (grep -zq . DEVICE)!\nBut you can as well use either the second version of kos' answer (cmp /dev/zero DEVICE) or my own (hexdump device), as they have almost as good performance.\nHowever, my approach has the advantage that you immediately see the file contents and can approximate how many bytes differ from zero and where they are located. If you have much alternating data though, the output will grow large and it will probably slow down.\nWhat you should avoid in any case is to use dd and pipes. The performance of dd could probably be improved by setting a suitable buffer size, but why doing it the complicated way?\nPlease also note again that the test was done on a file on my disk instead of an actual device. Also the file contained only zeroes. Both affects the performances.\nHere are the detailed results:\n\n\n*\n\n*hexdump ./virtualdevice (my own solution):\n        |    Uncached:      |    Cached:\n Time:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:\n--------+-------------------+------------------\n   REAL |  7.689s   8.668s  |  1.868s   1.930s\n   USER |  1.816s   1.720s  |  1.572s   1.696s\n    SYS |  0.408s   0.504s  |  0.276s   0.220s\n    CPU |  2.224s   2.224s  |  1.848s   1.916s\n\n\n*dd if=./virtualdevice | grep -zq . && echo non zero (muru's unoptimized solution):\n        |    Uncached:      |    Cached:\n Time:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:\n--------+-------------------+------------------\n   REAL |  9.434s  11.004s  |  8.802s   9.266s\n   USER |  2.264s   2.364s  |  2.480s   2.528s\n    SYS | 12.876s  12.972s  | 12.676s  13.300s\n    CPU | 15.140s  15.336s  | 15.156s  15.828s\n\n\n*grep -zq . ./virtualdevice && echo non zero (muru's optimized solution):\n        |    Uncached:      |    Cached:\n Time:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:\n--------+-------------------+------------------\n   REAL |  8.763s   6.485s  |  0.770s   0.833s\n   USER |  0.644s   0.612s  |  0.528s   0.544s\n    SYS |  0.440s   0.476s  |  0.236s   0.264s\n    CPU |  1.084s   1.088s  |  0.764s   0.808s\n\n\n*dd if=/dev/zero | cmp - ./virtualdevice (kos' solution unoptimized):\n        |    Uncached:      |    Cached:\n Time:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:\n--------+-------------------+------------------\n   REAL |  7.678s   6.539s  |  3.151s   3.147s\n   USER |  2.348s   2.228s  |  2.164s   2.324s\n    SYS |  3.672s   3.852s  |  3.792s   3.516s\n    CPU |  6.020s   6.080s  |  5.956s   5.840s\n\n\n*cmp /dev/zero ./virtualdevice (kos' solution optimized):\n        |    Uncached:      |    Cached:\n Time:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:  |  Run 1:   Run 2:\n--------+-------------------+------------------\n   REAL |  6.340s   9.183s  |  1.660s   1.660s\n   USER |  1.356s   1.384s  |  1.216s   1.288s\n    SYS |  0.640s   0.596s  |  0.428s   0.360s\n    CPU |  1.996s   1.980s  |  1.644s   1.648s\n\nCommands used:\nFor all four tests I ran the following procedure twice to reduce inaccuracies, replacing <COMMAND> with the exact command from the headline of each table.\n\n\n*\n\n*Let the kernel drop all disk caches:\nsync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\n\n*First timed run (uncached), file gets loaded into the cache during this:\ntime <COMMAND>\n\n\n*Second timed run (cached).

Between personal and working-moving issues I didn't get to solve it complete.\nYesterday the internet connection broke down completely and the Ubuntu interface looked rare, with another letter format and so on. I urgently need it for work.\nSo reading some forums the best choice given my situation was to reinstall. So I reinstalled Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and that's OK.

I am at the early stages of learning shell script and appreciate any help.\n\nA: If you're willing to use a bit of Python in your code, finding the length of the shortest line is easy:\npython3 -c 'import sys; print(min(map(len, sys.stdin)))' < \"$file\"\n\nprint and min should be reasonably obvious. map(len, sys.stdin) applies the len (length) function to each entry in sys.stdin, which is each line in the standard input. Since this counts the newline in length of a line, your minimum length will be 1 more than what you'd expect. To fix that:\npython3 -c 'import sys; print(min(map(len, sys.stdin.read().splitlines())))' < \"$file\"\n\nOtherwise, a combination of awk, sort, and head:\nawk '{print length}' \"$file\" | sort | head -1\n\nhead -1 prints only the first entry, which, after sorting, would be the shortest line length. Or, entirely in bash:\n{    \n    IFS= read -r line\n    min=${#line}\n    while IFS= read -r line\n    do\n        length=${#line}\n        ((min > length)) && min=$length\n    done\n} < \"$file\"\n\necho \"shortest line's length is $min\"\n\nHere, I used { } to enclose the code section. This way, < \"$file\" applies to all of that section, so that both the first read and the while loop read from it.\n\nA: In your script there's:\nwc -l $file; echo \"lines\" && wc -L $file; echo \"longest\"\n\nYou could change it with:\nLENGTH=$(<\"$file\" wc -l)\nLONGEST=$(while read thisline; do echo \"$(<<<\"$thisline\" wc -L) $thisline\";done <\"$file\"|grep -v '^0 '|sort -t\" \"|tail -1|awk '{print $1}')\necho \"$LENGTH lines, $LONGEST longest\"\n\nThat's it, with some fix to your script output.\nThe while create a new flux of data, containing the length of each line in the file. The grep exclude empty lines (that's 0 chars in length); there are no empty line in your case, but prevent is better than cure. Then sort put line lengths in ascending order, and tail get the last line, that's the highest number (the longest line length). awk is there to clean the output (that came out from the wc, <length original_line>) taking only the number at the beginning.\n\nA: Without using a script, using just AWK:\nawk 'NR==1{x=$0}{length($0)<length(x)&&x=$0;length($0)>length(y)&&y=$0}END{print \"Shortest: \"x\"\\nLongest: \"y}' in\n\nIf you want it to prompt for a filename:\nawk 'NR==1{x=$0}{length($0)<length(x)&&x=$0;length($0)>length(y)&&y=$0}END{print \"Shortest: \"x\"\\nLongest: \"y}' \"$(read -p \"Enter a filename:\" x; printf \"$x\\n\")\"\n\nSplitting it into two different commands:\nawk 'NR==1{x=$0}length($0)<length(x){x=$0}END{print x}' in # shortest line\nawk 'length($0)>length(x){x=$0}END{print x}' in # longest line\n\nIf you want them to prompt for a filename:\nawk 'NR==1{x=$0}length($0)<length(x){x=$0}END{print x}' \"$(read -p \"Enter a filename:\" x; printf \"$x\\n\")\" # shortest line\nawk 'length($0)>length(x){x=$0}END{print x}' \"$(read -p \"Enter a filename:\" x; printf \"$x\\n\")\" # longest line\n\n$ cat in\nI have too many things to do today.\nIt's going to take to long to get everything done.\nMy day is very busy.\nWhy such a long face.\n$ awk 'NR==1{x=$0}{length($0)<length(x)&&x=$0;length($0)>length(y)&&y=$0}END{print \"Shortest: \"x\"\\nLongest: \"y}' in\nShortest: My day is very busy.\nLongest: It's going to take to long to get everything done.\n$ awk 'NR==1{x=$0}{length($0)<length(x)&&x=$0;length($0)>length(y)&&y=$0}END{print \"Shortest: \"x\"\\nLongest: \"y}' \"$(read -p \"Enter a filename:\" x; printf \"$x\\n\")\"\nEnter a filename:in\nShortest: My day is very busy.\nLongest: It's going to take to long to get everything done.\n\n", "Q: Authentication Failure on the first Ubuntu boot from my USB?

I installed KUbuntu without any problem but on a boot BIOS isnt recognizing KUbuntu. \nI have UEFI but I dont have a option to use Legacy Mode, I can only disable UEFI. I tried to enable and disable UEFI but BIOS isnt detecting KUbuntu anyway. I tried to use several Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mate & openSUSE but I'm having a same issue.\nCan someone help me please? I followed almost all online tutorials but I wasnt able to fix it. I'm not sure if there's any difference if I use 32bit Linux considering that my Windows 10 is 64bit.\nI had Ubuntu, Debian and Linux Mint on a same notebook while I was on Windows 8.1 (64bit) and I never had any issue but I'm not sure if I used 64bit versions of Linux distributions or 32bit.\nThanks\n\nA: I haven't installed Kubuntu, but when booting from CD or USB it gives you the option to boot from UEFI CD/USB or boot from CD/USB.\nIf you have UEFI active then you should install using that option.  If you have Windows installed using UEFI you need to use the UEFI option.\n64bit and 32bit should have no effect.\nWhen you boot from a live CD can you see your Kubuntu partitions?\nIf you can it installed correctly.  If you cannot then you need to install using my recommendations.\n", "Q: How to install additional language pack on Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 I am now running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and I already asked this question for 15.04, but now I was wondering if there was any change with the new release on this and whether I still need to install GNOME Language Selector third-party application?\n\nA: Yes, starting with Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 3.16+ there is now the option to install language packs through the UI rather than by having to install a third-party application.\nFor instance, if you wanted to install Korean (Korea, Republic of) you would open the gnome-control-center and go to Region & Language:\n\nWhich should take you to:\n\nThen click Language:\n\nWhich should open:\n\nAfter that click on the dots:\n\nThen search for Korean, click on it in the results list and then click Done:\n\nAfter that you should get several different dialogs which will allow you to see what will be installed and how much room it will take etc, just select the Install and Continue buttons and then enter your password in the password prompt, this will install all the things necessary for the Korean language pack on your machine.\n", "Q: awk command unable to read apache log file (user error) Stumped by this one:\nless, cat & grep are all able to list the content of an apache log file \"/var/log/apache2/other_vhosts_access.log\". But when I use awk to grab the last 5 minutes of the file then it occasionally works but most of the time it doesn't. No error given, so how to debug this one?\nawk -v date=\"$(date --date='5 minutes ago' +\"%d/%b/%Y:%T\")\" '$0~date {f=1}f' /var/log/apache2/other_vhosts_access.log >> /var/log/apache2/test/$(date +\"%F_%T\")_output.log\n\nDoes awk have issue with Apache writing to the file while trying to read it? Would it be better to pipe to awk from cat in this case?\nMy initial approach to grabbing the last 5 minutes was to use the timestamps in the log file plus some other things like IP address and byte count. All because multiple log entries will have the same timestamp. Doable but code intensive and hard to determine when logs are rotated.\nThe alternative is to count and preserve the last read line number (as an index) from the log file and at the next execution, read from there to the end of the file and updating the index. One would still have to record the timestamp of the last run to check that we're not reading more than 5 minutes at a time. Point is to graph data, so I'd rather lose data then deal with massive spikes which ruin graphs.\nThe above line is a lot more simple but not without it's own issues. How does one check if we're not accidentally duplicating data or missing data? It all hangs on cron's ability to execute at exact 300 second intervals. I was trying to test this but so far the above code doesn't yield results. dumped into an executable file and added to cron it hasn't worked yet. At least in my terminal it works occasionally.\n5 * * * * /var/log/apache2/simple.sh 2>&1 > /dev/null\n\nIf I'm going about things completely wrong, please do let me know. I've found a few things regarding grabbing the last x minutes of log files and none seem to address my concerns listed.\n\nA: Just figured out why this command doesn't work... If the date/time doesn't occur in the log file, the awk command doesn't match anything and returns nothing... I will have to read the timestamp of each line, convert it to epoch and compare if it falls in the range I'm interested in.\nOr as @Serg suggested, reduce the string to match by dropping the seconds. This does not guarantee a match, but does make it more likely.

This is NOT a good thing. You have several choices, in roughly increasing order of difficulty:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your firmware's boot manager (the same one you use to boot from an external disk) to select between Ubuntu and Windows. (Ubuntu will be listed as such, but Windows will probably be identified by the drive make and/or model.)\n\n*Install my rEFInd boot manager in Ubuntu. You must then edit /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf: Uncomment the scanfor line and ensure that hdbios is among the options. This should enable you to boot Ubuntu in EFI mode or Windows in BIOS mode. This is harder than the preceding option in the short term but easier in the long term.\n\n*Install a BIOS-mode boot loader for Ubuntu and boot both OSes in BIOS mode.\n\n*Re-install Ubuntu in BIOS mode and boot both OSes in BIOS mode.\n\n*Convert Windows to boot in EFI mode, as described here.\n\n*Re-install Windows in EFI mode. You'll definitely have to repartition the Windows disk.\n\n\nSome of these options might not work in all cases. For instance, some EFIs don't support the sort of easy mode-switching required for the first two options. Given that you've created this situation, it's doubtful if your EFI is one of the primitive ones that can't handle it, but it might be.\n", "Q: How do I add a Google account to my online accounts settings?

One boots Win7 the other Ubuntu 14. I have external USB drives with banking and other data that are encrypted with truecrypt.  I don't want to use BitLocker and have to redo my encryption because Windows 10 (if I upgrade) has bitlocker and they admit to saving your passords in their cloud (in case you forget!)\nGRC's audit has stated TrueCrypt is still safe and a security audit shows this to be the case.  I have no desire to change encryptions and it looks like another group my resurrect true crypt again.\nI have tried all manner of methods to install TrueCrypt on Ubuntu and the most I have accomplished is an icon in my navigation that does nothing.\nEven if I need to use another program to open existing truecrypt files and drives without altering them I can live with that. But I prefer to get a version of truecrypt actually working, even a stand-alone version.\nCan someone point me in the right way to be able to access my drives and files without altering them so I can also access then from Windows as well?\n( Side question, can I use a windows version via WINE to accomplish this? )\n\nA: cryptsetup from the cryptsetup-bin package that's normally installed by default, should be able to open TrueCrypt or tcplay encrypted partitions. See man cryptsetup for info like:\n   open --type tcrypt <device> <name>\n   tcryptOpen <device> <name>  (old syntax)\n\n          Opens the TCRYPT (a TrueCrypt-compatible) <device> and sets up a\n          mapping <name>.\n\n          <options> can be [--key-file, --tcrypt-hidden,  --tcrypt-system,\n          --readonly, --test-passphrase].\n\n          The  keyfile  parameter  allows combination of file content with\n          the passphrase and can be repeated. Note that using keyfiles  is\n          compatible with TCRYPT and is different from LUKS keyfile logic.\n\nI'd also use the --verbose, -v option to get more info the first time it's run, and see dmesg / /var/log/syslog if there are any errors. And once opening the device you'd still have to mount it.\nDisks / gnome-disks might provide a graphical way to open & mount partitions, and unmount/umount & close them (even if it doesn't work to open them).\n", "Q: How to prevent copying additional nonvisible text I've asked similiar question How to make copying command from website to terminal secure?.\nScenario is very simple, you want to copy something from website but what you end up with something else.\nLive demo copy text\n\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Text;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApplication1\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            -- many, many lines of code\n\n            -- many, lines of code\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n            Console.ReadLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nAt first glance everything is ok, user understand each line of code and nothing can surprise him, but when he copy/paste it to his favorite IDE/text editor he ends with:\n\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Text;\n\nnamespace ConsoleApplication1\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            -- many, many lines of code\n\n            any code for example start deleting user data\n\n            -- many, lines of code\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n            Console.ReadLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nAs you see there is additional payload. It is very easy to overlook it. The same is applicable to commands/bash scripts/sample code/git location repository.\nI know answers that state:\n\n\n*\n\n*always use trusted source\n\n*retype manually\n\n*always check anything you've copied\n\n\nThe point is that what you see is not what you get. The best solution whould be some kind of firefox extension/system clipboard utility that will warn/delete invisible text.\nIt is even possible to achieve this automatically?\n\nA: Try Firefox extension named Blank Your Monitor + Easy Reading (BYM)\nTo test BYM,\nInstall the extension.\nThen, because jsfiddle frame gets in the way we have to remove it if you want to test this with your jsfiddle demo:\n\n*\n\n*https://jsfiddle.net/v2ypLt57/embedded/result/\n\n*right mouse button\n\n*This frame\n\n*Show only this frame\n\nThere should no longer be a jsfiddle frame Result ... at the top now.\nOnce you are here then you can test:\nAll text\nPress the keyboard shortcut: ctrl-alt-z\nIt asks you:\n\nEasy Read\nNo text selected\nDo you want to select all text?\n\nOK\nResult: New tab is opened, which does uncover the any code ...\nsome text\nYou can also have BYM act on a specific segment of code.\nFor example you select from:\n        -- many, many lines of code\n\nTo:\n        -- many, lines of code\n\nPress the keyboard shortcut: ctrl-alt-z\nResult:\n-- many, many lines of code\nany code for example start deleting user data\n-- many, lines of code\n\nAs you see it revealed the normally hidden code any code for ...\nBugs\nNot sure why but the result loses indentation, probably by design since this is meant for reading long passages of text such as a book, rather than indented programming languages. Maybe you could email the extension author about it.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu With Specific UID I have run into more problems than I can bother to count by changing my UID. I'm so frustrated that I'm just going to format and start all over again. This time, I want my installation to make the first user use, let's say UID 1200. I don't want to install Ubuntu and then create all the problems by changing my UID. I don't know how to fix all those problems & it's the reason why I'm formatting. I certainly am not going to be ever doing that mistake ever again on Ubuntu. I just want Ubuntu to install using a specific UID. How do I do it?\n\nA: Method 1 - If you just want to create a user with a given UID\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu normally\n\n*Log into Ubuntu\n\n*Open a Terminal\n\n*Create a new user with the ID 1200 sudo adduser -u 1200 <username>\n\n*Confirm that the user was created with the desired id awk -F: '/\\/home/ {printf \"%s:%s\\n\",$1,$3}' /etc/passwd\n\n*Add the newly created user to the sudoers group sudo adduser <username> sudo\n\n*Logout\n\n*Login with the newly created user\n\n*(optional) Delete the old user\n\n\nMethod 2 - Automated Ubuntu installation using preseeding\nIn order to be able to define a UID range at installation time, you need to automate the Ubuntu installation using preseeding, which is basically \n\na way to to set answers to questions asked during the installation\n  process, without having to manually enter the answers while the\n  installation is running. This makes it possible to fully automate most\n  types of installation and even offers some features not available\n  during normal installations.\n\nUsing this method, which is way to extensive to be posted as part of this post, you can (amongst many other things) setup the account which will created at installation time. Example:\n# Skip creation of a root account (normal user account will be able to\n# use sudo). The default is false; preseed this to true if you want to set\n# a root password.\n#d-i passwd/root-login boolean false\n# Alternatively, to skip creation of a normal user account.\n#d-i passwd/make-user boolean false\n\n# Root password, either in clear text\n#d-i passwd/root-password password r00tme\n#d-i passwd/root-password-again password r00tme\n# or encrypted using an MD5 hash.\n#d-i passwd/root-password-crypted password [MD5 hash]\n\n# To create a normal user account.\n#d-i passwd/user-fullname string Ubuntu User\n#d-i passwd/username string ubuntu\n# Normal user's password, either in clear text\n#d-i passwd/user-password password insecure\n#d-i passwd/user-password-again password insecure\n# or encrypted using an MD5 hash.\n#d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password [MD5 hash]\n# Create the first user with the specified UID instead of the default.\n#d-i passwd/user-uid string 1010\n# The installer will warn about weak passwords. If you are sure you know\n# what you're doing and want to override it, uncomment this.\n#d-i user-setup/allow-password-weak boolean true\n\n# The user account will be added to some standard initial groups. To\n# override that, use this.\n#d-i passwd/user-default-groups string audio cdrom video\n\n# Set to true if you want to encrypt the first user's home directory.\nd-i user-setup/encrypt-home boolean false\n\nNotice the line:\n# Create the first user with the specified UID instead of the default.\nd-i passwd/user-uid string 1010\n\nIf you want to learn more about automated installations there are several sources of useful information in the Internet.

The VPN connection icon is present and all seems to indicate the VPN works. Except that I can't access the site.\nI tried connecting to VPN from my Android device and visiting the sites and it works all the time. So it clearly must be a newly introduced bug.\nUpdate 1: it appears to be a DNS leak problem, looking for a solution how to solve it in Ubuntu.\nUpdate 2: ended up writing PIA's DNS into /etc/resolv.conf manually, resolved my problem.\n\nA: So I have also discovered that possibly a bug causes DNS leaks when using a network manager openVPN connection on Ubuntu 15.10\nLAN/ISP DNS are not removed and remain available as possible DNS plus the VPN DNS. They cause the leak even though the VPN DNS are present. They might be used or not. It's random\nMy solution is to reset the VPN DNS (removing LAN DNS) by using a network manager script dispatcher calling dbus to update dnsmasq\nCreate a script /etc/NetworManager/dispatcher.d/99resetvpndns with the content\n#!/bin/sh\n\ninterface=$1\nstatus=$2\n\ncase $status in\n    vpn-up)\n    # because dnsmasq keep DNS LAN and leak our DNS, reset DNS servers to PIA ones\n    dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.dnsmasq --type=method_call /uk/org/thekelleys/dnsmasq uk.org.thekelleys.SetServers\n    dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.dnsmasq --type=method_call /uk/org/thekelleys/dnsmasq uk.org.thekelleys.SetServers uint32:3520991966\n    dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.dnsmasq --type=method_call /uk/org/thekelleys/dnsmasq uk.org.thekelleys.SetServers uint32:3520991962\n    ;;\n    vpn-down)\n    ;;\nesac\n\nand make it executable with\nchmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99resetvpndns\n\nYou need to change the uint32 value. There are your VPN DNS in integer form, not quad decimal form. Go to http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/IP2Integer.jsp to convert your DNS to integer for example.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 and Google Chrome- drag and drop off by a screen.

I'd like to not do anything too crazy if possible.\nI need to install Windows 10, when I already have Ubuntu 14.04 installed. My Laptop is a Dell.\nOK, here's what I need help with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading everything I need\n\n*Making my live USB's\n\n*Split partitions\n\n*Installing Windows 10\n\n*Repairing Grub\n\n*Fixing the UEFI to boot Grub\n\n\nA: This is a FULL solution to the problem. I'll be outlining all my steps and possible alternatives for others. A lot of thanks go out to Zacharee1 and the Ubuntu community as whole.\nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to download some tools.\n\n\n*\n\n*UNetbootin will make your live USB's. It runs on Win, Mac, and Linux.\n\n*I used Ubuntu to split my partitions from a live USB.\n\n*Grub Boot Repair. This will allow you to recognize all the OS's on all your partitions. It installs Grub2.\n\n\n*Making a Live USB and Partitioning.\n\n\n*\n\n*Run UNetbootin\n\n*You have two options on the main screen. We want to choose Disk Image, not distribution. Make sure it says .iso, then click the \"...\" button and find your Ubuntu .iso file we downloaded earlier and select it. Now make sure you're selecting USB on the main screen and the appropriate drive letter for your USB. You can ignore making extra space, as we won't be needing it for this. Then install that .iso file. It should only take a couple minutes. \n\n*Restart your PC as prompted. On restart you need to get into your Boot Menu. On my laptop this means hitting the F12 key during boot. Yours might be different. Once you're in your bios screen select your boot device (You should see your USB). It'll open Ubuntu and ask if you want to install or run from the USB in a trial version. Run the trial version.\n\n*Open Gparted from the desktop. You should see \"blocks\" of memory here. You want to Resize a partition (this makes room for a new one). So right click on the partition and select resize/move. You now see a min and max size. Don't set it directly to your minimum size, but leave room for expansion -- at least a few GB if possible. The numbers are in MB. You can google the conversion if you need to. Now click resize/move.\n\n*You are now back on the GParted main screen and a new partition labeled \"Unallocated\" has appeared. Right click on this partition and select NEW. Create it as a PRIMARY PARTITION with a files extension of NTFS. You can set the size as well; by default it'll use all the free space which is fine. You can add a label, but I find it easier to let the system name it. Now click add. You are back to the main screen. Click the Green checkmark to run both the resize operation and the NTFS formatting operation. If you are working on sizes with 100's of GB this is going to take a long time (took me 1.5 hours).\n\n\n*Installing Windows 10\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your PC and install the Windows 10 .iso to a USB using UNetbootin (same steps as in #2)\n\n*Restart your PC, hammer on your boot key (mine is F12) to enter your BIOS. Select the USB from the boot list.\n\n*Windows will walk you through installing itself. It will directly ask you to pick a partition. Select the new one you made in Step 2. When it's done it will have altered your boot settings and it will look like Ubuntu is missing (but it's not, don't panic).\n\n\n*Repairing Grub\n\n\n*\n\n*Use UNetBootin to make a live USB for the grub boot repair .iso (see previous steps for instructions)\n\n*Restart your PC and hammer on your boot key (mine is F12) to enter the BIOS. Select your USB from the boot list.\n\n*You are now in a desktop designed simply to repair GRUB for you. You the \"recommended settings\" button that pops up on the desktop. You'll be prompted to connect to the internet during the repair process. They store your log file in a URL for you to access later, nothing crazy. Once you're done you should be good to go. Grub should load automatically allowing you to select your OS when you restart the computer. But if you are unlucky like me, and restarting just throws you into Windows, go to step 5.\n\n\n*Changing your UEFI boot order.\nThis should not be necessary for most people. My UEFI and BIOS just hated me. There are three methods to fixing this: Using Ubuntu, Using Windows, and Using your BIOS. Ubuntu and Windows failed for me, using the BIOS directly worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Method. (Copied mostly from Cleaning up and changing the EFI boot order permanently using eifbootmgr)\nOpen a terminal and type:\nsudo efibootmgr -v\n\nYou'll see your boot order now. Here's my broken order, paraphrased. Yours will vary:\nBootOrder: 0005,0000,2001\nBoot0000* Ubuntu\nBoot0002* UEFI Onboard LAN IPv4\nBoot0003* UEFI Onboard LAN IPv6\nBoot0005* Windows Boot Manager\nBoot2001* EFI USB Device\n\nThe line BootOrder: 0005, 0000, 2001 is our problem. It means we're loading Windows and not Ubuntu (which holds Grub) first. We need to change this. Copy this line and change the numbers as needed for your own system:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0000,0005,2001\n\nThis will change the order to Ubuntu, then Windows, then a USB. This is specific to MY system. You need to use your own numbers, but in that exact same format. You can add more commas and numbers, but don't use any spaces and all numbers are 4 digits. Restart your PC and see if you load directly into GRUB for Ubuntu. Mine didn't stick, so I then tried the windows method below.\n\n*Windows Method. \nIf you boot into the Windows 10 OS, you can try configuring the UEFI Boot order manually. Unfortunately my system didn't detect my files properly. Here is how to do it though: Changing the Default Boot Entry These are the instructions I followed and they do a good job. I had to go to the next step though.\n\n*BIOS Method.\nThis method sucks because every BIOS interface is different. \n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your PC. Hammer on your BIOS key (mine is F12) to enter the boot menu.\n\n*Find some sort of menu that talks about boot order. Mine was hidden in an \"advanced\" tab. You should see your list and Windows will be at the top.\n\n*Using +/- you can change the order. Place Ubuntu at the TOP. My system only uses -, but it still works.\n\n*SAVE AND EXIT that screen. Exit out of your bios.\n\n*You should now see the Grub Menu (since Ubuntu is the default UEFI Boot now).\n\n*Select the OS you want.\n\n*Restart your PC one more time. If Grub pops up, then you're done and good to go. Hope this helped.\n\n\n\n\nAgain, thanks to the community for all the support articles and friendly advice. If you wish to configure your Grub Menu, please refer to Ubuntu Wiki - Grub2/Setup - Configuring GRUB 2. It has a lot of fun options to tinker with, like your timeout for loading into a default OS.\n\nA: From my experience, the non-tricky bits were to use unetbootin a bootable repair-boot memory stick, and use woeusb to make the windows install usb-stick. (I had ubuntu 17.10, and my parter insisted on dual-booting windows 10).\nThe trickier bits were maybe to deal with my specific situation: ubuntu on a SSD, with home and swap on a 1TB GPT-style hard-disk. I wanted to install windows 10 on unallocated space purposefully left on the HDD. \nThe first problem was getting windows to install -- it complained it could not install to a GPT disk (which was a bit enraging..). In my case, with an American Megatrends BIOS, the solution to turn off \"legacy\" video, ie to set UEFI video (whatever that means!). Then Windows installed -- and of course booted by default only into windows.\nThe second problem was that BIOS-selected ubuntu booted, but to a mere desktop, without keyboard. In my case, what worked was to boot and run disk repair off the prepared memory stick. Rebooting after that, I got a familiar boot menu from grub, whence the ubuntu entry got me into the situation before installing windows (plus the ability to boot into windows). (I did not have to turn off UEFI video in the BIOS.)\nMy advice for windows(10)-after-ubuntu installation is to spend a few hours researching likely problems: this led me to this page, among others. Prepare (with unetbootin), and check (by booting it) a boot-repair stick.\nPrepare (with the most up-to-date version of woeusb) a windows installation disk. When things do not work out, do not despair. Use your imagination, and wonder/research how your BIOS is involved. (Keep careful records of what you do: it may have to be backed out .. or maybe not.)\nIf things work out, consider donating to the unetbootin and woeusb projects. If not, they'll probably help out if you ask nicely, and then definitely donate. These projects give you a lot of your life back.\n", "Q: Cannot find steam.exe on wine installation I installed wine through the typical sudo apt-get install wine, then went to WineTricks and installed steam. Steam is working fine for me, but when I go to the folder\n~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/\n\nthere is no folder Steam.\nI want to know how things work, and this is making me uncomfortable. Where in the world is wine putting the steam.exe?\nI tried running\nwine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Steam/Steam.exe\n\nBut the result, as expected, was that wine cannot find the file. However, I installed Worms Armageddon off steam, and it put a file on my desktop with the contents\n[InternetShortcut]\nURL=steam://rungameid/217200\nICONFILE=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steam\\games\\fb638fa31397002929f1466b2cfd757b7dbbb6bc.ico\nICONINDEX=0\n\nSo wine obviouisly has some notion of Program Files (x86)\\Steam\n\nUPDATE:\nAlso, when I run steam uninstaller, there is no listing of \"steam\" anywhere. However, if I ho to winetricks, click install an app, I see that steam is already checked. I cannot even uninstall it now! I even uninstalled and reinstalled wine, and still can run steam. I am completely lost. I don't even want to install steam anymore, I just want to UNINSTALL it.\n\nA: I think Winetricks stores its WINEPREFIX somewhere other than .wine. You would be better off using the command line and run:\nwine ~/Downloads/SteamSetup.exe\n\nThat has worked for me every time before. Otherwise, you may just want to give up on Steam on Wine fully and run:\nsudo apt install steam\n\nIf you do this, don't uninstall Wine just yet. There are ways to use Windows games on Linux Steam. You can use Steam Play to install the said game. Go to Library → (game name) → Set launch options and add this:\nPROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%\n\nIf you want to uninstall, I think you can just use:\nsudo apt purge winetricks\nsudo apt install winetricks\n\nHope this helps. ✓\n\nA: On my system the full path is \n/home/[username]/.wine/dosdevices/c:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/Steam.exe\n\nBut it sounds like it can differ.  So try this.\nOpen a terminal and type\nwine regedit\n\n\n*\n\n*Then click the + beside HKEY_CURRENT_USER\n\n*Then click the + beside Software\n\n*Then click the + beside Valve\n\n*Then click on Steam\n\n\nIn the right hand pane look for SteamExe.  Over on the right it should show you the path to Steam.\n", "Q: How do I convert from RAID1 to JBOD with btrfs?

Yes, metadata will still be raid1 (at least if you configured it that way, which I'm assuming).  You could change that too if you want to live more dangerously with -mconvert tacked on.  \nConfirm the success showing raid levels of data and metadata with;\nbtrfs fi show\n\nAnd your new storage utilization numbers with;\nbtrfs fi df /mnt\n\nThough, as you said, you have a good backup worked out so don't care about redundancy why not raid0?

So you need to put some more information into the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nYou need to open the control panel and go to Settings > Networking.

only way to list commands, they can either be printed with command line flags, or as executable only (which is what command option does). \nFrom my comment bellow the answer:\n\ncommand, args, and cmd all give full command. In fact man page states\n  command and cmd are aliases for args , with the - flags included. The\n  comm gives the name of the exacutable only. Aliases to that are ucmd\n  and ucomm. I misread about AIX options, those can be actually\n  specified with printf-like format, %a for args, %c for comm\n\nRefer to man ps for more info on usage and available format options \nProgrammatic approach would be a bit redundant , since ps already provides us with the formatting options, but it can be done with awk, which is much useful when dealing with columnized output.\nps aux | awk '{ for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) {if ( i >= 11 ) printf $i\" \"}; printf \"\\n\" }'\n\nNote however, that this code breaks if username contains whitespace, e.g. john doe. This can be amended with adding gsub function that will elimiate your username from the ps list. However, if there is multiple users logged into system, that may be difficult to errase all of the usernames from the output. Thus, you can see that -o flag is much more preferred. \nSide note, sudo is not necessary to for listing all processes with ps\n\nA: I found a bashy way to achieve this from here\nsudo ps aux | rev | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | rev\nrev reverses the output of ps and then cut can help you out delimiting the first field(which is the last!) and then reverse it again...\nworked for me.\n", "Q: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found When I am trying to execute my hdl file with iverilog, I am getting the following error:\n/usr/local/lib/ivl/ivl: /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2015.3/lib/lnx64.o/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/ivl/ivl)\n\nSame is the case when I am simulating in Xilinx.\nI have tried everything in earlier posts but nothing seems to work.

Examples are resolv.conf.d or cron.d. \nWhere can I find more documentation about this folder structure, the types of files that can be in them, the order of precedence, etc.\n\nA: \nWhere can I find more documentation about this folder structure\n\nThis is going to fairly difficult to answer correctly since it is old (and documentation scarce). Unix System V or even earlier than that, so we are talking about 1985 roughly. Plus ... each of the different directories ending with that .d might have a different answer.\nIn general (I will try to fix on cron.d as an example but it will apply to all the others too, with some expections):\n\n*\n\n*The .d refers to the word directory. In the old days it was used to make a difference between a command and a directory. Inside that directory there will be scripts or text files that this service can handle. In cron.d there is a file anacron that is a text file that is parsed and the results are executed by cron.\nOr as explained on the debian mailing list: \"Generally when you see that *.d convention, it means \"this is a directory holding a bunch of configuration fragments which will be merged together into configuration for some service.\".\nThere is some more information in that link but ... it is simplified for some reason.\nHow to track down more information:\n\n*\n\n*If you drop the .d from the name there is most likely a man page for it. The same goes for the commands inside the directory itself (there is a man page cron and one for anacron; same goes for apparmor, usb_modeswitch resolve.conf and all of them should have a mentioning of the directory and it usage).\n\n\nthe types of files that can be in them\n\nThis will be stated in the man page. Related to cron (a part of it, the link above to the man page has a bit more but this is the most interesting):\n\nSupport  for  /etc/cron.d  is included in the cron daemon itself, which handles this location as the system-wide crontab spool.  This directory  can  contain  any  file  defining  tasks  following  the format used in  /etc/crontab, i.e. unlike the user cron spool, these files must provide the username to run the task as in the task definition.\nthe order of precedence\n\nUnless noted otherwise it will be in alphabetical order.\n", "Q: Can't connect to wpa2-enterprise networks like eduroam with certificate in 15.10 With Ubuntu 14.04 LTS I had no problem connecting to the different networks of my university, for example eduroam and others that use the same configuration.

Instead of being Windows (as this file should be), it's a copy of Shim, which then tries to launch, in turn, grubx64.efi and MokManager.efi from the same directory. Both of these files are missing, so this step displays error messages, fails, and leads to....\n\n*The computer tries to boot from EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi, which is also Shim, which tries to launch the same follow-on programs from that directory. These files are absent, so....\n\n*The computer boots EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi. This copy of Shim succeeds in launching grubx64.efi and the boot process succeeds normally.\n\n\nTracking backward in time, Boot Repair will sometimes set up copies of GRUB (and Shim and related tools) in EFI/Microsoft/Boot and in EFI/BOOT as a way of working around ugly EFI bugs that prevent some computers from remembering their boot orders. This Boot Repair practice is an ugly hack that is a workaround for an equally ugly bug. Sometimes it's necessary, but there are also cases when it's applied unnecessarily. Over-application of this copying hack was particularly common a few years ago, but the Boot Repair developers eventually stepped back and made such copying an option rather than the default.\nIn any event, it looks like this Boot Repair hack was applied to your system and then something (the GRUB update, perhaps) went in and deleted grubx64.efi and MokManager.efi from the EFI/Microsoft/Boot and EFI/BOOT directories on your ESP. This would result in precisely the behavior you see. This hypothesis is somewhat supported by the efibootmgr output in your Boot Repair output (lines 1002-1010), which shows a boot order of the Microsoft boot manager followed by Ubuntu. (There's no evidence of a boot to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi in there, but that could be the action of the EFI bug that Boot Repair's hack is intended to overcome.)\nBEWARE: You're treading in dangerous territory because your system is in a non-standard state and, if Boot Repair's hack was necessary, your firmware is defective. Attempts to fix this problem, if unsuccessful, could create even worse problems. Before you do anything else, I strongly recommend that you back up your ESP (/boot/efi in Ubuntu). That will provide some recovery options if things get worse.\nIt's possible that the following command will fix the problem:\nsudo efibootmgr -o 0001,0002,0003,2001\n\nIn theory, that at least should not make matters any worse; but if your computer really required the ugly hack of a workaround applied by Boot Repair, all bets are off. If your firmware is defective, this command may end up having no effect at all, in which case another solution may be necessary: Copy grubx64.efi, grub.cfg, and MokManager.efi from EFI/ubuntu on the ESP (/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu in Linux) to EFI/Microsoft/Boot and to EFI/BOOT on the ESP.\nIf copying the files is necessary, then your firmware is defective, and a better solution is to replace your defective computer with one that works. This may sound like an over-reaction, but certain manufacturers (HP and Sony spring to mind) have been delivering defective EFIs for years.

build-essential\n\n*On the running VirtualBox window along the top select Devices > Insert Guest addons cd image.\n\n*In your terminal navigate to: cd /media/USERNAME/ and run ls to then see what the virtual disc is called in my case it is VBOXADDITIONS_5.0.10_104061 and cd to it. \n\n*Now in the folder run sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\n*Wait for it to finish\n\n*Reboot and Enjoy.\n\n\nLet me know how you get on. \n\nA: Finally, I managed to solve the problem. In my case, the problem was that I was running older VirtualBox and after updating it, the command virtualbox-guest-dkms worked and I could switch to full screen mode.\n", "Q: I can't enter the system When I meet some errors,I shut down my computer. \nWhen I reboot it displays .\nfsck from util-linux 2.26.2\n/dev/sda10: recovering journal\n/dev/sda10: clean,282317/4087808 files,6470239/16339200 block\n\nfor a long time.\nhow can I solve it?\nps:sda10 is the part where ubuntu at.\n\nA: fsck is the disk checking utility for Ubuntu (and other Linux) systems.\nThe partition /dev/sda10 is being checked for errors.\nYou will normally just have to wait for this disk check to finish.\nIf this is happening every time you boot the system, it's probably related to whatever errors you're having before you shutdown. The OS is not happy that the system has shut down in a clean way, and is checking the partition for corruption before restarting.\nSolving the errors which cause you to shutdown is the first step towards resolving this. It may be worth starting a new question with details of the errors which cause you to shutdown, including the steps you take to shut down (e.g. using GUI, pressing power button etc.)\n", "Q: \"Password for root\" prompt on a sudoer On an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS system, I get a prompt of \"Password for root\" when logged in as a remote directory user (sssd). My user account is configured as a sudoer, both directly and via a group (from the directory):\nfred:~$ sudo egrep -v '^(#|$)' /etc/sudoers\n[sudo] password for brett:\n...\n%sudoers    ALL=(ALL) ALL\nfred        ALL=(ALL) ALL\nfred:~$ getent group | grep sudoers\nsudoers:*:00000000:joe,fred,peter\nfred:~$ getent passwd | grep fred\nfred:*:00000:11111111:Fred:/home/fred\n\nBoth passwd and group come from the directory (kerberos). I am able to sudo in console, but the UI prompts for root passwd (root has no password, which I'd like to keep that way) - on other systems, I've always been prompted for my own password, for sudo things in the background.\ngksu was previously not installed, not sure if this is required, but have installed it and am still getting the same thing.\nIs is possible to configure GUI to prompt for current user password instead of root password if current user is a sudoer?\nedit 1\nIt seems that polkit is also involved in this. I tried changing the \"sudoers\" group name in the remote directory to \"sudo\", but not sure if having 2 groups with the same name but different ids is a great idea. I've added sudoers group to AdminIdentities by editing /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf. There was no immediate success, but am rebooting now to see if it fixes it.\n\nA: Add a user as a sudoer is not enough for the GUI - the user / group also needs to be configured as an admin in polkit. For example, if you want to allow all members of the non-standard / custom sudocustom group to run sudo graphically, assuming they're configured as sudoers, you could modify /etc/polkit-1/localauthority.conf.d/51-ubuntu-admin.conf from:\nAdminIdentities=unix-group:sudo;unix-group:admin\n\nto \nAdminIdentities=unix-group:sudo;unix-group:admin;unix-group:sudocustom\n\nThis should give you a selection of users from the list of groups to elevate as (i.e. all members of sudo, admin and sudoers above).\n", "Q: Install mysql-server version 5.5.40-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 I have a test VM with mysql-server version 5.5.40-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\nI want to setup another test VM with the same version of mysql-server, but apt-get is not able to find the repository for this version of the package.\n$ sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server=5.5.40-0ubuntu0.14.04.1\n\nReading package lists...

That too, results from a misunderstanding described above.\nThe way to achieve what you want is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a web proxy (preferably lightweight, such as tinyproxy).\n\n*Add iptables rules that redirect outgoing connections made by only a specific user to ports 80,443/tcp to the local proxy.\n\n\nWhat I had in mind is described here (not my post). This way you get a web proxy log which has all the HTTP requests logged. You won't get logs related to SSL protected traffic though, which is a good thing.\nTo reiterate: URLs are not part of the IP or TCP header structure, thus something working on the IP/TCP level isn't going to be able to show you this data, unless it has some TCP dissector (tcpdump/wireshark are able to do this but not iptables alone).\n", "Q: Cannot login after turn on Window spread in Unity Tweak Tool I'm now using Ubuntu 14.04.3 and using Unity tool for change some effects.

The type username and password. Then:\nInstall dconf-tools: sudo apt-get install dconf-tools\nReset Compiz and Unity: dconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nReset Unity: setsid unity\nIf that also fails, then maybe deleting the settings files might help:\nrm  -rf ~/.compiz-1 \nrm -rf ~/.config/compiz-1\n\nLastly, you could try the following:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nunity --reset-icons\n\n\nA: I've read this thread: Unity crash in Ubuntu 14.04\nAfter all, I resolved this problem by typing\nmv ~/.config/dconf/user ~/.config/dconf/user.old\n\nI followed this tips, they changed back to the default Ubuntu settings.

I want to get involved in GNOME development, however I have one problem, there is such a large amount of code in every package, and so many files and variables that it's really hard to find bugs because you have to spend hours of your time just reading through the code to try to figure out how it actually works, so I was wondering if there is any GNOME documentation which gives a better idea of exactly how a program works internally? Or do I have to do it the hard way? Because I'm not actually too sure how new developers get involved in the project if there is so much code and such little documentation.\n\nA: So you want to contribute to (upstream) Gnome 3? I am asking, because you're posting at Ask Ubuntu and standard Ubuntu uses some GTK+/Gnome libraries as base but doesn't ship the complete Gnome Desktop environment. Unless you are using Ubuntu Gnome.\nBut even then, there is a difference between working on the Distribution and working on the Upstream project. Since a distribution always uses a \"snapshot\" or older version of Gnome, fixing bugs often means getting the patches from upstream or just changing configuration etc.\nAnyway, if you want to contribute to Gnome, they actually have some good \"getting started\" pages: GNOME: Get involved\nLook at this for example: GNOME Wiki: Welcome to the Newcomers Guide!\nCheck out \"Finding Tasks\" etc.\nYour first step will be to get the latest version, build and run it successfully, so you can test.

If you still want to use windows 10, download the official windows 10 iso from windows 10 techbench (I'd give you a link, but I'm not sure I should; just search for windows 10 techbench) and if you want to install it alongside the Ubuntu you have installed, use the custom installation to do it on a separate partition.\n", "Q: How to: setup Intel rapid start A short How TO guide, on how to setup intel rapid start on your laptop.\n\nA: So this is a short guide, since I just got it working :)\nIntel rapid start makes the laptop go into deep sleep after X(defined in bios) mins/hours. It will save you some battery life, if you leave your laptop in sleep for a long time. Read about it here: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/what-is-intel-rapid-start-technology\nMake sure your laptop supports it (check BIOS) and you have UEFI + GPT partition table. (thats what worked for me at least)\nHere how I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have 4/8GB (same as your RAM) or whatever left as free storage. (or or shrink your /home partition. Depends on your setup) I uded gparted live usb for this.\n\n*Install gdisk and do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gdisk /dev/sdX (x being a,b,c whatever)\n\n*type p to print partiton table, you should see something like 8GB\nfree.\n\n*type n, to create a new partition. If you only have like 8GB space\nfree, just type enter until you see info about Hex code or GUID.\n\n*Enter D3BFE2DE-3DAF-11DF-BA40-E3A556D89593 as a Hex code or GUID.\n\n*Finish with w and Y to write it to disk.\n\n\n*Reboot into bios, activate Intel rapid start and set how many hours\nyou think is okay. I use 1 hour.\nYou can use 1 min setup for testing. It worked for me, hope it works for you :)\nALSO: Please note you might need to patch your kernel.

I know about this page which is almost exactly what I want. Unfortunately, it is not current.\nWhat I would like to do is to have the entirety of the Ubuntu man-pages in a nice, easy to read, PDF format. I'll accept other formats but I'd prefer an indexed PDF file for simplicity and portability. \nI am also aware of HTTrack which can pull down the pages in HTML format. There are a few reasons that I wish to avoid this - the primary reason being that it's not really a nice thing to do to their bandwidth and servers.\nI've searched the Ubuntu site, used an external search engine, and have searched this site. I did find one answer that led me back to HTTrack which is a potential solution but not the ideal solution and, as mentioned, isn't very nice to their servers or bandwidth.\nEven more special would be being able to get this specifically for Lubuntu because there are a few differences in software and I'm an avid Lubuntu user but, if need be, I can make due with just the Ubuntu man-pages.\nThe reason that I want this is because, well, I'd like to read it - in its entirety. More like a book than like a file that is called when needed. I want to be able to read it while I only have access to my phone, tablet, or other compute device and in an easier to read format than the man-pages typically use.\n\nEDIT:\nSpecifically for Ubuntu (or Lubuntu) version 15.10, as noted in the tags and title. Also, yes - all the man-pages (even redundant and short ones). I'm aware that this is a lot of information which is one of the reasons that I'm trying to avoid using HTTrack.\n\nA: \nEven more special would be being able to get this specifically for Lubuntu because there are a few differences in software and I'm an avid Lubuntu user but, if need be, I can make due with just the Ubuntu man-pages.\n\nThere are no differences in manpages between Lubuntu and Ubuntu. One of the points of becoming a recognized flavour is using the same repositories as Ubuntu, so the software is identical, it's only the starting points that differ.\nAlso, http://manpages.ubuntu.com suffers from a bug where identically named manpages from different packages aren't distinguished - the manpages of the last package read show up.\nInstead of hammering the manpages site, hammer the repositories.\nGet a list of manpages, for, say, the binary-amd64 architecture (should be identical to the others):\nmkdir temp\ncd temp\ncurl http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/wily/Contents-amd64.gz | \n  gunzip | \n  grep 'share/man' |\n  sed 's/.* //;s/,/\\n/g' | \n  awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | \n  sort -u > packages.txt\nwhile IFS= read -r package\ndo\n    apt-get download \"$package\"\n    dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile \"$package\"*.deb | tar x ./usr/share/man\n    mkdir \"$package\"-manpages\n    find ./usr/share/man/man* -type f -exec mv -t \"$package\"-manpages {} +\n    rm \"$package\"*.deb\n    for page in \"$package\"-manpages/*\n    do\n        man -t \"$page\" | ps2pdf - > \"$page\".pdf\n    done\ndone < packages.txt\n\nIf course, this is going to consume an insane amount of bandwidth - the repository servers are used to it, the question is: is your network upto the task?\n\nA: For this approach, you will need html2ps,ps2pdf and a working LaTeX installation. You should be able to install all requirements with\nsudo apt-get install html2ps ghostscript texlive-latex-base\n\nOnce you've installed the required packages, run this to get the man pages as pdf files:\ncurl http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/en/man1/ | \n    grep -oP 'href=\"\\K.*?\\.1\\.html' | \n        while read man; do \n            wget http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/en/man1/\"$man\" && \n                html2ps \"$man\"  | ps2pdf - \"${man/.html/.pdf}\"\n        done\n\nYou should now have a (huge) collection of pdf files in the directory you ran the command in. By the way, make sure to run the command in a new, empty directory.\nNow, to combine them into a single, indexed PDF file, you'll need LaTeX and you'll need to rename them because LaTeX doesn't like . in file names:\nrename 's/\\./-/g;s/-pdf/\\.pdf/' *pdf\ncat <<EoF > man1.tex   \n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage[colorlinks=true,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}\n\\usepackage{pdfpages}\n\\begin{document}\n\\tableofcontents\n\\newpage\nEoF\nfor f in *.pdf; do\n    file=\"${f/.pdf/}\"\n    printf '\\section{%s}\\n\\includepdf[pages=-]{%s}\\n\\n' \"$file\" \"$f\" >> man1.tex\ndone\necho \"\\end{document}\" >> man1.tex\npdflatex man1.tex && pdflatex man1.tex\n\nThe result is an indexed PDF file of all man pages (I only used 10 for testing):\n\n\nA: \nUpdated based on Chat discussion\n\nYou want to get all the manpages in PDF (or HTML) form.  No system that I am aware of, nor any Distro for that matter, provides a complete set of all the manpages for your viewing.  That'd be millions of pages, and my guess would be lots and lots of storage space being needed, of which would be useless to actually store.  This would also be hammering the manpages server where the manpages exist already in web-viewable format.  If you really want to achieve this you'd convert the manpages yourself and download all the packages in the repositories that contain manpages.  (That's also equally evil)\nYou should not have to read all the manpages, nor do I know why you'd want that many pages.  (Imagine a seven-hundred-thousand volume encyclopedia, that's effectively what you're asking for)\n\n\nThis section was before chat cleared up misconceptions about what was being asked\n\nI don't think there's a 'PDF' for every thing, but you can make PDFs for manpages you wish to use.\nThere is a site which contains manpages for different Ubuntu releases for different packages in the Ubuntu repositories.  Assuming the manpage in question in from a Repository package, you can open the manpage there, and then print these to a file (via either Print the Page or otherwise) and then save them as a PDF, which you can then use elsewhere.\nThe downside: it's one manpage at a time - you'll have to spend time to get the ones you want.\n\n(Note: to PDF all the manpages would be a hellish project so I doubt you're going to find PDFs for every manpage you want... that'd usually be done by upstream, not Ubuntu).\n\n", "Q: System not booting with nVidia graphics card and NOMODESET in grub Installed Linux Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\nBooted to black screen\nProbably cause of NVidia Graphics Card\nTried to boot replacing quiet splash with nomodeset in the grub menu\nand then:\n\nNomodeset mode boots to another dead end.

I left some free space on hard drive (~50GB) on windows and started booting ubuntu. Everything went well untill I realised ubuntu don't recognize partitions. It's okay, because I left a free space though. But I can't even create new partition from ubuntu. I opened Disks manager on ubuntu and I can see all the partitions and that 50gb unallocated space. When I try to create partition there I get a message:\nError creating partition:\nError creating partition on /dev/sda: Command-line `parted --align optimal --script \"/dev/sda\" \"mkpart primary ext2 903869MiB 1000204886015b\"' exited with non-zero exit status 1: Warning: /dev/sda contains GPT signatures, indicating that it has a GPT table.  However, it does not have a valid fake msdos partition table, as it should.  Perhaps it was corrupted -- possibly by a program that doesn't understand GPT partition tables.  Or perhaps you deleted the GPT table, and are now using an msdos partition table.  Is this a GPT partition table?\nError: You requested a partition from 948GB to 1000GB.\nThe closest location we can manage is 948GB to 1000GB.\n (udisks-error-quark, 0)\n\nI am able to read the stack trace and what happens but it does not make sens to me. How can it contains GPT signatures as it's not even a partition but just a free space. And if apparently it does, how to remove the so I can simply create ext4 partition?\n\nA: The default install needs two partitions, a root and a swap.  You have room for only one more primary, so you need to put all the free space on the disk into an \"extended\" partition (a type of primary).  This extended partition can then hold additional partitions called \"logical partitions\", so the installer can make what it needs.\n", "Q: no wi-fi connections visible laptop:  MSI CR61 Dual Core 4GB 500GB HD8210G \nwi-fi card: Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC\nsystem: ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64\nexperience with ubuntu: beginner \nproblem:\nwi-fi connection is not visible\n\nI don't have cable connection, so solution with apt-get are not available \nwhere can I download driver files for that card?

Precisely:\n\nPing: icmp open socket: Operation not permitted. \n\nI know that sudo would rather solve my problem, but I should not log in as a superuser.\nI also know that it is (probably) all about the lack of some permissions or capabilities (in fact getcap for my copied file shows it's missing the original ping's capabilities), but unfortunately I am not able to use setcap without root privileges .. or maybe I am? Somehow?\nHow could I solve this problem and be able to use my ping file copy ./p?\n\nA: As noticed by Oli, ping is setuid ---  run as root when called. \nHowever, if you copy it with \ncp -a /usr/bin/ping ./myping\n\nthe target will lose the setuid bit --- you copy the file, but you can only create files with your own user's permissions, and your regular user can't create a setuid-root binary. It will be a huge security hole otherwise (now you can modify your copy of ping)! \nIf you want to maintain the setuid bit, you must copy with sudo cp -a. No way around this, I hope. \n\nA: -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 44168 May  7  2014 /bin/ping\n\nThe s in rws means ping is setuid. When you run it, it runs as its owner, root.\nThat's how it has the permission to ping. You can sudo setcap cap_net_raw=ep ./ping but ultimately ICMP is under \"raw sockets\" so this isn't a small number of operations. It would allow another application to spoof network traffic.\nFor this to be \"secure\" and ping, the file would have to be owned by root to stop the application being edited by other users.\nPerhaps setcap will one day let you specify a hash signature for executable too.\n", "Q: How to play sound before suspending laptop? How do you configure Ubuntu 14.04 to play a short sound just before it suspends?\nI bought a laptop which I later found had no visible status LEDs when the lid was closed. On past laptops, I've had problems with buggy ACPI drivers being sometimes unable to suspend, leading me to put a still-running laptop into a travel bag, causing the battery to die and the bag to get dangerously hot.\nSo, just for my peace of mind, I'd like to configure it to play a chime to give me an audible indication that the suspend function was engaged.\n\nA: You could create a two-line script:\n#!/bin/bash\naplay ~/Music/suspend_sound.wav\nqdbus com.canonical.Unity /com/canonical/Unity/Session com.canonical.Unity.Session.Suspend\n\nNote, that aplay has limited set of types it supports (voc, wav, raw or au), so make sure you use sound file with appropriate format. The qdbus call is specific for Unity desktop, although you can use other dbus calls to suspend from other desktops. In Ubuntu 16.04 , you can use systemctl suspend for that as well. See the related post about suspending via commands: https://askubuntu.com/a/1795/295286\n", "Q: automate adduser and add to group in one shell scrpit \nSo i am looking for a quick and easy way to auto mate adduser and at the same time add that user that you are creating to a group.

I'm simply trying to configure a script to open several new terminals, which works. The problem is that I would like to also color these terminals to my preferences.\nI found a site with lots of information about this here:\nColor Bash prompt (ArchLinux Wiki)\nThis is the command I run in a live terminal, or via the script:\ngnome-terminal --geometry 123x27+-10+14 -x PS1='\\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\u\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[1;34m\\]\\w\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\$ \\[\\e[m\\]\\[\\e[0;32m\\]'\n\nThis is what it returns me: \nFailed to execute child process \"PS1='\\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\u\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[1;34m\\]\\w\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\$ \\[\\e[m\\]\\[\\e[0;32m\\]'\" (No such file or directory)\n\nJust entering this command in a already running terminal seems to work fine:\nPS1='\\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\u\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[1;34m\\]\\w\\[\\e[m\\] \\[\\e[0;31m\\]\\$ \\[\\e[m\\]\\[\\e[0;32m\\]'\n\nTo circumvent this I was also trying to change my /etc/bash.bashrc file, but I had no luck with that modifying my default terminal color.\nI understand that the Gnome Terminal has preferences that you can set for colors, but it is far more limited than the command I want to automatically run.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: bash has --rcfile file option, that allows you to specify which config file to chose. It's not an uncommon thing for various profiles to be saved in various files, just consider gnome-terminal itself. I'd suggest you save couple of those custom bashrc files, and then call gnome-terminal -e \"bash --rcfile file\"\nExample in the screenshot:\n\n", "Q: Trying to convert a simple C program into an AWK program Hey guys a couple of weeks ago I wrote a C program that prompts the user for the name of a text file and then prompts the user for a word. The program then outputs the input text file with numbers to the left of the text and outputs the number of times the word appears in the text file. It also outputs the matching line numbers in which the words are located.\nHere is a sample of it in action:\nEnter the name of a text file: **bond.txt**\nEnter the pattern to search for: Bond\nFile contents:\n1) Secret agent Bond had been warned not to tangle with Goldfinger.\n2) But the super-criminal's latest obsession was too strong, too dangerous.\n3) He had to be stopped.\n4) Goldfinger was determined to take possession of half the supply of\n5) mined gold in the world--to rob Fort Knox!\n6) For this incredible venture he had enlisted the aid of the top\n7) criminals in the U.S.A, including a bevy of beautiful thieves from the\n8) Bronx. And it would take all of Bond's unique talents to make it fail--\n9) as fail it must.\nThere is a match on line 1\nThere is a match on line 8\n'Bond' appeared 2 times in the file bond.txt.\n\nCurrently I am trying to practice awk programming by repeating the program I did in C but using awk.\nHere is what I can muster up so far:\nBEGIN{\n    printf(\"Enter filename : \")\n    getline file < \"-\"\n    while((getline < file)) {\n        {print \"File Contents:\"}\n        {printf(\"%5d) %s\\n\", NR,$0)}\n    }\n}\n\nThis is in no way complete but what would be the best way that can allow me to parse the text file line by line to search for the word entered by the user. Any tips, tricks? Thank you.\n\nA: With awk it's much better to provide filename as command-line argument, if it's something simple as searching for matches and which lines contain the match. In pure awk this would be something like this\nawk '/searchTerm/ {print \"Match on \" NR }' inputFile.txt\n\nBut sure enough, your program can be slightly edited and turned into AWK script to do the same job, however with more lines of code. The only small quirk is that one has to press Ctrl+D to stop the while loop once file is done reading.\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f \n\nBEGIN{\n    printf(\"What do we search for:\")\n    getline searchTerm\n    printf(\"Enter filename : \")\n    getline file < \"-\"\n    print \"File Contents:\"\n\n    while((getline < file)) {       \n        x++\n        printf(\"%d) %s\\n\",x,$0)\n        if ($0 ~ searchTerm)  {i++;array[i] = x}\n    } \n    #  end while statement\n}\n\nEND{\n    print \"There were \"i\" matches on lines:\"\n    for (j=1;j<=i;j++) printf array[j]\" \";\n}\n\nBellow you will find the demo.

I'm dual-booting Windows 10 and Xubuntu 14.04. I've noticed that when Windows boots, the hard drive indicator LED on my laptop immediately starts going, and doesn't stop until about 10 minutes after I sign in. When Ubuntu boots, however, the light flutters a bit, and then only goes on when I'm reading or writing to files, or occasionally when (I assume) background processes are doing so.\nDoes Ubuntu just utilize my RAM better than Windows? Is Windows doing something that Ubuntu does not do when I sign in? Is this caused by the difference in the file systems? Does the indicator light mean something different in Ubuntu than in Windows?\nI don't think it's the last one, because I can also hear the hard drive almost constantly spinning (yes, it's the hard drive, not the fan) when Windows is running, but I hardly notice a peep out of it with Ubuntu. What's going on here?\n\nA: You usually don't hear the HDD \"spinning\", because it spins at a constant rate of usually either 5600 or 7200 rpm and is usually barely audible. What can be loud and is often noticed are the actuator (the \"arm\" on which the read/write heads are located that move over the platter) movements. And those movements only happen when data needs to read from or written to different cylinders of the disk.\n\nHowever, the used file system may actually cause a different in the actuator sounds! Ubuntu uses ext4, which starts in the middle of a partition to store data and then continues in direction of the borders. It leaves space between the files to allow them to grow without getting fragmented. All in all, the ext4 file system is designed to minimize fragmentation (file fragments being spread over the whole disk instead of being located in one sequence) and head/actuator movements, so this does not only make it faster but also quieter than Windows' ntfs, which starts at the partition beginning and always stuffs file fragments into the leftmost available holes.\nSo from the behaviour you describe we can say that something on Windows constantly accesses the HDD, while on Ubuntu there is no such process.\nI would strongly suspect your Windows Antivirus program which performs any kind of on-idle background scanning, or the search index updater, or anything like that. To determine the exact cause is however a Windows-only question and therefore topic of Super User.\nOn Ubuntu, there just don't run any of such tasks by default. We do not come with Antivirus software by default, and our ClamAV does not have any live protection but only scans on command. \n", "Q: wget, curl HTTP addresses fail, HTTPS work, ping works I am running Ubuntu Server 14.04.2, and I can't communicate with external http addresses anymore.

Using these settings I have got it work quite well (it outputs a OGV file @15 FPS, at roughly the same display size and quality as what I had):\n\n \nYou should get good results with the above - you can change most of these settings but ensure these to get the best results:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video and Audio quality at 100%\n\n*'Encode on the fly' disabled (probably optional, its speeds up things whilst recording but you have to wait afterwards)\n\n*'Zero Compression' and 'Full shots at every Frame' enabled (makes for larger size)\n\n*FPS at 15 or above\n\n*MIT-Shm enabled\n\n*Selecting only a part of the screen may improve performance, otherwise try tweaking the display settings until it co-operates\n\n\nBy the way you can use various keyboard shortcuts - e.g. Ctrl+Alt+s to stop.\nIn the above using gtk-recordMyDesktop v0.3.8 with Gnome 3.16 - it should be easy enough to get the same to happen with the Qt client or the command line client (see man recordmydeskop for that)\n\nA: I had the same problem and I switched to \"Simple Screen Recorder\" worked immediately.\n(only thing that need tweaking was that it was set to pulseaudio by default and I needed to switch that to alsa, but that setting is right there on the first page of the gui) \n", "Q: Vulnerability in Apache 2.4.12 Wiley 5.10 Security scan revealed following vulnerabilities in fully patched and updated 5.10 Wiley distro:\nCVE-2015-0253\nCVE-2015-0228\nCVE-2015-3185\nApache Security confirm 2.4.12 is vulnerable here.\nQuestion is, what is the best way to mitigate these vulnerabilities and will the repos ever have the new 2.4.16 apache available?\n\nA: You should already have the most up-to-date version available through the official repositories. \nHowever, you can use an external repository that provides newer releases.

Now it's really just a python script that uses some command line software that comes with Linux, my question is, are there some standards that I must take in mind, like some good practices. For instance is it bad that I ask for root rights?\n\nA: No, it's not bad practice to ask for root privileges.\nIf you require root privileges more than once during program runtime, then running the entire program as root will probably prove useful.\nThere aren't really any 'good practices' - if you're looking for a certain piece of advice, ask it as a question =)\nBy the way, the program you've created is called a \"GUI front-end\" - to the command your using.

Why the Ubuntu cannot use a preseed file from in the ISO is a mystery to me, but there must be a valid reason.\n\nA: Not sure if something has changed in later versions, but for Ubuntu 16.04.2 (using mini.iso for amd64), I had to use the following options for preseeding over HTTP:\nauto=true priority=critial url=http://...\n\nNote the addition of auto=true (without it, the preseed file is not even considered) and the correct spelling of priority. More information about the meaning of these keywords can be found in the manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/apbs02.html\n\nA: One solution is to extract initrd.gz, add the preseed file to root path and pack it again. In boot params file=/preseed.cfg.\nHere is an example of how to do that\n\nFirst, obtain the compressed initrd.gz file and unpack it:\nmkdir preseeded\ncd preseeded && gzip -d < path/to/initrd.gz | cpio -id\n\nAdd the preseed.cfg file and repack the initrd:\ncp mypreseed.cfg preseeded/preseed.cfg\ncd preseeded && find . | cpio -o -H newC | gzip) > path/to/initrd.gz\n\n\nI tested this solution on Ubuntu 18.04-LTS and 20.04-LTS, both minimal ISO.\nOptions with url=http://xxx/ps.cfg do not require an extract, of course; works correctly on Debian and Ubuntu.\nParams that should be added, from file auto=true priority=critical file=/preseed.cfg or from network auto=true priority=critical url=http://xxx/ps.cfg\n\nA: I experimentally found that the menu is stored in /boot/grub/grub.cfg, not /isolinux/txt.cfg.\nThis is only true if you do EFI Boot, otherwise when creating a isolinux boot ( traditional way )  txt.cfg is used.\n\nA: There is an alternative to extracting and repackaging initrd.gz: Put the preseed file into another initrd (e.g. preseed.gz) and chain-load it via\ninitrd=initrd.gz,preseed.gz\n\nIt has the advantage of not having to temper with the original initrd image.\n", "Q: What plugin do I need to install for Firefox to show the content of these websites?

Thanks.\n\nA: pgrep can print the number of processes for a given user, and xargs uns a program for every line of its input. Put that together with your ´awk` command:\n(echo root; awk -F: '{if($3>=1000)print $1}' /etc/passwd) | xargs -i sh -c 'echo \"{} $(pgrep -cu {})\"'\n\nI'm adding root manually to the output of awk. One could use \nif($3>=1000 || $3==0)\n\nin the awk command instead.\n\nA: Take advantage of the /proc filesystem: Your shell is bash, so:\nshopt -s extglob\nstat -c '%U %u' /proc/+([0-9])/ | awk '$2 >= 1000 {print $1}' | sort | uniq -c\n\n\nA: There is a simpler approach that uses ps formating options and AWK\nWe know that by default, human users have UID that ranges from 1000 to 65533 ( UID 65534 is nobody user ).\nWe also know that ps has formatting flag -o , where we can choose to output UID as well as the process. The format would be the following ( note that I am showing here only 5 first lines )\nps -eo uid,cmd | head -n 5                                           \n  UID CMD\n    0 /sbin/init\n    0 [kthreadd]\n    0 [ksoftirqd/0]\n    0 [kworker/0:0H]\n\nThus, we can do \nps -eo uid,cmd | awk '$1 >= 1000 && $1 < 65534 ' \n\nAWK helps us to print all lines where column 1, the UID is greater or equal to 1000 AND less than 635534.\nSample output from my system (where I have only one user ):\n$ ps -eo uid,cmd | awk '$1 >= 1000 && $1 < 635534 ' | tail -n 5        \n 1000 /usr/lib/at-spi2-core/at-spi2-registryd --use-gnome-session\n 1000 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox google.com\n 1000 ps -eo uid,cmd\n 1000 awk $1 >= 1000 && $1 < 635534 \n 1000 tail -n 5\n\n\nEDIT\nI've realized that OP wanted the number of processes used by human users. \nIf all you really care about is the number of processes that belong to human users, here's a quick solution:\nps --no-headers -eo uid,args --sort=uid | awk '$1 >= 1000 && $1 < 65534 {counter++}; END{print counter\" human processes\"}'\n\nAs for my previous solution, I've improved the AWK command, which uses associative arrays, based on UID, as well as added additional flags to ps command to include username and sort the output by UID. \n ps -eo uid,euser,cmd --sort=uid | awk '$1 >= 1000 && $1 < 65534 { HUMAN++; procTotals[$1]++; if( $1 > UID  ) username[$1]=$2; UID=$1  }  END{ print \"Out of \"NR\" processes, \"HUMAN\" belong to human users\";   for(i=1000;i<=UID;i++ )  print  username[i]\":\"procTotals[i] }'\n\nSample output:\nxieerqi:$ ps -eo uid,euser,cmd --sort=uid | awk '$1 >= 1000 && $1 < 65534 { HUMAN++; >\nOut of 215 processes, 88 belong to human users\nxieerqi:84\ntestuser:4\n\nFor better readability , here's the formated code. Note that awk portion could be turned into a script with #!/usr/bin/awk -f shebang line\nps -eo uid,euser,cmd --sort=uid | awk '$1 >= 1000 && $1 < 65534 { \n\nHUMAN++; procTotals[$1]++; \nif( $1 > UID  ) username[$1]=$2; UID=$1  \n\n}\n\nEND{ print \"Out of \"NR\" processes, \"HUMAN\" belong to human users\";   \n\nfor(i=1000;i<=UID;i++ )  \n    print  username[i]\":\"procTotals[i] \n\n}'\n\n", "Q: Why isn't this package auto-updating?

You know those ones you put under the laptop to make sure the intake fans are getting extra air flow.  Some laptops later in their life get clogged up.  It might be worth it to take it apart and just blow it out.  Generally this is easy to do.\nMore targeting the Ubuntu side of things. You can turn the CPU frequency down in ubuntu.\nsudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq\n\nYou also then need to make it apart of the startup process by adding a startup script.   Just type \"Startup Applications\" in the dash and add your bash script starting that application there.\nIf it is GPU you might want to think about switching to open drivers, or closed drivers and see if that helps.  You could also try something that requires less system resources and turning of system effects with something like Compiz Config Settings Manager.  It is slightly advanced so just be a little careful what you turn off.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\nA: The problem is the age of your Intel Core CPU.\nAt that time Intel's emphasis was still on processor 'power' (at the expense of excess heat and/or power needs). The only way to really solve this (with your current hardware) is to aggressively limit the CPU and graphics, and slow it further under high load (or heat).\nBasically you need add-on software to aggressively manage your thermal envelope (operating range).\n\nThat said, I no longer recommend such an approach. Intel have admitted their mistakes, and moved on ..\nFor Ubuntu:\nA modern Notebook with only the current generation (not 'sixth') Intel Core i3 mobile, 4GB RAM, and a hybrid (SSHD) drive will not 'break the bank' and may even out perform your current hardware.\n\nUPDATE: (21-Nov)\nI would suggest the HP 250 G4 (N0C12PA) with i3-4005U/4GB RAM, although you may not need the fast processor. Do a price comparison on the lesser model (N0C12PA) with Celeron N3050.\nYou need to replace the 'standard' (and slow) 5400rpm 500GB HDD (typically Seagate ST500LT012) with a faster Hybrid drive: eg. Seagate 500GB SSHD (with 8GB flash) ST500LM000.\nIf required replace 4GB SODIMM with 8GB, but first try compiles without this.\nPS: This (even with Celeron) also performs well with Windows 10 (64-bit).\n", "Q: My windows partition is Fubar, how can I at least reclaim that HDD space for my ubuntu filesystem My computer bluescreened whilst in windows. after some work and boot from an ubuntu flash drive, I was able to re-install Grub 2 and can boot into my linux partition,\nafter a failed attempt to restore the MBR for the windows partition, the partition no longer even identifies. I've tried recovering, and gpart is unable to recover any data.\nMy windows partition is hosed, I've come to piece with that. I'm here because the windows partition accounts for 80% of my HDD... So how do I get access to that sweet storage space for the OS that still works?\n\nA: Install and run gparted, delete the windows partition, then just resize the ubuntu partiton to take over that space.\n", "Q: Prevent Ubuntu RAM increase rapidly?

Over time, the data will be discarded if it is not accessed or other processes require the memory.  The cached stats show how much data is in the cache.  I would not get overly concerned about this.\nIf you do want to drop cached data (which is not advisable since you may be freeing up cached data and hence the kernel will have to re-read it again), you can write 1 to /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches to free up the pagecache.\nTo free pagecache:\necho 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nTo free reclaimable slab objects (includes dentries and inodes):\necho 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nTo free slab objects and pagecache:\necho 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\n\nA: In free output, the most important figure is + buffers/cache which is free + buffers + cached, it indicates memory available to your applications when needed.\n\n- buffers/cache == used - buffers - cached which is a good indication of memory occupied by applications\n\nLinux (kernel) makes use of unused memory for page cache (and buffer cache - it still exists) to for performance.\nfree -> not used for anything\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches frees pagecache, dentries and inodes which will return memory used for page cache / buffer cache to \"free\".\nbuffers and cached will drop and free will increase, however, that doesn't mean you have more memory available for applications.\nFor more information, check Linux at my RAM!\n\nBTW: Fedora and Arch Linux use free from procps-ng output is different.\n\nThe output combines buff/cache and removed the somewhat confusing -/+ buffers/cache.\nWe can clearly see buff/cache dropped but available did NOT change, which makes a lot more sense to end users. I personally think it is a better implementation/interpretation.\n# free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           1874         117          18           1        1737        1708\nSwap:             0           0           0\n# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n# free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           1874         117        1654           1         102        1708\nSwap:             0   \n\n", "Q: Torch7 installation issues on 14.04 I was following the steps outlined in this post http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html.

Some times I want to just shut the computer down rather than to enter the password and continue. Even if that would be someone else willing to shut my computer down while I'm away he should better be able to do this peacefully rather than by just switching the power off. Can I add shutdown to the lock screen menu for such cases?\nUpdate for those saying it's there: I use the standard Ubuntu 15.10 (not any kind of \"spin-off\" like KUbuntu nor a derivative like Mint or ElementaryOS) and all I have got in the upper-right corner gear menu is \"Switch Account\", \"Guest Session\" and \"Suspend\".\n\nA: You actually don't need to add shutdown to that menu.\nYou can click on Switch Account and you'll have Shutdown on the new screen's menu.\nThat way, it's possible to shut the computer down without logging in first. That works on ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS.\n\nA: I've found for v18.04.4 that it only had the pause option, until I clicked the user.

Qualcomm along with other manufacturers have announced open sourcing firmware for their hardware. However wireless and graphics (nvidia!) card support can still be scarce on newer machines.\nIf wireless doesn't work, then in general try:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to a distro with the latest kernel and drivers (sometimes using new firmware with some rmmod and modprobe will do the trick). For the QCA6174 the easiest thing to do is upgrade to Ubuntu 15.10 (you can use the Ubuntu software updater rather than installing 15.10 from scratch) as this has the kernel 4.2 and the ath10k firmware required.  \nAn odd thing that may happen after an upgrade is that the touchpad stops working, usually solved by detaching and then attaching the touchpad in terminal and/or reinstalling the firmware e.g. synaptics (help can be found in askubuntu).\nIn general when playing with linux, a very good idea is to have a USB mouse and a USB wireless card.  \n\n*Backports can be a very quick and convenient solution for allowing older kernels to work with software that only has support with newer kernels. You'd download backport for your distro and then the firmware packages for the NIC. About UbuntuBackports.\n\n*If the above don't work you could buy a cheap dual band ac USB wireless card for under $15 that has Linux support (check their official website). You can use this until the kernel and firmware for your NIC come out and it'll be very handy to have around should anything break.\n\n*If you need the USB port or have some other reason not to use 3, then you could get a new NIC with Linux support. Intel ones generally seem to have good support well before they even release the hardware. \n", "Q: Hide application menu from Gnome Shell Is it possible to hide application's menu like in unity.\nFirefox already hide its menu, and allow accessing it by clicking ALT button. \nI'm using GNOME Shell 3.14.4.\n\nA: If you are using the Terminal application you can simply\n\n\n*\n\n*Select View and deselect Show Menubar.\n\n\nto restore it later you can right click on the Terminal and choose select Show Menubar .\nIf you want to associate this action with a keyboard shortcuts (I see difficult to associate it  only to Alt, but for sure you can pick another combination of keys) you can set it up following [2]\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Activities overview and start typing Keyboard.\n  \n*Click on Keyboard to open the panel.\n  \n*Select the Shortcuts tab.\n  \n*Select a category in the left pane, and the row for the desired action on the right.

You should not have to use any old or previously used passwords unless the filesystem is encrypted.\nFurthermore, you should not lose access. If anything, you may have to cuse sudo at the most. In rare cases, you will have to specify read write mode when you mount the device, although, that should not be an issue here.\nAdditionally, the drive is currently set to 777 which allows access to everyone anyhow.\n", "Q: How to activate MySQL general log in version >= 5.6?

I probably corrupted my mysql configuration when I tried to install it (again) using the ubuntu package manager (stuck in the middle, because of the required interaction for which there is no screen, (package manager should really give a warning that mysql must be installed via the terminal!)). \nMaybe already before, but at least since then, I'm stuck with this error (partly in Dutch):\nFouten gevonden tijdens verwerken van:\nmysql-client-5.6\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\nI get the error when I try to install, as well as when I try to remove the package or any other mysql component.\nI found many solutions on the internet that worked for others, but failed in my case. I already did the following (in advised order, which may be different from the list below):\n\n*sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-server mysql-client mysql-common\n\n*sudo apt-get autoremove\n\n*sudo service mysql stop\n\n*sudo killall -9 mysql (no process found)\n\n*sudo killall -9 mysqld (no process found)\n\n*sudo deluser mysql\n\n*sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql\n\n*sudo apt-get purge mysql-server-core-5.5 (fails)\n\n*sudo rm -rf /var/log/mysql\n\n*sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql\n\n*sudo apt-get remove mysql-client-5.6 (fails)\n\n*sudo apt-get install mysql-client-5.6 (fails)\nI could not find a listing of all the files related to mysql, to manually delete the lot.\nAny suggestion what else I might try (except reinstalling Ubuntu entirely)?\n\nA: I had the same issue on VM with Ubuntu 14.04. The only thing worked for me is similar to what Richard Uijen has suggested:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove mysql*\nsudo apt-get autoremove mysql*\nsudo rm -rf /etc/mysql/\nsudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall mysql-client-5.6\n\nBasically you need to remove all mysql packages (mysql*), clean and install again\nAfter that I could install php7 mysql client without any issues\nsudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php7.0 php7.0-mysql\n\n\nA: Francisco's reply made me go over the\nsub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nerror message again (googled with this text and 'half-installed'. \nI then tried (I think: again):\nsudo dpkg --configure -a # (gave same error message) \nsudo dpkg -r mysql-client-5.6 # (error again)\nsudo apt-get clean\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall mysql-client-5.6\n\nThis time, it installed the package... \nI then removed it. It worked...\nAfter that, when reinstalling mysql-server, it complained about a missing directory, which was solved by making the directory. It appears to be working now.\nI'm not sure whether this is a generic solution though...\nThanks.\n", "Q: LCD Panel for Ubuntu i'm searching for an LCD Panel for a 5,25\" slot (CD Slot in a \"normal\" PC case) which is compatible with Linux Ubuntu.\nI found some on the web, but most are just controlled by a software for Windows.\nI want to show the CPU/Memory Usage, System Temperature, System Time, Uptime, Memory used on HDD sdc/md1 (my RAID1 is called md1) ect.\nI want to use it to show those information's on my HP Proliant N36L Micro Server which is at eye-line on my desk.\nI got a external USB port on my Bord and a x16 and a x1 PCIe where i could plug it.\nDoes someone know a Panel which supports this for Ubuntu?\nScincerly, Alex\n\nA: As mentioned in my comment, I have just been looking for this myself (at your prompting) and the best I've come up with at this stage is a 20x2 LCD display (likely HD44780 or compatible unit) which would have some micro-controller behind it. On that page I saw that someone had already mentioned LCD Smartie (a site I frequented year ago)which could be used to control it. But it's MS Windows only, and so it got me to searching.\nThere doesn't seem to be too much out there aimed in our market, but this would be a relatively easy project to undertake.\nAdafruit has a project on a Raspberry Pi based LCD Display version (The Raspberry Pi runs Raspian which is another Debian derivative as is Ubuntu). They have details for getting a python script up and running for it.\nI also found the man page for LCD Daemon on ubuntu.com which purports LCDproc was up and running in Natty and should be apt-get install-able in current versions. edit: it is Ubuntu lcdproc package\ntldr;\nI personally think the first one I linked above is a little pricey and it would be a fun project to do yourself, and I'm actually now thinking of doing this myself. the 16x2, 20x2 LCDs are cheap and readily available everywhere, although I'd probably go a nicer OLED screen (or screens, possibly go two!) like the 1.3\" OLEDs from adafruit.\nHopefully one of the links above will whet your appetite and inspire you to create your own.\n", "Q: System does not boot anymore after dpkg repair packages I succeeded to dual-boot Ubuntu over my Windows on my Alienware 14 (GTX 765M, i7, 8Go RAM).\nHowever,I did something wrong when trying to fix the packages using the dpkg repair (When booting in the recovery menu, by launching \"dpkg Repair broken packages\").\nNow, when I boot selecting Ubuntu from the boot menu, I simply obtain a purple screen, without loading, and it is never ending (it seems to be actually).\nDo you have any idea to fix this problem ?

The laptop has Intel HD Graphics 5500 inside, an i7 core and 8 GiB of DDR3 ram. I checked the dedicated video memory with lspci and found that by default, the amount of dedicated memory for video is 16M non-prefetchable and 256M prefetchable, which is a small amount considering the laptop having 8GiB of ram. I've googled a bit and it seems possible to increase that amount on windows but I haven't found any clue on how to do this on linux.\nAny help would be much appreciated.\nI am running Elementary OS Freya x64\n\nA: Thats a hardware thing. To actually increase it you would have upgrade the graphics hardware, most likely by adding a dedicated graphics card into a spare slot onto the motherboard (with the integrated intel ones, these are usually integrated into the motherboard or processor so to upgrade that you would need upgrade those).\nAlso note that the integrated graphics should be able to use more memory than it says in lspci, see here - basically check sudo dmesg | grep drm. This likely will be based on the system's RAM, and probably the same thing you thought Windowz could do. You should be fine according to the system requirements of the game even without this: System Requirements - EVE Online Support\nIf you are looking for how to set the video memory in Wine, try this question. PlayOnLinux should include a option to allow you to set this when installing EVE online.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wine AppDB entry\n\n*PlayOnLinux script\n", "Q: Stuck at boot after updating Nvidia drivers I just installed Kubuntu (latest version) on dual boot with Windows 8.1 on my ASUS laptop. My boot manager is rEFInd.\nI installed Kubuntu without grub (using ubiquity -b) and it installed and worked fine. \nKubuntu prompted me to install the latest drivers for my Nvidia GTX860M (my laptop also has Intel Integrated Graphics). I installed them, rebooted, and now I am stuck on the boot screen, prompting \"Wait for Plymouth screen to quit\". I cannot access the desktop nor the terminal (using alt+F2). \n1 time out of 10, I manage to access the home screen on KDE. When I log in into my session, the screen just freezes (mouse/keyboard not responding).\nI googled the issue, but all the solutions rely on using the terminal and editing the grub config file (but I am not using grub).\nWould a workaround be possible using my live USB distribution ? Also, how can I make sure Kubuntu installs the proper drivers for my GTX ?\nNote that the install is fresh, so I really don't mind erasing it if I have to, even though it would be better not to.\nThank you very much for your help.\n\nA: I managed to find a solution.\nI had to uninstall the nouveau drivers through recovery boot and install the proper nvidia drivers, the whole procedure is explained very well on this page : http://www.allaboutlinux.eu/remove-nouveau-and-install-nvidia-driver-in-ubuntu-15-04/ (You can skip the second page).\nThe only twist I had to use was to obtain the drivers (since I had no access to the desktop) using the command \"sudo apt-get install nvidia-XXX\", XXX being your driver's version (you can find the info on the Nvidia website). \nNote that this command line may or may not work out of the box (I went through a lot of trial and error to make it work).My guess is that it would also be possible to download the drivers elsewhere and mount them through the recovery, and then to follow the instructions in the guide.\nEverything worked fine afterwards.\n\nA: This is my proposed solution to most Nvidia related problems. Being unable to access tty could mean that GRUB wasn't able to load video drivers due to nouveau screwing things up. With rEFInd, you should be able to press tab to edit boot options and add nouveau.modeset=0 to boot, then follow the instructions linked prior for a permanent solution.\n", "Q: Boot hangs when DVD reader is closed -- mount issue? [15.04] I am having some non-critical but annoying issues on boot with my 15.04 system. In practice, after around 3-4 seconds the boot freezes reporting the following message:\n\nNew mount options do not match existing superblock\n\nNow, people seem to have had similar problems, but mine seems different. In fact, I noticed that if I open the door of my DVD reader the boot proceeds normally. It doesn't seem to matter if there's actually anything in the drive or not.\nNote: the boot hangs after I select to launch Ubuntu, it is not a boot priority issue. Also, Win7 on the same machine boots fine. I haven't tried anything yet, as I'm not sure where to put my hands if it is indeed a mount issue.\nI have a Dell Precision M6700, with dual boot Ubuntu 15.04 and Win7, Quadro K4000M nVidia graphic card. Needless to say, I booted without problems for 2 years and had this problem only since a couple of days. The only noticeable system change as of lately is the installation of the CUDA drivers, but I cannot remember if this happened before or after the issue. I also don't know if it's relevant, due to the fact that the DVD drive mount seems to be at fault.\n\nA: When the kernel boots it runs in boot-time temporary file system that lives as a ramdisk known as initramfs or initrd, you can see the ramdisk images on your system in the folder /boot/. \nThis may be a particular quirk of your exact OS/driver configuration, but running sudo initramfs -u updates the most recent kernels boot image to  include any changes to the boot environment since it was last generated. Typically when installing a driver package apt will run this for you if it needs it, but it appears that some package did not or otherwise the image was corrupted.\nIt is possible that the CUDA drivers get loaded early on in the kernel, and the Debian package provided failed to update the image, or some other driver/package introduced the issue.\n", "Q: What does it mean to make Tox \"portable\"? I have recently followed this guide and installed qTox, and I have noticed this section in the settings:\n\nSo what does it mean to make Tox \"portable\", and why is this something potentially dangerous to do (or is the warning notice not referring to this, but instead what is below it)? I mean I know you can already export your profile to other Tox clients on other machines, so what does it mean to also make it \"portable\"?\n\nA: When you hover the mouse over that text, it says that config files will be saved in $(PWD) where you run tox rather than in $HOME/.config. For example, if my qtox executable is on Desktop, the configs will be on Desktop.\nThis makes it easier to transport qTox as it will put everything in one place (folder).\n", "Q: How to get PamUSB working again in Ubuntu 15.10 I use pamusb to authenticate via a USB key.

It didn't happen in Ubuntu 15.04, and it doesn't seem other people have run into this.\nMy laptop is a Dell Inspiron, if it helps.\nUpdate: I later understood that this problem happens whenever the display turns on, which happens right after I lock the screen because of a bug. So, these are related events, but the actual cause is the screen turning on.\n\nA: So, the Web is truly an amazing thing! After much research and diving into many forum links, I managed to better understand the problem, to find out what program was responsible for it and, finally, to disable this behavior for good. I thought I'd write down my steps, in case other people run into the same issue.\nStep 1. Monitor the system to know if/when the keyboard backlight is being turned on\nThe first thing is to know that the current status of the keyboard backlight can be checked by reading the file /sys/devices/platform/dell-laptop/leds/dell\\:\\:kbd_backlight/brightness. So, we would like to be notified of any changes to this file and, ideally, what process invoked the change.\nThis can be done using fanotify. I used the example program that is provided in the man page and added a few modifications* so that I could monitor changes to the brightness file. Turns out that the process responsible for the modification was /usr/lib/upower/upowerd, which is a daemon process for UPower.\nStep 2. Find out why UPower is turning the backlight on (fail)\nThis was the fuzziest part of the investigation, and I still can't tell why this happens. I found a person with a very similar problem but with no solution, so I started to see if I could just disable UPower completely (and what would the consequences be) when I found this link. Turns out UPower has a configuration file! That's better.\nStep 3. Stop UPower from turning on the keyboard backlight\nFinally, I edited the aforementioned config file, located at /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.UPower.conf, and changed <allow> to <deny> in the following line:\n<allow send_destination=\"org.freedesktop.UPower\"\n       send_interface=\"org.freedesktop.UPower.KbdBacklight\"/>\n\nI then restarted dbus with sudo service dbus restart (use systemctl restart dbus.service on Ubuntu 16.04 and later) and proceeded to lock my screen to test the result and... It worked!! Well, sorta. The login screen wouldn't show up, so I couldn't log back in and had to force a restart. But then  everything worked great!\nAnd that's it! I'm still curious what would be the right way to do this. If you know, leave a comment, please!\n* For instance, the example program was only set up to monitor FAN_OPEN_PERMand FAN_CLOSE_WRITE events, but in this it was an FAN_MODIFY event.\n", "Q: How to tunnel Tox through Tor?

I know, in general, how to change which window manager I use after logging in. I do this (normally) by choosing from a slightly difficult to find menu/list of window managers. Easy.\nThere must be a backdoor way, however, of changing the window manager. i.e., there must be a config file that stores the most recent window manager choice. What is it?\nMy problem is, I have a chromebook with ubuntu installed as a secondary OS, which runs in parallel with chromeos. (it's not bad.) When switching from chromeos to ubuntu, I am not presented with an ubuntu X login screen, so the opportunity to change window managers is skipped/not-available. I can't use the usual simple method. Where is the old-style config file?\nThanks.\n\nA: In the old days of Unix, one would login to console first and run startx, which in turn reads your .xinitrc file.  I've done this on my Arch virtual machine by following this guide. \nAlternatively, a lot of window managers have --replace flag. For instance, if you have installed openbox or gnome-shell you could do gnome-shell --replace or openbox --replace\nAdditionally, AccountsService sets most recent window manager session in /var/lib/AccountsService/users/USERNAME file. For instance, I have:\n[User]\nXSession=gnome\nBackground=/usr/share/backgrounds/dream-hippocampus.jpg\nSystemAccount=false\n\n\nA: Ubuntu starts the wm with a custom lightdm.\nYou have three options.\n1) remove lightdm so Ubuntu starts at cli, where you can startx or run whatever you want.\n2) configure .xinit to run any wm you want to start in\n3) modify the ubuntu lightdm or install another one thats more customizable\n", "Q: Why do variables set in my /etc/environment show up in my cron environment? For a long time, I have been used to thinking that any environment I wanted in cron, I basically needed to set in the crontab itself -- see the \"Different Environment\", likely top answer here:\nReasons why crontab does not work\nbut... on my recent Ubuntu 14.04 install, I have a crontab that looks like this:\n*/1 * * * * env > /tmp/cron.env\n\nan /etc/environment file that looks like this:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\nRACK_ENV=production\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nFROM_ETC_ENVIRONMENT=testing\n\nand the output cron.env file looks like this:\nFROM_ETC_ENVIRONMENT=testing\nHOME=/home/devops\nLOGNAME=devops\nRACK_ENV=production\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nLC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\nPWD=/home/devops\n\nthe FROM_ETC_ENVIRONMENT is a variable I created with that unique name to ensure it couldn't possibly be coming from anywhere else.\nI've looked around for documentation on when this might have changed / etc...  I guess my question is really this:\nIs this a behavior I can rely on from Ubuntu 14.04 going forward?  (Anyone know when it was introduced?  Or has it always been this way, and I just didn't realize it -- the top answer in the Reasons why crontab does not work link says that cron doesn't read from /etc/environment at all, but that seems to be wrong based on my tests.\n\nA: That answer is outdated (at least, that section is, which is from 2011). If you inspect /etc/pam.d/cron:\n$ grep pam_env /etc/pam.d/cron\n# Read environment variables from pam_env's default files, /etc/environment\n# and /etc/security/pam_env.conf.\nsession       required   pam_env.so\nsession       required   pam_env.so envfile=/etc/default/locale\n\npam_env is the PAM module that loads /etc/environment, and as you can see, it is used by cron, at least as of 14.04. And I checked a 12.04 system, and it too had pam_env loaded for cron.\n", "Q: Do I Really Need A Swap Partition? I am about to format and manually partition my hard drive for Ubuntu for the first time. I have 16GB of RAM. I am wondering if I should even allocate a swap partition? Should I just make a root partition and a home partition?\n\nA: Honestly, you can just make a root partition and you would be fine. But if you hibernate your computer, you will need the swap space. Also if you do not have a lot of ram, it will be useful to have swap space.\nRead this:\nhttps://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space\n", "Q: How to install NetSurf web browser in ubuntu 14.04 I am using 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 OS. \n\nI want to install NetSurf web browser in\n  Ubuntu 14.04\n\nThis browser supports Linux(mentioned in official site of NetSurf )\nThe only providing .deb binary for Debian\n\n\nI downloaded .deb ,from this download link,provided at official site of net surf browser.\n\nI tried to install downloaded deb file using\nsudo dpkg -i pakagename  method\nBut installation failed... \n\nWhat is the easy and correct way to install\n  NetSurf browser\n  in Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit)\n\n\nA: Go and download the source (preferably the top, most recent link on that page), and compile it yourself by extracting the archive to ~/netsurf then:\ncd ~/netsurf\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nor simply , download  *.deb file(binary file) from  official website of NetSurf\n\nand install it, by using software centre or by Gdebi package installer or \ncd into directory which consists downloaded binary file and then, install it using below command \nsudo dpkg -i package_name.deb\n\nhere, package_name is downloaded package name.\n\nif you encounter any problems dependency problems  ,\nrun, \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -f install\n\nfor me,\nthe above command solved problem occurred during installation process. \n\nA: NetSurf web browser is available in the Ubuntu repository.

Just trying snappy for the first time, wanting to develop an app but would obviously want to test it before pushing it to the app store.  I've been through the snapcraft tutorial but once you've created a snap how do you get it into a snappy machine?\nI've seen posts about 'sideloading'(?) apps but can't work out how?\nAs a start - how would I load one of the snapcraft example apps into my KVM snappy instance? (one of the ones not in the app store)\nThanks!\n\nA: Note that as you probably haven't signed your snap you will probably have to run:\nsudo snap install /path_to_yoursnap/snapname.snap \n\nafter the scp\nYou can also try a snappy-remote install, which should look like this: \nsnappy-remote --url=ssh://ubuntu@webdm.local/ install snapname.snap\n\n\nA: Once you build the snap either using snappy build or snapcraft, sideloading is simply the process of installing your snap without going through the store (exactly what you're trying to do). An analog to this in the Debian packaging world would be installing a .deb via dpkg instead of using apt-get.\nIf you have SSH enabled on your KVM instance, use scp to transfer the generated .snap over. Once you're there, simply run sudo snap install /path/to/my.snap on the KVM instance, and you just sideloaded it. You'll see it now if you run snappy list.\n", "Q: Unable to use laptop display since attaching monitor Manufacturer will be taking this in for repair.

As per this answer I was able to add a keyfile, but I noticed that the site that I created originally hadn't been saved. When I went to create another site, I figured that I just needed to use \"normal\" as the authentication type, but after selecting \"ok\", the type changed to \"ask for password\" for some reason.\nThe problem is that I don't have the keyfile associated with that site, even though the keyfile is stored in the system so when I log back in, it still asks me for my password. Given that I'm having to retroactively add the keyfile, how can I associate the keyfile with each site that I create?\n\nA: Sorry, the previously mentioned is not true. I was too naive that things can work out together.\nIn FileZilla you have to add the key using, menu Edit → Preferences → SFTP, as you did. Or make sure the key is in your ssh-agent before starting FileZilla (ssh-add -l should list the key).\nYou account in Site Manager has to have the \"Normal\" logon type with an empty password and the key should be tried automatically.\n", "Q: No sound on Ubuntu 15.10 After a fresh install on a brand new HP Probook 470 G3 everything is working perfect only sound  :-( Try to re-install all alsa parts, but still no sound.\nIf the manual is correct it is a Conexant CX7501\nAlsamixer is showing only spdif (3x) all on 0.

I have gnome and Open box desktop environment installed.\n\nA: There is no solution, since there is no problem.\nChrome Remote Desktop (as a default behaviour) does not allow you to control the ongoing session.\nInstead, it creates another virtual session on tty20, as explained in the reference.\n\nBy default, the system will create a virtual desktop that is 1600x1200 pixels in size. \n\nIt is something completely different from, say, Teamviewer, because it does not allow you to manipulate an open session.\nInstead, it creates a new one.\nThe first time that I saw it I was surprised to, and I ended up uninstalling it ;)\nGoogling a bit I found that there is a workaround to modifiy this behaviour, this.\nI just want to point out and stress that this is not the way it is intended to work, so it might end up breaking something.\n\nA: You definitely can control the active desktop session on Ubuntu 18.04 via Chrome Remote Desktop by simply following these instructions exactly.

I deleted sdb1 and would now like to resize sdb2 to take the space previously occupied by sdb1. How do I do this without destroying my data? \nCryptsetup has option called resize. What does this do? Can I just use it to enlarge the LUKS container to take all the space on the disk, then open the container and resize the underlying ext4 filesystem as I would normally do? The problem with this is that I normally use gparted to do things like this but gparted doesn't support resizing LUKS and I don't know how to do it with other tools.\n\nA: Use gparted to move the partition all the way to the left, then you can use command line parted to resize the partition, then it sounds like you can use the cryptsetup resize option to enlarge the encrypted container, then finally resize2fs to enlarge the filesystem in it.\n\nA: KDE Partition Manager 2.2.0 can resize LUKS partitions, so you won't need to deal with partition sizes manually.\nIt is not packaged for Ubuntu yet, but you can try to compile kpmcore 2.2.0 and then partitionmanager 2.2.0 yourself (which is probably less risky than resizing partitions manually).\nOr alternatively you can try some LiveCD's of distributions that have already packaged kpmcore/kde partition manager 2.2.0. E.g. Neon which is based on Ubuntu LTS.\n\nA: GParted 0.28 (released on February 2017) adds support for resizing file systems inside open LUKS volumes.\nCurrently no Ubuntu release ships that version, but it is simple to install from source, as the packaged version of libparted2 is recent enough for it to work. A apt-get build-dep gparted would give you the dependencies needed (plus apt-get install gnome-common if you need to (re)generate the configure script).\n[1] http://gparted.org/news.php?item=207\n", "Q: Wifi problem on hp 355 g2 laptop I have a problem with my wifi connection.

The -updates driver is generally better for very new cards, but it does have the risk of not working at all, breaking the graphics completely until the driver is uninstalled.\nSo, if you have a newer card, go with 352.63 normal. It should work fine. If you have an older card, or the newer version doesn't work well, go with 340.96 normal. If you're feeling daring, use the -updates version to see if it works.

Note this is for the generic kernel and not using extra features such as PAE.\n\n*Go to http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux/ (I believe this lists most if not all the old kernel packages)\n\n*In the page CTRL+F find headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic and download the\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic_x.x.xx-xx.yy_amd64.deb\n\n*linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-generic_x.x.xx-xx.yy_all.deb\n\n\n*In the page CTRL+F find image-x.x.xx-xx-generic and download the\n\n\n*\n\n*linux-image-2.6.32-21-generic_2.6.32-21.32_amd64.deb\n\n\n*Put all of these packages in a folder alone, and from that folder (cd into it) run\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nA: In Ubuntu, use browser to navigate to > http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/\nScroll to the bottom of the list; choose your kernel. Download the following files (xxxxxx will be replaced with numbers indicating the kernel version. Assuming you have a 64bit OS):\n\nlinux-headers-xxxxxx-generic-xxxxxx_amd64.deb\nlinux-headers-xxxxxx_all.deb\nlinux-image-xxxxxx-generic-xxxxxx_amd64.deb\n\nMove all these files to a folder.\ncd into it.\nInstall all these packages by running\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nChoose new kernel from grub menu.\nUpdate: Since its an ubuntu instance you can manually get the links and and use wget to download the packages\n\nA: The easiest way is to install Ubuntu Mainline Kernel Installer.In terminal type the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:cappelikan/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install mainline\n\nsee screenshot:. It is Gui-based and very easy to use to add and remove mainline (hence the name) kernels.\n", "Q: VLC 2.2.1 using Qt dialog When I upgraded from 15.04 to 15.10, this included a new version of VLC, as well as a newer Qt.

I have a computer using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with the ASUS Nvidia gt440 graphics card and a vga monitor that is supported with the resolution of 1280 X 800. \nHowever, in the display options I could not find 1280 X 800 and all the other options are either causing screen to flicker or just lower resolution.\nIs there a way to add a custom resolution in the display settings? \n\nA: You can use xrandr:\nThe commands to be executed in order (Using 1280 x 800 as your desired resolution):\ncvt 1280 800\nxrandr --newmode \"1280x800_60.00\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\n\nThe part of the line after xrandr --newmode is similar to the ouput you should get when using the cvt command, so copy the output from the \"resolution_refreshRate\" (\"1280x800_60.00\" here) point to the +vsync point and add it to xrandr --newmode.\nThen:\nxrandr --addmode LVDS1 resolution_refreshRate (don't use speechmarks)\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode resolution_refreshRate\n\nIf you want to make the changes permanent:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bash script, xrandr.sh for example, and place your xrandr commands into it: #!/bin/bash\nsudo xrandr --newmode \"\"1280x800_60.00\"\" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync\nsudo xrandr --addmode LVDS1 1280x800_60.00\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 1280x800_60.00\n\n*Make the script executable with chmod +x xrandr.sh\n\n*Search for \"Startup Applications\" in the dash, run it, and add the script as a startup application.\nThe commands will now run every time you log into your account.\nNote: I'm using LVDS1 as the supposed monitor name, but yours probably won't be the same.

I  have these 2 webservers installed on a development machine and because they both bind to port 80 only one can be running at any given time.\nI would like to be able to modify the init startup process so that I can choose which one starts and which one is disabled.\nIn order to know what I need to do to effect this, I am trying to work out what is actually controlling the startup of these services.\nMy understanding was Ubuntu 14.04 startup scripts were handled by Upstart and that upstart init scripts were in /etc/init.\nBut nginx doesn't have a nginx.conf entry in /etc/init it instead has an entry in /etc/init.d - does this then mean Nginx is managed by SysV and not Upstart?\nDoes that also mean that by default Ubuntu 14.04 (prior to the move to systemd on 15.04) possibly uses a combination of upstart and initV?\nOr is it that important system processes only are started by Upstart and individual packages like Nginx may choose either upstart or systemV init?\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 uses Upstart only, but Upstart runs SysV init scripts, too. See /etc/init/rc*.conf for the Upstart jobs that are responsible for this.\nA lot of Ubuntu packages still use SysV init scripts to minimize the differences to Debian.\n", "Q: How can I display Font Awesome fonts in Character Map?

Node.js release version > 4.x . Should I upgrade to get latest feature with better performance or run this version?\n\nA: \"Should I upgrade?\" is a question that leans toward opinion-based, but I'll try to provide some factual information that can help you make your decision.\nNode 4.2 is LTS\nWith the release of Node 4.2.0 in early October, Node adopted a \"Long Term Support\" strategy that is somewhat similar to what you might find with Ubuntu's LTS releases. They plan to make a new LTS release every year in October. Each LTS will be supported for 30 months following its release (18 months of active support, followed by a 12 month period of critical bug fixes while the release is in \"Maintenance Mode\").\nNode 4.2.0 is the first of these new LTS releases, with support planned until April 2018.\nNode 0.12 is still actively maintained\nReleased before the current LTS plan was finalized, the 0.12 release that you're currently running is a \"special case\". It is effectively being treated as an LTS release, with active status until April 2016 and critical maintenance through December 2016.\nThis chart will probably make everything more clear:\n\nSome third-party modules may not work\nAs is to be expected with a major release, there were some breaking API changes. They've published a guide for those wishing to upgrade.\nMany of the changes are not likely to affect your app directly, but it's possible that some of your app's dependencies won't play nice with Node 4.2. In particular, native addons (compiled with node-gyp) seem to be some of the most likely to be affected. There is a list of modules known not to work with Node 4. Hopefully many of these have released updates that are compatible with Node 4 over the last month. Trying to run your app with Node 4 may be the easiest way to find out.\nNew features, etc, etc\nAnd of course, there is a daunting list of new features that have been included in Node since 0.12. Maybe something in there will be valuable enough to justify the effort of upgrading your app.\n", "Q: Why is my laptop losing so much power while in suspend mode? Last time I used my laptop, I had it plugged in, and so at the time I closed the lid and put it into suspend mode, it had 100% power. However, when I opened the lid now, the a day later, and resumed work, the power is down to 40%.\nI've noticed before the laptop losing power while in suspend mode, but so far it's always been in the range of 5~10%, so I thought that was a lot, but I assumed it might be a normal amount of power drain.\nI understand that suspend mode does use a small amount of power to keep the memory in RAM, but clearly a drop from 100% to 40% in 24 hours indicates a problem.\nI already have the TLP power management system installed.\nWhy is my Ubuntu 15.10 laptop losing so much power during suspend mode?\n\nA: By default Ubuntu is not very power efficient, so, installing any third-party software will solve your problem. The best third-party software as such available is TLP.\nTo install TLP install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tlp\n", "Q: Slow Internet Connection using Wifi On ubuntu Mate 15.10 I have installed ubuntu mate 15.10 with Windows 10 but wifi works very slow.\nI have following router:\n07:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Ralink corp.

My specifications are 128 MB hard disk drive, 512 MB RAM, and 500 MHz CPU.\nI only need to run freerdp or rdesktop, absolutely nothing else.\nWhat's the point of the Ubuntu minimal ISO image? It seems small, but it downloads everything and requires much space anyway.\nTiny Core Linux fits my hard disk drive, but freerdp and rdesktop doesn't work as expected on it.\nIs there any Ubuntu distribution like Tiny Core?\n\nA: I wouldn't. I don't think it's practical to even try to install Ubuntu within 128MB.\nUbuntu is compiled to be useful, not frugal with disk space. A prime example of this is: each of Ubuntu's kernel packages is about 150MB. It's designed to be flexible, not small.\nYes, you could roll your own for just your hardware (make localmodconfig) but you'll likely end up needing to roll a lot more too. A customised start-up process, strip out Upstart/Systemd, streamline the Xorg drivers.\nYour biggest problem, perhaps, is installing. Assuming you can get the final payload beneath 128MB, the only way I can think to get it on the end device is to do a raw copy onto its media (essentially, flashing it from a virtual install you've done and trimmed elsewhere).\nAnd it's not just the up-front time needed, you also have to consider maintenance. The more you customise, the less can be updated automatically. Keeping on top of security issues will be harder because you won't have somebody compiling and packaging things for you.\nSo yes, you could spend a lot of time doing this just to get Ubuntu and the useful things Ubuntu brings with it. Or you could use something that is designed to be used on an ancient computer. I know which I'd pick.\n\nA: \nWhat's the point of ubuntu minimal iso?\n\nTo install a normal Ubuntu from a very small installation media. Not to install a core system that is basically not Ubuntu. Or as is explained on our wiki:\n\nThe minimal iso image will download packages from online archives at installation time instead of providing them on the install media itself. Downloading packages at install time reduces the size of the iso image to approximately ~40MB depending on architecture (see below), as well as providing only the packages needed for installation. The download time savings achieved by using a mini iso can be significant, as only current packages are downloaded, so there is no need to upgrade packages immediately after installation. The mini iso uses a text-based installer, making the image as compact as possible. \n\n\nIt seems small but downloads everything and requires much space anyway.\n\nTrue. Since that is not the intention of that install method ;)\n\nIs there any ubuntu dist like tinycore?\n\nNo. See Are there any linux distros that fit onto a1 128mb usb drive and have a rdp client for alternatives. Ubuntu will not be one of them. Damn small linux would be (imo) your best bet (it has rdesktop). Or Puppy Linux (also has an RDP)\n", "Q: how do I set my icon grid to a better shape? I'm running a Lubuntu 14.04 in my computer.\nI wanna use auto-arrange the icons in the desktop but the columns in wich they arrange have too wide horizontal separation.\nIs there some parameter to change this?\n\nA: I wrote iconic to solve this problem by letting you define grid dimensions for your icons. Additionally it will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow you to move icons to any of three monitors\n\n*Not suffer the \"lost icon syndrome\" that occurs when monitors of multiple resolutions are used\n\n*Sort icons alphabetically, alphabetically with \"Link to\" prefix ignored, sort by modified date ascending or date descending\n\n*Allow different grid size (columns x rows) depending on monitor, EG more on 4K monitor than 2K monitor\n\n*Instant Test button for quick experimentation on column x row changes or reserved space changes for monitor left, top, right or bottom areas\n\n*Test button will last for x seconds defined by you, clear all windows before test and restore them after test\n\n*Bash script for easy modifications\n\n\nYou can get the script on github.\nHere's the main screen:\n\nVisit the github page for iconic to see all the other screens, explanations and a copy of the script.\n", "Q: How to make xdg-open to use kde-open instead of gvfs-open?

When I had joined my organization. I had installed a fresh copy of Ubuntu 12.04 by fully removing its Windows installation. After regular upgrades and updates now it's been Ubuntu 15.04.\n  Today, I am leaving my current organization and done with all handover stuff therefore I have to reset everything from my ubuntu. So that It should look like a fresh copy of Ubuntu (15.04).\ni.e  \n\n\n*\n\n*All the softwares that I had installed.\n\n*All the users and groups that I had created\n\n*All the files that I had created and modified...etc.\n\n\nSo, the query is \n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting users would do all above things? OR  \n\n*Is there anything else required?\n\n\nA: In short, it will be a rather big hassle to revert all changes to the system and eliminate all traces of use. As you're not wanting to keep anything, I would strongly suggest you to just do a reinstall. This will be faster.\n\nAnyway, you asked for a manual removal of stuff, so I will also try to answer that. Note that I probably forgot something which might be left, or that you might easily delete a file too much and make the system unstable or unusable. No warranty on that.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\nAll the software that I had installed\n\nNo, deleting your user account will not uninstall any system-wide software! If you have installed an application in your home directory though and you opt to delete the entire home directory, it will be gone. But all programs installed through the Software Center, Synaptic, apt, apt-get, aptitude, dpkg, etc... will remain. You would have to uninstall them all manually.\nA good start for finding out  what packages you installed is the output of:\napt-mark showmanual\n\nBut prepare for a rather long list that contains also all preinstalled and system packages which you should not remove. Only uninstall those which you can remember to have installed yourself. This gets done most easily with:\nsudo apt-get purge PACKAGENAMES\n\nAfter that, also remove all no longer needed dependency packages:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\nAll the users and groups that I had created\n\nYou can only manually remove user accounts. While doing this, depending on the tool you get the option to also delete the home directory of that user or maybe even all files owned by him anywhere (can take ages of time...). Some tools automatically remove the deleted user's primary group, if it became empty. \nI would recommend you one of the following commands to remove users and their primary group and delete their home directory, depending if you want a backup archive of what got deleted or not:\nsudo deluser --remove-home --backup USERNAME\nsudo deluser --remove-home USERNAME\n\nTo remove a group, use the command below:\nsudo delgroup GROUPNAME\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\nAll the files that I had created and modified...etc.\n\nYou could do this manually or modify the deluser commands above. Chose one of them (with or without creating a backup archive of the deleted files) and run it instead of those above. Depending on the number of files you have, this might take a good while though, so better run it before you start your lunch break.\nsudo deluser --remove-all-files --backup USERNAME\nsudo deluser --remove-all-files USERNAME\n\nOr you can use find to search for all of your files:\nsudo find /DIRECTORY/TO/SEARCH -user USERNAME\n\nThis will recursively search in /DIRECTORY/TO/SEARCH and its subdirectories for all files owned by USERNAME.\nYou can immediately delete all those files (dangerous! - make sure you know the consequences, have backed up all your important data and checked the output of the find command above) with the following command:\nsudo find /DIRECTORY/TO/SEARCH -user USERNAME -delete\n\nNote that both find and deluser --remove-all-files only spot files that are owned by a user. It's unimportant who created them.\n\nA: Completely removing everything from your system and retaining a working OS\nFrom your question you started out with a fresh copy of Ubuntu by removing Windows and installing Ubuntu.  You did that with an ISO.  You replaced your Windows Partition (your Windows Installation with an Ubuntu installation).\nYou can do the same thing by replacing your current Ubuntu installation with a Fresh Ubuntu installation from a downloaded ISO.\nWhen you perform the installation you'll have options such as upgrading, or only replacing the system directories such as (/etc, /lib, /var, etc).\nYour best best would be to ensure you have backed up the system in case you are mistaken about wanting to remove everything you have installed including all the users and their files and documents.  Because if you do a complete fresh install this would be like virtually replacing the computer with a new computer where nothing from before will be there.\nI would recommend that you install the latest \"LTS\" so that the installation you leave will have official Ubuntu support for a longer period of time (upto 5 years from release).\nRemoving programs without Fresh OS Install\nAn alternative would be to actually know which programs you have installed and individually remove each program one by one by name.  You would have to use the provided method of the program itself to remove it and it's associated files.\nFor programs you installed through the normal repository or a DEB package you can uninstall the individual programs with:\nPrograms install from the repository:\n$ apt-get remove --purge packagename\n\nPrograms install from DEB packages:\n$ sudo dpkg -r packagename\n\nAfter you have removed each of the programs that you installed, then you could create a new default user with sudo access.  Log in from that account and remove/purge the user accounts that you want removed (including your own).\nThe -r option will delete the users home directory where has documents, downloads, and profiles are stored.\n$ userdel -r vivek\n\n", "Q: Configure & Run a VPN server I rent a VPS.

Every tutorial I found were dealing with files I do not have.\n\nA: You should go to /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/ , where are located some example config files. You can copy client.conf for example to your /etc/openvpn/ dir. Also , you should edit your /etc/default/openvpn and set AUTOSTART=client. This will bring your openvpn server up with config file /etc/openvpn/client.conf . Now you can go to your tutorials to configure it. \nI hope this can help you.\nRegards\n", "Q: How to get the longest word and the most frequent word starting with a specific letter? Given a list of words and their count like this:\n2 you\n1 polka\n2 dress\n3 are\n4 world\n\nI would like to write 2 Bash piped commands which will give me:\n\n\n*\n\n*The longest word starting with the letter 'a'\n\n*The most frequent word that starts with 'a'.\nI was thinking to do it with sed grep ^a but I don't know how to write the rest of the piped command.\n\nA: To get the longest word, we can use awk's length function. Then sort, then head and cut to get the right line and field.\nawk '$2~/^a/ {print length($2), $2}' file | sort -k1 | head -1 | cut -d\" \" -f1\n\nTo get the most frequent A-word, a sort and awk:\nsort -k1 file | awk '$2~/^a/ {print $2; exit}'\n\nIn real life I'd probably avoid piping things around so much. I'd probably do each in a single awk. Hard to say whether they'd actually perform faster though. awk is flexible but not that fast.\nawk 'BEGIN{lc=0;lw=\"\"} $2~/^a/ {l=length($2); if (l>lc){lc=l;lw=$2}} END{print lw}' file\nawk 'BEGIN{fc=0;fw=\"\"} $2~/^a/ {if ($1>fc){fc=$1;fw=$2}} END{print fw}' file\n\n\nA: Here's a solution without the requirement of using a pipe using AWK:\nawk '$2~/^a/{if(length($2)>length(x))x=$2}END{print x}' in\nawk '$2~/^a/{if($1>x[0]){x[0]=$1;x[1]=$2}}END{print x[1]}' in\n\nUsing Perl:\nperl -lane '$F[1]=~/^a/||next;if(length($F[1])>length($x)){$x=$F[1]};END{print($x)}' in\nperl -lane '$F[1]=~/^a/||next;if($F[0]>$x[0]){$x[0]=$F[0];$x[1]=$F[1]};END{print($x[1])}' in\n\n% cat in\n2 you\n1 polka \n2 dress\n3 are\n4 world\n1 abcd\n4 abc\n% awk '$2~/^a/{if(length($2)>length(x))x=$2}END{print x}' in\nabcd\n% awk '$2~/^a/{if($1>x[0]){x[0]=$1;x[1]=$2}}END{print x[1]}' in\nabc\n% perl -lane '$F[1]=~/^a/||next;if(length($F[1])>length($x)){$x=$F[1]};END{print($x)}' in\nabcd\n% perl -lane '$F[1]=~/^a/||next;if($F[0]>$x[0]){$x[0]=$F[0];$x[1]=$F[1]};END{print($x[1])}' in\nabc\n\n\nA: Assuming the file is foo:\n\n\n*\n\n*The longest word with a\n% awk '$2 ~ /^a/ {print length($2),$2}' foo | sort | tail -n1\n3 are\n\n\n*The most frequent word with a\n% awk '$2 ~ /^a/ {print $1,$2}' foo | sort | tail -n1\n3 are\n\nOn the other hand, why necessarily pipes?

Is that information available?\n\nA: for package lists have a look at http://packages.ubuntu.com/.\nthere is also a list of all sections or all packages for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (xenial).\nat the moment for glibc this can be offered...\n--> this means for now it can't be answered completely because a feature freeze is usually approximately 2 months before the release, so there might change something!\n\nA: Ubuntu's \"feature freeze\" is usually a couple of months before release. Until that happens, the versions of packages in the development version of the next release will continue to change,staying roughly in sync with Debian's Testing release (or is it Unstable? Note to self:check and edit this answer). \nThat said, it is rare in the extreme for package versions to go down, especially at this point in the development cycle. \nRight now, therefore, there is no way to know what version of a given package will be in the final release - but you can establish a lower bound. \n", "Q: Convert whole Website in book or pdf format Is there any way that I can download whole website content in book/pdf or any printable format.\nThis is the website which I want to convert to pdf \nhttps://www.netlab.tkk.fi/tutkimus/dtn/theone/javadoc_v141/\nto print it in hard form and then read it.

suggest that you update the ethernet driver alx. Download this package to your desktop: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2015/11/15/backports-20151115.tar.gz Right-click it and select 'Extract Here.' Now, back to the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential\ncd ~/Desktop/backports-20151115\nmake defconfig-alx\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot and tell us if there is any improvement. We will probably have one more step.\n", "Q: dpkg is confused since I manually removed installation files for spotify with sudo rm recursive So I was reading to learn on how packages and package installation works in Ubuntu in general and where do the files responsible for the existence of any application (installation files) reside in my file system. I learnt that when a package manager installs an application, spotify for example, it will place different files in different locations, and that by using the command\nsudo dpkg -L spotify-client\n\nas an example, I would be able to see where that spotify application installation files are scattered through the file system. So I decided I wanted to remove them manually and practice what I just learnt (I wish I hadn't) and I headed to every location and performed a disastrous\nsudo rm -r\n\ncommand to remove a file at a time.\nAfter that I thought that my spotify would disappear from the system and everybody will be happy but I started to see this error whenever attempting to install or remove any package\n# sudo apt-get install grive\nReading package lists...

Use subprocess.call() or subprocess.Popen() intead.\n\nHere's the first (or one of the first) deprecation proposal, dated back to 2010.\nSo you should really use subprocess.Popen() instead of os.system().\n\nWhen you run os.system() the command is executed in Dash (/bin/sh), while when you run the command in a terminal the command is executed in Bash (/bin/bash);\nDash doesn't support brace expansion and interprets {.zip,} literally;\nRun the command in Bash: change\nos.system(\"zip -r \" + PATH + \"{.zip}\")\n\nto\nos.system(\"bash -c 'zip -r \" + PATH + \"{.zip,}'\")\n\nOr anyway as Darael suggests FWIW passing /Backups/backups/20152011-120209{.zip,} to expand /Backups/backups/20152011-120209 to /Backups/backups/20152011-120209.zip and /Backups/backups/20152011-120209 you might as well just pass the paths directly avoiding to spawn another shell:\nos.system(\"zip -r \" + PATH + \".zip \" + PATH)\n\n", "Q: Converting images of different types to PDF I have a few hundred image files.

Possibly a silly question. I have my hard drive encrypted so on turning on my laptop I have to enter my hard drive password. There is nothing else on this screen. If I wish to shut down my computer at this point what is the safest way of doing it?\nI would hope there is a way of doing it without having to log in and then having to shut down.\nRunning 14.04 on my machine. It has 2 hard drives; one for Ubuntu and the other for /home. There is only full disk encryption on the OS Hard Drive.\n\nA: As you are using full-disk encryption on the OS drive, and you have not yet entered the password to decrypt that disk, you may be sure that nothing is being written there. You can also know that nothing is being written to the disk containing /home, as without decrypting the OS drive the system can't access /etc/fstab and thereby discover that it needs to mount /home, let alone actually mount it. \nAs such, it should be entirely safe to power off the machine in any reasonable way. While pulling the plug seems unnecessary, an ACPI power-off (by holding the power button) should be fine. \nAs a side note, if the system were booted to such a point that disk writes were a possibility, but login (or display-manager shutdown) wasn't, my first instinct (though probably not the best answer) would be a Magic SysRq sequence, probably REISUO, with appropriate multi-second pauses between commands. \n\nA: LVM Encrypted Ubuntu 18.04 could be shut down from the boot-time decrypt page by escaping to grub (example 2.04) command line then commanding to halt.\n[Ctrl] + [Alt] + [Delete]      (Escape to grub menu)\n[Esc]                          (Escape to grub command line)\ngrub> halt     + [Enter]       (\"The command halts the computer\")\n\n\nA: It seems as if You have some FULL drive/disk encryption, and need to \"unlock\" to boot further than the bootloader (either BIOS/UEFI, or a GNU/Linux bootloader (like GRUB))...?\nIf above is the case, I agree with earlier posters - it's safe to do a hard shutdown by pressing down the power button for the seconds needed (usually 3-6 s. depending on model). \nElaborations below...\nEven IF any other file system is mounted (or  encryption backing FS/partition), the system is basically running in a pre-boot environment with extremely little writing going on (if any)...\nHardly any fairly modern file system would fail patching up the few bytes that could disappear due to a shutdown.\n(And if You're using spinning disks (mechanical hard drives) and worry about read/write-heads falling to disk surfaces and scratching them because of power down, that won't happen, they \"auto park\" safely.)\n", "Q: After install ubuntu 14.04 , windows 8 not showing in grub  Boot Info Script e7fc706 + Boot-Repair extra info      [Boot-Info 9Feb2015]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n => No known boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  FAT32\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:  \n    Boot files:        /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi /EFI/ubuntu/MokManager.efi \n                       /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n    Operating System:  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS \n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab\n\nsda3: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       swap\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info: \n\nsdb1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       iso9660\n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: /dev/sdb1 already mounted or /mnt/BootInfo/sdb1 busy\n\nsdb2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  FAT16\n    Boot sector info:  According to the info in the boot sector, sdb2 starts \n                       at sector 0.

Yes, the @reboot is quite deceiving.\n@reboot /path/to/script\n\nIf you have questions you can visit it here, or shoot me another comment.\nCron is only meant to run in a single profile, though.\n man crontab\n\nThis command should give you more documentation on cron.\nThe -l option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output.\nThe -r option causes the current crontab to be removed.\nThe -e option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the EDITOR environment variable. \n\nA: On ubuntu 15.10 using Cron did not work. I had to modify the file:\n/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-ubuntu.conf\nand adding the line\ngreeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/synergyc <ip/host>'\ni was able to have Synergy start up and run BEFORE logging into the system. This was vrey important to me.\nThanks for the help Eddie!\nEDIT: this was a default ubuntu 15.10 setup only updates were done to the system.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 on Macbook Air 5,2 I have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my Macbook Air 5,2.

Good afternoon,\nI am interested to create an cloud using Ubuntu. For this I want to use Openstack. But also I see that that I can install also Juju and Maas. All of them work together very well and also have their role in cloud.\nMy question is: what is the order in which must be installed (1. Ubuntu Server, 2. Juju 3. Maas, 4. OpenStack)?\nFor my necessity is necessary all of them?\nIn this configuration for OpenStack can be split the instalation as default? (Network, ...)\nI must specify that the cluster will be dedicate only to: CAD, CAM, and CAE. On the cluster/cloud will never been installed site.\nThanks to all comunity for advice and support. \nI waiting your sugestion/recomandation with interest.\nKeep in touch.\n\nA: This question will lead you down the right path: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install OpenStack?\nI'll give you a high level overview of what happens when you do this so it's clear to you how the big pieces move. If you follow the link above, what we call \"The OpenStack Installer\" does everything I'm about to tell you in a nice, more automated way. It lets you pick how you want your networking, and a bunch of other questions that will fit exactly how you want to deploy your cloud. Here's an overview of what's happening: \n\n\n*\n\n*MAAS: Metal as a Service, think of this as an API for all your hardware, if you \"want a machine with X cores and X amount of disks and this kind of networking\" then you ask MAAS. MAAS registers all your hardware in it's database (you do this by enlisting them into MAAS), and then it kind of just sits there waiting for you. When you ask MAAS for a machine it gets you a machine, you don't need to install Ubuntu Server by hand, it will automatically keep images up to date and fresh for you. It's basically an Ubuntu-serving machine; it of course does more than that, but for now, consider it your broker for hardware. \n\n*Juju: Juju's job is to create what you tell it to model. You say \"I want a cloud that looks like this.\" Number of nodes, which services to put on it, etc. It takes your modelled deployment and then tells MAAS, \"go get me these machines so I can make this happen.\" MAAS then goes and turns on all the machines standing by, installs the OS, and puts whatever you told it to on each machine ... in this case, you are telling it .... give me OpenStack.\n\n*OpenStack is your cloud. Juju will take all of the OpenStack charms and execute that code on each of the nodes MAAS has provisioned. Swift, Nova, etc. These make up the basic components of a cloud, compute, networking, storage, identity, and then all the other things you might want. \n\n\nOk. Now here's where it gets like Inception (the movie). Juju's job is to model and orchestrate services. It did so and gave you a cloud, so now you have a cluster but it's empty. So what happens next is you go into your openstack dashboard, and then you can use Juju to deploy all the things you want running on your cloud. Juju doesn't just drive your cloud itself, it also puts what you want on top of your cloud. \nAt this point, unless you're adding more hardware to your cluster, you can just let the MAAS server sit there and let OpenStack manage your virtual machines and containers for all the CAD, CAM, and CAE software. You can do this by hand, or of course, write Juju charms for all the software that you want to put on your cloud. \nThe idea (and reason) these tools exist is that while saving you a bunch of time on the initial installation is a really great bonus, it's only a one-time savings, when you're setting up the cloud. By automating the modelling of the CAD, CAM, and CAE software and those workloads after you've done the installation, that's saving time over and over again. \n\nA: Note, particularly in the CAD/CAM/CAE software world, you MIGHT consider using pure MAAS and JUJU vs. adding OpenStack to the mix.  OpenStack is great if you want to partition your hardware into smaller pieces (e.g. turn 3 monster servers into 30 smaller dedicated servers) OR if you need isolation on the same hardware.  This would depend entirely on your environment, number and size of servers, and software requirements.  \nTo your specific question, there are roughly two options I see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MAAS\n\n*Install JuJu\n\n*Install OpenStack using JuJu\n\n*Install CAD/etc. using JuJu onto OpenStack\n\n\nOR\n\n\n*\n\n*Install MAAS\n\n*Install JuJu\n\n*Install CAD/etc. using JuJu via MAAS\n\n", "Q: wifi hotspot usage tracking iam using ubuntu 14.04 LTS and i enabled wifi hotspot.4 devices are connected to it.how can i know how much data they  have used and  in how much speed bandwidth is distributing among all clients? \n\nA: For how much data each uses, you can use darkstat --\nsudo apt-get install darkstat.

If you want to launch MATLAB from the Unity menu, you don't have to change those permissions and probably shouldn't.\nAll you have to do is run sudo apt-get install matlab-support in Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). That should make it so you can access MATLAB via the Unity launcher. You may have to log out and back in again to make all of changes take affect.\nThen, if you don't want to have to run MATLAB as root each time, you'll want to run cd ~ && sudo chown YOURUSERNAME -R ~/.matlab/.\nHowever, you only want to launch it by going into that folder and double-clicking on the executable, run these commands:\nsudo chmod +rwx /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Production_Server/R2015a/bin/matlab\nsudo chown YOURUSERNAME -R /usr/local/MATLAB/MATLAB_Production_Server/R2015a/\n\n", "Q: Save \"report a problem\" as a plain text file I am getting a \"report a problem\" message right after boot.

At this point, the first thing I want to do is go back to my previous version. Is there a good way to do that other than creating and using a new installation disk?\n\nA: Unfortunately, no. Due to the way upgrades work, it is VERY difficult for you to do a clean down-grade while keeping all of your files, apps, and preferences. The simplest, cleanest solution here is to back up all of your import files and do a clean re-install of your preferred version.\nI recently(AKA 15 minutes ago) went through the same process.

I cannot modify the source partition.\nIs there any way to do this?\n\nA: Try Macrium Reflect from the Windows side.

The answer is going to depend on what is the purpose of the computer. \nFor instance, a personal computer for your own use has nothing to do with a web server, or with a multiuser computer that has, for example, 100 different users in the /home directory. \nFor every situation you should define a permissions policy that adjusts to your needs. \nHaving said that, since you mentioned you are a bit new, you might want to look at, setuid, setgid and sticky bits. They are very handy when it comes to implementing certain permissions and control policies.\nCheers\n", "Q: Ubuntu can connect iphone's hotspot, but not Motorola router I am trying to connect my Xubuntu laptop to Motorola Arris surfboard sbg6782AC router.

I tried them all, but wasn't able to connect.\n\nA: Sometimes routers' broadcasting channels might interfere and cause problems in the wireless systems, (most of the routers come set up as 1st channel) so changing the channel might solve your issue.\n\nA: Yes, that was the router-computer interface problem.

How do I do install in a workstation?\n\nA: Use the Terminal Emulator to access the prompt you are looking for.  Alt+F2, then type in xterm.  Alternatively look for 'Terminal Emulator' in the Accessories submenu.\n\nA: Ubuntu has a software center where you can download some software. The icon on the left that is an orange box opens it up. Some software has to be installed through repositories on the terminal as the root user.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\n\nA: Just use a terminal. It's the same thing.

To enter one press ctrl + alt + F1 through F6. You'll have to login with your username and password before you can execute commands.\n\nA: You can open a terminal by pressing (Ctrl+Alt+T).\nFirst, you should update the package lists from the repositories. This can be done with \nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, you can install packages by issuing the command: \nsudo apt-get install package-name\nYou will be asked for your password, and once this has been provided the installation will start.\nIf you wish to upgrade the packages on your machine, \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nwill do just that. \nSimilarly, to remove a package, use\nsudo apt-get remove package\nAs you see, command line syntax is very intuitive, fast to pick up, and very powerful.\n", "Q: F.lux GUI doesn't open, unable the modify timezone/location I installed F.Lux while living in Asia.

You can edit them in graphical gconf-editor or manipulate them with gconftool:\n$ gconftool --all-entries /apps/fluxgui\n latitude = 50.9848\n autostart = 1\n longitude = 11.0299\n colortemp = 1\n$ gconftool --get /apps/fluxgui/latitude\n50.9848\n\nYou could unset a particular key from terminal with --unset or unset all keys with --recursive-unset, which should stop it from running or enable you to change the configuration through the GUI. More parameters on the manpage.\nI also looked at the package and found that xflux is, similar to what has been brought up again in recent news about F.lux on other platforms, only provided as a compiled binary in the source package (it's closed source). I recommend you move to Redshift which has seen lots of improvements in recent versions and supports multiple monitors.\n", "Q: I can't get puddletag to open?

I've downloaded the 14.04.3 iso and created a bootable usb from the iso. I've even double checked that there aren't any issues with the iso by matching the MD5 checksum. Right now my steps are:\n1) Install Windows 10 on a 200 GB partition\n2) Creating a EXT4 partition (790 GB)\n3) Creating a Swap partition (8 GB)\n4) Installing Ubuntu 14.04.3 on the two newly created partitions\nHowever, each time I go through the Ubuntu installation I get two errors. First is a \"This computer has only 0 bytes disk space remaining\" and the second is a \"Installer Crashed\" which follows with attempting to send a bug report. The installer usually crashes at the step when it is adjust timezones. I've tried various different things like creating the partitions on GParted when I enter \"try ubuntu\" and just creating the partitions in the \"do something else\" step during the installation phase. Also another unusual thing that is happening is that within \"try ubuntu\" I do not seem to be able to run the \"Install Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS\" shortcut. None of these things are working and I have been trying to search on-line for a solution but can't seem to find any resources. Does anyone have any advice? \n\nA: I met similar issues with you and finally I found a helpful post.\nWe should disable “PCI power management” to fix PCIe Bus error. Below is the steps I followed from that post:\nWhen trying to install, at the initial 'grub' screen that asks you to select (1) Try Ubuntu (2) Install directly (3) OEM install etc. Place the selector over option 1 and press the key E to edit the grub boot command. On the third line just after quiet splash, add a space and the string pcie_aspm=off and press F10 to continue the boot. This will allow you to start 15.10 from a USB/DVD and install to disk. \nThat just installs to disk. You will have to manually update the Grub boot command every time you boot into Linux until you implement the fix in the grub config file. For this edit /etc/default/grub using your favourite editor and make sure the follow line is present:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash pcie_aspm=off\"\n\nThis file is a “script that generates a script” so you have to run sudo update-grub to propagate this to the real Grub config files (/boot/grub/grub.cfg).\n\nA: Finally I got this link helpful: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2303880.\nThe root case is that 14.03 is not able to support new hardwares.

However ever since I installed it, I cannot get my ethernet connection on windows 10 to work, but wifi works fine. Ironically, the ethernet connection works but not wifi. \nConsidering this all happened after I installed ubuntu next to windows, Im guessing there is something both oses cant share.\nIve already read up numerous posts, but nothing particular seems to have worked; for either problem.\nWhat data do you guys require to help me with my problem?\nThanks in advance guys.\n\nA: I've found that since Linux (straight forms without 'non-free' code blobs) usually installs ok on Ethernet ports, as most of the firmware is available, but the wifi is usually missing.  Although I'm not nearly a Windows guru, I have found that it behaves eradicly when it's not a power on boot or a re-boot, as windows appears to assume things 'not in evidence'.  This seems especially true with Windows 10.\nSearch for threads for your wifi in the proper Linux group identifying you hardware chipset.  This should guide you through that part.  Maybe you need to do a power off reset for Windows to reset the Ethernet ports. Of course most of this is person assumptions.\nYou can find your device ID's and info with the lspci, as com ports are on a pci controller, use the v option initially and if you want more info, make if '-vv' as:\nlspci -v[v]\n\n", "Q: My Thinkpad X1 2015 freezes randomly.

When I tried, installation stops saying \"cannot install grub into sda, fatal error\".  and quits installation. \nI had created uefi ubuntu 15.04 using rufus from ubuntu amd64.iso. Also booted using USB created using Rufus. But the installation always stops saying the above error. EFI partition is already there. SDA is HDD (500GB).\n\nA: First, you should be aware of boot mode issues. The vast majority of systems that shipped with Windows 8 or later boot Windows in EFI/UEFI mode. This configuration makes a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode install of Ubuntu iffy at best. Unfortunately, a lot of BAD instructions tell people to enable their Compatibility Support Modules (CSMs; aka \"legacy mode support\" or something similar) as a routine part of installing Linux. This just complicates matters and creates problems, perhaps including the one you encountered. You can check your boot mode in the installer by dropping to a shell and looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if not, you've booted in BIOS mode. Be sure you're in EFI mode. (Assuming, of course, that Windows is in EFI mode. If you're not sure, check your partition table type. If it's GPT, Windows is booting in EFI mode. See here for more details.)\nSecond, it's imperative that you disable the Windows feature called Fast Startup (or various other things), as described here, among other places. This feature turns a shutdown operation into a suspend-to-disk operation, which makes it impossible to safely share partitions between OSes. As EFI boot loaders are stored on a shared FAT partition called the EFI System Partition (ESP), a failure to disable Fast Startup can cause problems when accessing the ESP and therefore a failure to successfully write GRUB. Note that there's a firmware feature that often has a name like \"fast boot\" that's often confused with the Windows Fast Startup feature. The firmware feature is irrelevant to this discussion. If you've disabled the firmware feature, you must still disable the Windows feature.\nThird, more information is needed to fully diagnose the problem. Running the Boot Info Script will gather a lot of data and put it in a file called RESULTS.txt. You can study this file yourself or post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here. We can then study it for clues about what's wrong.\nFourth, as a workaround, you can try using the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. Prepare the boot medium and boot using it. (You may need to disable Secure Boot if it's enabled.) rEFInd should give you the option to boot either Windows or Ubuntu. If you can boot Ubuntu with rEFInd, you can then work on fixing the boot loader problem. Maybe doing a dosfsck on the ESP would help; or you can run grub-install manually and see what sort of error messages it reports; or you can install rEFInd to your hard disk by using its PPA or Debian package. Depending on the cause, any of these actions, or various others, might help. In the meantime, you can continue using rEFInd on the external medium to boot, rather than re-install or muck about with the Ubuntu live CD, which is more limiting than the full installation.\n", "Q: Any plans to update Ubuntu 140.04 Kernel beyond 3.16.0-34-generic As per the title.

I was wondering if there was a way I could uninstall 14.04 LTS using 15.10?\n\nA: I'm assuming you installed both on your machine in a disk partition and are running one of them through your linux live USB drive.\nTo remove 14.04, just format the partition where you've installed that version of Ubuntu (while you're on Ubuntu 15.10).\nAfter formatting, you could merge that partition with another on your disk drive.\n", "Q: How to restore windows 7 acronis backup when ubuntu is installed I have windows 7 and ubuntu 14.04 both installed on my machine (Dual boot). I frequently backup my windows C drive with acronis backup utility in case something happens and I can not access my windows. I made a bootable media(on my 16GB flash) to restore my backups(on my external hard drive) with that. I used this method before I installed ubuntu many times. But now I can not boot acronis backup tools with my flash and I get this message:\nRemove disks or other media\nPress any key to restart\n\nI think this is because of ubuntu installed on my D drive (I have only 2 partitions). Any ideas on how to restore my acronis windows backups when ubuntu is installed?\n\nA: I used Acronis as well.  It doesn't have a problem doing drive backups and restorations when you have Linux installed.\nIn fact their CD version will backup the entire disk and it uses Linux to do that.  You could also use a awesome whole disk backup solution that is free called clonezilla.  I realize that doesn't do backups while you are using your system though like Acronis, but it does great otherwise.\nYour flash drive might just be corrupted.  Ubuntu will not effect booting into your Flash drive AT ALL.\nIf you hit the proper bios key you can boot directly to that device.  Once you do so if it doesn't load Acronis you might wanna try reinstalling on that device by first wiping it to FAT and then reinstalling.  Or if you have the option to just burn a CD you could do that as well.\nOr if you don't want to fuss with it just install clonezilla it does the same thing and can backup partitions to image files and can restore them to disk, or even different disks.\n", "Q: ufw not securing ports I have configured ufw in the manner below.

To do this, go to terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and run:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireshark-dev/stable\n\nStep 2: Update the repository:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nStep 3: Install wireshark 2.0:\nsudo apt-get install wireshark\n\nStep 4: Run wireshark:\nsudo wireshark\n\nIf you get a error couldn't run /usr/bin/dumpcap in child process: Permission Denied. go to the terminal again and run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common\n\nSay YES to the message box. This adds a wireshark group. Then add user to the group by typing\nsudo adduser $USER wireshark\n\nThen restart your machine and open wireshark. It works.

As per the requests on your comments and answer, here's more details :\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to check the existence of the old string and replace it with the new string if it exists.\n\n*I want to add the new string in a new line at the end of the txt file if the old string does not exist\n\n*If there are multiple occurances of the same string, it would be an error since its a config file.The other occurances can be removed after replacing the first occurance.\n\n\nA: This should achieve what is required:\ngrep -q \"oldstring\" test.txt\nif [ $? -eq 1 ]; then\n    echo \"newstring\" >> test.txt\nelse\n    sed -i 's/oldstring/newstring/g' test.txt\nfi\n\n\nA: One way to do this it to bring grep into the equation. First check whether the file contains the string with a quick grep and then append or substitute accordingly:\ngrep -q string file && \n    sed -i 's/string/newstring/' file || echo \"newstring\" >> file\n\nThe above is a shorthand way of writing:\nif grep -q string file; then \n    sed -i 's/string/newstring/' file\nelse\n    echo \"newstring\" >> file\nfi\n\nPersonally, however, I would use perl for this instead. Just read the file once and set a variable to 1 if the substitution was made. Then, at the end, add the string if the variable is not 1:\nperl -lpe '$i=1 if s/oldstring/newstring/; \n           END{print \"newstring\" if $i!=1;}' file > tmpfile && mv tmpfile file\n\n\nA: Using AWK:\n<<<\"$(<in)\" awk '{if(/foo/){x=sub(/foo/, \"bar\", $0)};print}END{if(x!=1){print \"bar\"}}' >in\n\n% cat in1\nstring oldstring string\n% cat in2\nstring foo string\n% <<<\"$(<in1)\" awk '{if(/oldstring/){x=sub(/oldstring/, \"newstring\", $0)};print}END{if(x!=1){print \"newstring\"}}' >in1\nuser@user-X550CL ~/tmp % cat in1\nstring newstring string\n% <<<\"$(<in2)\" awk '{if(/oldstring/){x=sub(/oldstring/, \"newstring\", $0)};print}END{if(x!=1){print \"newstring\"}}' >in2\n% cat in2\nstring foo string\nnewstring\n\n", "Q: How to show what the /bin directory does using examples?

Applications such as Thinkfan and fancontrol are removed.\nThe bios's configuration for Power management offers separate settings for mains- and battery-powered use viz. either max-performance, balanced or low-power/battery. 'Balanced' makes a compromise between performance and quietness.\nSet for 'max-performance' and powered from the mains-supply, running the Unixbench test and logging using Psensor (sample ever 1sec, log every 2secs) the 'highest-loading area' example in my log file was:\n...\n2963,94,0,65,0,64,0,64,0,4464,0,5,0,34,7,\n2968,88,0,95,0,87,0,95,0,4051,0,89,8,34,4,\n2973,94,0,97,0,89,0,97,0,3893,0,91,9,34,5,\n2978,,95,0,88,0,95,0,3889,0,92,0,34,4,\n...\n\nThe above part-result were somewhere in the '4 x pip' tests (circa 20+ minutes in). System monitor indicated 4 x 100% uP cyclic loading of ca. 15 seconds flat-out and then down for 3 - 4 secs. Room (ambient) temperature was 22C (72F).\nWARNING: Thankfully Unixbench can be immediately stopped with CTRL-C. My fan/heatsink is 'clean' and I guess makes a good thermal-contact. If this was NOT so then temperatures could well rise exceedingly fast even when the fan is running flat out. Please do not underestimate dust etc. blocking air-paths and poorly fitted/contacting heatsinks (eg. following a repair, etc). When testing, watch temperatures and be ready with CTRL-C!\nPS.

The main problem I'm having at the moment is connecting to my home network. \nI'm currently using a nano wireless usb WiFi adapter that came with a raspberry pi kit to get a connection. The only trouble is my router is failing to pick it up. When I boot the server, network connection will fail and it will generate a link-local ipv6 address. The weird thing is that after about half an hour or so the router then decides to pick up the adapter and assign it an ipv4 address. In this state I can SSH to the server but with download speeds of about 12Mb/sec (I used speedtest package to find this out) though it definitely seems slower when downloading packages in the region of about 100KB a sec. \nMy adapter can listen and pick up a whole bunch of networks fine when I use the command sudo iwlist wlan0 scan. I've edited the /etc/network/interfaces file to include my wireless adapter and use dhcp to assign an address. It currently looks like this\nauto wlan0 \niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-ssid \"router ssid\" \nwpa-psk \"password\" \n\nAnyone any idea why it isnt connecting immediately on boot or why the connection is flaky?\nThanks in advance for your advice/help.\n\nA: Got it to work by statically assigning the ip address by editing the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.150\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\nwpa-ssid \nwpa-psk \ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\nFor some reason the DHCP discover process from my Wifi adapter is ignored by my router. I had to statically assign it outside of the DHCP scope the router uses and it works straight off the bat from boot. \nall credit goes to this link. \nUbuntu 14.04 Server - WiFi WPA2 Personal\n", "Q: ampersand in web adress Using Ubuntu 14.04, if I want to run for example: system(\"firefox http://example.com/123&456\"), firefox only opens http://example.com/123. How can I get it to open the full address?\n\nA: As per the URI syntax, a web address cannot contain an ampersand. An ampersand does, however, signify the start of a query. Therefore, Firefox will try to retrieve the resource called 123 with the query 456.\n\nA: The ampersand is used to separate commands in batch. You can escape it using \\ in front of the command, which would result in system(\"firefox http://example.com/123\\&456\").\nHope that helps\n\nA: Problem solved: in order for the termninal to not break, you have to escape the ampersand by putting the web address in single quotes: system(\"firefox 'http://example.com/123&456'\")\nThe same goes for direct terminal commands: alexander@myUbuntu:~$ firefox 'http://example.com/123&456'\n", "Q: Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) dual booting issues I have a HP envy 15-j048tx laptop with UEFI on which I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS alongside Windows 10.\nI have read  this as well as this,but I don't seem to understand from a UEFI settings perspective.\nThe first picture shows the current UEFI settings. \nAs you can see Ubuntu does not detect Windows 10 and does not even allow me to install it on a different 100 GB partition which I created using the Disk Management utility.\nIf I choose the option \"Something Else\" Ubuntu does not \"See\" the partition that I created on Windows.\nSo far I have tried disabling secure boot in UEFI and disabling fast start up and shutting it down.\n\n\nA: First boot in to Windows 10, and open disk management and check whether the partitions are dynamic. Linux cannot be installed on a dynamic disk. (Screenshot would help)\nThen check whether you have a EFI partition (vFat) around 100mb. That means you installed Windows in EFI mode.\nIf the Windows installtion is EFI, then you should also boot your Ubuntu Live Media in EFI mode, if not the legacy bios mode.\nThen continue with the Ubuntu installtion as usual.\nREFERENCES:\nDecide whether you want to install in UEFI mode or Bios mode.\n\nA: Some partitions may still to be mounted because Windows seems to be in hibernation mode.  \nSo you first have to boot into Windows and disable hibernation and Fast Boot in Windows.  \nOpen command prompt as administrator and execute :  \npowercfg /h off  \n\nThen open the the old version (not the modern) of Windows Control Panel.  \nSelect Energy Settings - enable show hidden settings - uncheck Fast Boot.  \nAfter having done this - shutdown the machine completely - do NOT reboot !  \nStart the computer and select the UEFI Ubuntu USB drive option to boot from.  \nSelect Try Ubuntu without installing - start the installer - choose Something else.  \nInstall Ubuntu to the unallocated (free) space which you created in Windows before.  \nAfter installation is finished, boot into BIOS and select Ubuntu to be the default OS.\n\nA: cl-netbox and reversiblean have both provided useful suggestions. Some more points I'd like to make:\n\n\n*\n\n*You may want to read my page on installing Linux on EFI systems, which provides general tips on how to install Linux on EFI-based systems\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n*Most people report that the \"Install Alongside\" option is absent on EFI-based systems. I don't know the cause. (It could be the hibernation and Fast Startup issues that cl-netbox describes; I've never looked into it.) In any event, you may need to use the \"Something Else\" option, as described here, among other places.\n\n*If you get to the \"Something Else\" option and it shows that the disk is blank (unpartitioned), when in fact you know it contains partitions, then that indicates a problem with the partition table. There can be many causes for this problem, so I'm reluctant to offer advice without more information. Showing the output of sudo parted -l, sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda, sudo sgdisk -v /dev/sda, and sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda may be helpful.

In Ubuntu a present or a missing leading \"*\" is irrelevant, however the previous statement is not correct: see Louis Matthijssen's answer for an explanation of the difference between a missing and a present leading \"*\".\nThe filename is a filesystem metadata and has nothing to do with the \"raw\" file, which is the only thing really checked (and really relevant) when checking the MD5 sum of a file;\nYou could rename your ISO foo.iso and its MD5 sum would still match b89cd1cee3acc2ec174f8d995bd74794, which means that the file matches the expected MD5 sum.\n", "Q: USB startup disk wont show in BIOS I cannot install Ubuntu since the USB start up volume will not show in BIOS as a bootable device.\nI have Tails on a different USB drive and that works just fine.\nI have tried creating the startup volume using\n1.

Okay, so allow me to be the first to point out that I know little to nothing about Ubuntu. I own a HP Pavilion with Windows 10. My dad made me a Boot CD of Ubuntu 15.10 which installed dual-boot without a problem. I used it happily for about two weeks before I broke it.\nI was trying to watch Amazon Instant Video on my laptop last night. For the life of me, I couldn't get the thing to load on Ubuntu, so I switched the laptop off, restarted it and spammed the esc key, as well as a few others, until Windows loaded again.\nI should probably also point out: Since installing Ubuntu, my laptop has always automatically booted up to it. I've never encountered a start-up screen (GRUB?) asking me which OS I'd like to boot. I didn't even realize that this wasn't strictly normal until today.\nSo I watched my Amazon Videos, went to sleep, woke up, and I wanted to go back to Ubuntu. This is where I'm stuck, because I don't have a GRUB, and the only things I have in my Boot Device Manager are two 'OS Boot Managers' and one 'Boot from EFI File' which, frankly, seems to just be a lot of empty folders. Not a clue what it is. Both 'OS Boot Managers' lead to Windows 10. Esc leads to Windows 10. I cannot escape Windows 10.\nDisk back in the laptop, I get the option to Boot from CD/DVD. This brings me to the screen I saw when I first installed Ubuntu. It has the options to Install Ubuntu, or Try without Installing. I try installing again, but it's already installed, so no dice there. \nAlso, at some point, my laptop flipped out and had to fix disk problems. I think I'm stressing it out. It's stressing me out, too. I just want to get back to Ubuntu. Help?

The installation went well without any issues. \nWhen I switch my laptop ON, it opens the GRUB menu with : \n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu\n\n*Advanced options for Ubuntu\n\n*Windows 8 (loader) (on  /dev/sda1)\n\n\nUbuntu loads without any issue but, when I select Windows 8 I constantly come back to the GRUB menu. \nI reinstalled GRUB but nothing changes. \nI checked in BIOS and found that the boot mode is LEGACY.

Any suggestion to fix this? \nHere is the pastebin : http://paste.ubuntu.com/13397045/ \nThanks a lot for any help\nBest\n\nA: Here are some key points (out of order) from your Boot Repair output:\n/dev/sda1    *          2,048   669,571,071   669,569,024   7 NTFS / exFAT / HPFS\n\nIn other words, Windows is on /dev/sda1. There are other lines that confirm this, including the next ones, which are important for other reasons....\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Grub2 (v1.99-2.00)\n\nIn other words, GRUB is installed in the boot sector of /dev/sda1, your Windows partition. This is highly irregular at best, and really is the source of the problem; but to complete the loop, as it were....\nmenuentry 'Windows 8 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-chain-B6F60302F602C29B' {\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ntfs\n    set root='hd0,msdos1'\n\nThis fragment of your GRUB configuration confirms that GRUB is trying to launch the boot loader on /dev/sda1 (hd0,msdos1 in GRUB-speak) for Windows. Ordinarily this would work, but because that partition holds GRUB instead of the Windows boot loader, you end up in the endless loop you describe.\nChances are this problem arose because you told Ubuntu to install GRUB to /dev/sda1 at some point. This was a mistake, but if you did this through the Ubuntu installer, it's arguably a bug that the installer accepted this location, which it could (and arguably should) detect as an invalid option and refuse to accept, or at least warn you of the danger. If you think this is what happened, you should probably file a bug report to encourage changes that would prevent this sort of thing from happening to others (or to yourself!) in the future.\nAs to fixing it, I'm afraid that you'll have to use Windows tools for this job. I'm not an expert on repairing Windows in this way, so unless somebody else chimes in with details, you may do well to post to a Windows forum. The key is that you need to restore the Partition Boot Record (PBR) for the first partition. Ideally, you do not want to touch the Master Boot Record (MBR); however, there's a good chance that your Windows repair will replace the MBR as well as the PBR. If this happens, you'll need to run Boot Repair again to re-install GRUB to the MBR.\n", "Q: [UEFI][GRUB] Boot repair keeps adding MokManager.efi to boot menu I had trouble installing Arch along with Ubuntu (it didn't load the FAT32 esp). I ran boot-repair thinking that it could solve the problem. \nBut it added MokManager.efi to the list of grub boot menu. \nHere's what I did -\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatted the Arch partition.\n\n*Created a backup of my /boot partition.\n\n*Deleted all stuff from /boot/efi.\n\n*Placed the memtest86+, config, System.map, initrd and vmlinuz files in both, /boot and /boot/efi of the FAT32 boot partition.\n\n*checked the updated the /etc/grub.d/25_custom file by removing the MokManager entries.\n\n*Ran update-grub\n\n*Ran boot-repair again\n\n\nBut for some reason boot-repair again added MokManager.efi files to the /boot/efi/ubuntu and /boot/efi/efi/ubuntu folders. I am also not sure why it keeps making an efi folder in /boot/efi. But it comes up again on the next boot-repair.\nI could just backup my home folder and reinstall the whole thing, but I don't understand where the MokManager files keep propping up from. Any idea about this?\n\nA: First, know that MokManager.efi is a tool for managing Machine Owner Keys (MOKs), which are Secure Boot keys used by Shim to enable you to boot OSes of your choice when Secure Boot is active. If Secure Boot is active on your computer, you probably should have MokManager installed and accessible from GRUB, so that you can boot emergency tools of your choice should the need arise. If Secure Boot is inactive or unsupported on your computer, MokManager is dead weight -- but it's not a lot of dead weight, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. (You'll find far more useless cruft in any out-of-the-box Linux distribution, and few people go digging through all those files to clean it out.)\nThat said, my guess is that Boot Repair is finding the MokManager.efi binary in files installed from the shim package. Specifically, the file is /usr/lib/shim/MokManager.efi.signed (it's renamed to omit the .signed extension when it's copied to the ESP). If you really don't need Secure Boot, you could try removing that package -- but other packages may depend on it, so you may need to remove more than just that one. OTOH, if you're running Boot Repair from a live CD, it's conceivable that it's pulling MokManager from there rather than from your regular installation, so removing the files from your regular installation may be ineffective. For similar reasons, editing your local GRUB configuration files might not do much good.\n\nPlaced the memtest86+, config, System.map, initrd and vmlinuz files in both, /boot and /boot/efi of the FAT32 boot partition.\n\nThe \"FAT32 boot partition\" is known as the EFI System Partition (ESP). If you're using GRUB, there's no need to copy most of those files to the ESP, and certainly not to the boot or boot/efi directory on that partition. Neither of those directories exists by default on the ESP. Note, though, that the ESP is normally mounted at /boot/efi, so from your description, you may have copied those files to /boot in your normal Ubuntu distribution and/or to the root of the ESP. (It's critical to understand mount points when dealing with the ESP. The EFI may see a file as fs0:\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi, but that file would likely be /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi in Ubuntu. You \"erase\" the mount point from the complete Ubuntu file path to determine where the file is on the partition itself. The EFI has no idea of what the Ubuntu mount point is, and so accesses the file without using the Ubuntu mount point.)\nOf those files, most of them belong in the Ubuntu /boot directory, which is not on the ESP. (In some cases, /boot is a separate partition itself.) Various memtest86+* files should go in /boot, too, placed there automatically by the memtest86+ package. There should be no need to adjust any of these. If you've been copying those files to achieve some specific goal, perhaps you should share that goal, since it's unlikely that you're doing the right thing unless you've omitted some critical details (such as if you're planning to use gummiboot/systemd-boot on your computer).\nGenerally speaking, all of this stuff should Just Work. If it's not working, then something is wrong, and the actions you've described are unlikely to help, so knowing what's wrong is critical for helping you. If you simply want to remove MokManager from your GRUB menu, I recommend you not bother -- and if you insist on trying, copying your kernel and other files will not help; you need to adjust the GRUB configuration files and run update-grub. (I'm afraid I don't know precisely what you'd do to remove MokManager.) Alternatively, you could switch from GRUB to any of the several other EFI boot loaders for Linux.\n", "Q: display menu doesn't show all options I'm using two displays and for some reason I don't have the entire display menu.

The part in curly braces is using parameter expansion to remove the .avi part of the file name. For example, if an avi file is named dog.avi, then the output will be named dog.webm. If you simply use \"$file.webm\" for the output, then the output would end up as dog.avi.webm.\nWhat to customize:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can add any ffmpeg options as usual.\n\n*The %. part should use the same extension as in the for file in section, or you could change %.avi to %.* as a wildcard.\n\n*.webm can be changed to whatever output container format you need.\nIf you want the new files to be outputted to a directory named newvids, then make the new directory and change the command to: \"newvids/${file%.avi}.webm\"\ndone\nThis tells the loop that the command has finished, and now $file can refer to the next avi.\n", "Q: How to install Concorde in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS? I need to install a TCP solver called Concorde, I see in its download page the option for Red Hat Linux. \nHow could I install the program in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: There are only executable versions of Concorde and Linkern, not less, not more.\nCompile your own version:\nmkdir -p ~/src\ncd ~/src\nwget http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/codes/src/co031219.tgz\ntar xf co031219.tgz\ncd co031219\n./configure\nmake\n\nThere is no rule to install (make install).

To\n  test the concorde solver run \"concorde -s 99 -k 100\" (this should\n  generate and solve a random geometric TSP on 100 points).#\n\nSource\n\nA: The instructions by @A.B. above are correct, but they do not include a description of how to install an LP solver. An LP solver is necessary to solve the TSP exactly using concorde.\nTo install an LP solver on Ubuntu, download the BETA version of qsopt from here: http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/qsopt/beta/index.html (all the files listed under Red Hat Linux, gcc 3.4.3 (AMD 64-bit)) and put them in a directory on your machine. Then go to the unzipped concorde folder and run ./configure --with-qsopt=<full path to qsopt files> making sure NOT to include a trailing / after the full path.\nNext just run make. After that, cd into TSP and try running ./concorde -s 99 -k 100\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Change default size of terminal Running uBuntu 14.04 LTS.

THE GEAR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Midtower running Ubuntu 14.04 for the host\n\n*An HP t610 Thin Client running a stripped-down embedded copy of  Windows 7 and VMWare.

I disconnected the thin client and brought the Ubuntu tower back into my music studio.  YES - It is horrifically loud (the catalyst for this entire project), but I was stunned by the improved image clarity on my desktop.  Furthermore, eliminating the client instantly restored the function of my DAC and my connection speed increased from 25Mbps to 57.96Mbps with this one simple change.\nIt appears the best course of action in my particular scenario is to eliminate thin clients from the formula. Instead, I can drill a hole in the floor for the cables and set the tower up in the room below the studio where it can make all the noise it wants without interfering with my work.\nAt worst I'll have to buy a few cable extensions - pennies compared to what I'll get back once I sell off the client.\nThank you, dear.  Case closed.\n\nA: The only remote server/client I didn't see in your list is x2go. \nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/x2go-server-ubuntu-14-04/\n\nA: NoMachine here. Make sure you are using version 5.0.47. \nEssentially there are two problems being described.\n1) USB redirection not working in user's set up. We've checked this and can't reproduce it. The problem described was fixed a while back, so you should check that you are using the latest version. Still, it would be interesting to know the exact version that you have installed on the server and clients sides. Additionally, tell us:\n\n\n*\n\n*are the local and remote devices visible on the device list during forwarding?\n\n*is the device connected (green dot in NoMachine menu) and can you see it in the USB list on Ubuntu (lsusb command from console)?\n\n\n2) A display problem. To help us investigate further, we need to know if it’s headless setup (see here for more info: https://www.nomachine.com/AR10K00710). If it is, does it have a graphics card installed? And what the model is, if so?\nThanks.\n", "Q: Always Problems Killing Programs I always have problems killing programs. It's so frustrating. Look at this example below.

The camcorder I am using is the Sony CCD-TRV16 NTSC 180x Digital Zoom. I am using the Hauppauge 610 USB-Live 2 Analog Video Digitizer and Video Capture Device to convert 8mm tapes to mp4. I am using VLC to convert the videos.\nI will be converting quite a few tapes. It would be nice to have my exact same VLC GUI settings I use in a command or script. Also the ability to cut off recording after a certain time period would be great. I do not care what program I use to convert these. This customer said they were able to successfully use ffmpeg. However, I am fine with using any program that works. Much thanks in advance!\nHere is the output of ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video0 -f alsa -i hw:2,0.\nInput #0, video4linux2,v4l2, from '/dev/video0':\n  Duration: N/A, start: 8535.656468, bitrate: 165722 kb/s\n    Stream #0:0: Video: rawvideo (YUY2 / 0x32595559), yuyv422, 720x480, 165722 kb/s, 29.97 fps, 29.97 tbr, 1000k tbn, 1000k tbc\nGuessed Channel Layout for  Input Stream #1.0 : stereo\nInput #1, alsa, from 'hw:2,0':\n  Duration: N/A, start: 1450034548.361553, bitrate: 1536 kb/s\n    Stream #1:0: Audio: pcm_s16le, 48000 Hz, 2 channels, s16, 1536 kb/s\n\n\nA: Preliminary Steps\nLaunch VLC with vlc -vvv. This turns on verbosity to 2 (debug). This can also be seen in VLC GUI by going to Tools > Messages. Then follow the steps listed above in the screen shots to display the needed information for the command in the debug log. Then you can adjust the appropriate syntax by looking at the script below and online. You can also see the code and syntax by selecting Show more options. (The first screenshot in my question above.) However, this is only how I was able to create the cvlc command below. You may simply want to adjust the below script to your needs.\nInitially, I was unable to get the audio to work with the one RCA audio port on my camcorder. I fixed this by going to Tools > Preferences > All (radio button, bottom left). Then I went to Input / Codecs > Access modules > ALSA. I changed the Sample rate to 48000 Hz. After changing this setting you will be able to stream your video. The other sample rates were causing an error.\nGo to Media > Open Capture Device. Select Video device name and Audio device name (note that in the screen shot above it is default because I was using the microphone port instead. Yours will be different if you're using the RCA connection on your Hauppauge device.) Select NTSC (or whatever format your video tapes are). Click Play. While playing, go to Tools > Codec Information. You will want to adjust the below script according to the information given there. I adjusted the frame rate to 29.97 and sample rate to 48000 Hz. in my script because of the information given there. \nAbout the Script\na. You are prompted to input the filename and metadata. Files are set to save to ~/Videos.\nb. VLC (cvlc)\n\n\n*\n\n*I set the timeout to 122 minutes because my 8mm tapes are two hours. The --foreground option allows you to hit 'ctrl c,' and it will stop only this portion of the script and continue to the next part. (Some videos I have are shorter.)\n\n*You can use VLC GUI to find the audio and video device names. (See the above screenshot.) \n\n*Know whether your video is NTSC or another format. \n\n*vcodec and acodec are set set to mpeg2 and mpga. The Amazon product page for the Hauppauge 610 states that it encodes to MPEG-2. \n\n*For MPEG-2, VLC GUI only gave the option for .ts format. (See second screenshot above.) Therefore I am using mux=ts. Initially I was using vcodec=h264 acodec=mpga and mux=mp4. However, there were audio sync issues and the sound would drop out at certain places in the video. Also see the mux= section here.  \n\n*I needed samplerate=48000 for it to work. \n\n*The frames per second given on the Codec Information were 29.97. This is standard for VHS / 8mm tapes. Therefore, I decided to match it. \n\n*I chose to deinterlace. I thought this looked better. \n\n*Using mux=ts will create a large file. My two hour videos are 5-7 GB.\n\n\nc. FFmpeg compresses further with libx264 (from about 5 GB to about 1.5 GB) and adds in the metadata. There were additional handwritten notes about each 8mm tape and I wanted to include this additional information with the file. In the same command, FFmpeg moves left channel audio from only left to both left and right channels as a stream copy with no additional audio compression. My camcorder has only one RCA audio port. So this fixes the one speaker issue. Thanks to mondaugen for their answer on the one-channel audio issue.  \nd. Lastly, you are notified when the script finishes. For my personal script, I am actually using the following instead. \nOn my computer: \nexo-open --launch WebBrowser $HOME/Videos/video-finished.htm\n\nFile contains: <p style=\"font-size: 128px; color: green; font-family: sans; text-align: center; margin-top: 10%; font-weight: bold;\">VIDEO FINISHED</p>\nOn my phone:\nYou can install gcalcli to receive a notification on your phone via Google Calendar when the script completes. Below, the date and time for two minutes in the future is put into a variable. Then a calendar entry is created for that time. A reminder is set for the start of that event. Google Calendar needs a two minute buffer. (I tried one minute.) So, you would be notified two minutes after the encode finishes. \nnew_date=`date --date=\"2min\"`\ngcalcli --calendar 'Name of Your Calendar' --title 'Video Finished' --where '' --when \\'\"$new_date\"\\' --duration 5 --description '' --reminder 0 add\n\nEnd Product\nThe final result produces the larger .ts file and a further compressed .mp4. \nCPU Usage\nI have an AMD A8-6500B processor. cvlc runs at about 15% cpu usage. However, ffmpeg was running at about 97%. Therefore, in my script (not in the one below), I added the -threads 3 option to keep CPU usage at an overall 75%. I am able to do this because my processor is quad core.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Name:         Hauppauge 610 USB-Live 2 Analog Video Digitizer and Video Capture Device Conversion Script\n# Author:       jbrock\n# Dependencies: VLC media player; ffmpeg, in Ubuntu you will need to add a ppa to install.  \n# License:      GNU GPLv3 (http://www.gnu.de/documents/gpl-3.0.en.html)\n# Usage:        Digitize analog tapes to .ts format.

May be useful if your content is noisy, but too much denoising will cause obvious blurriness, and this filter may be slow.\n\n*The format filter will ensure a chroma subsampling scheme that is widely compatible. Otherwise, ffmpeg will assume you want to avoid or minimize chroma subsampling and the output may not be playable by non-FFmpeg based players like QuickTime.\n\n*-movflags +faststart will move some data after encoding is complete from the end of the file to the beginning. This allows playback to begin before the file is completely downloaded if your viewers are watching via progressive download.\n\n*You can add -metadata title=\"Title\" and other metadata if you feel like it.\nCutting out the extra junk\nAfter watching the output and you want trim it, getting rid of any blue or black blank video for example, you can just re-mux without re-encoding. This will skip the first 10 seconds and make an output 600 seconds (10 minutes) long. It may not be frame exact, but it will probably be close enough.\nffmpeg -ss 10 -i input -c copy -t 600 output\n\n\nA: I was also using a variation on the ffmpeg method when I first got this hardware, but I observed that vlc's default transcode gave better visual results on my system than ffmpeg, so I goofed about with the vlc command line (cvlc) and figured out the command line to request what the GUI example above is doing.\ncvlc  v4l2:///dev/video1:standard=NTSC :input-slave=alsa://hw:3,0 :live-caching=1000 --sout \"#transcode{vcodec=h264,acodec=mpga,vb=3000,fps=29.97,ab=128,audio-sync,channels=2,deinterlace}:file{dst=rec122015.mp4,no-overwrite}\" --sout-keep\n\n", "Q: How would another user reach your home directory using a relative path from his own home directory?

You have a Downloads directory.  The files and directory names in Linux are case sensitive.  Those are two different directory names.  You can have two different folders by those names on Linux, but they would be the same directory in Windows.\nAlso, in the future when you have a problem copy exactly what you type and the exact error message and paste it to your question.  This would make it easier for the community to see the exact problem.\nPlease, also consider formatting your quoted text with a one of the formatting provisions such as the '' or the {} tools above.  You can do this by highlighting the text you want formatted then clicking on one of the markdown links.\n\nDetailed explanation of the specific errors\nAfter the reformatted text of your question it's clear that you have two errors.  One of your errors is the misspelling of your downloads folder name.  You specified \"downloads\" where no folder or file by that name exist.  It should have been Downloads (with the capital D).  The first of your two errors is saying you don't have a \"downloads\" folder.\nThe second of your two errors is that you have a space in your pathname.  The space is indicating that you are trying to copy two files, one called /home/kevsfernandez/downloads and one called ‘john-1.7.9.tar.gz’ to your /opt/ folder.\nWhen you specify more than one two arguments, all except the last argument is a list of files to be copied to the last argument.\nThe answer I gave above resolves the problem.\n", "Q: Error, pkgProblemResolver when trying to install PCSX2 emulator - Unmet Dependencies? I am running a x64bit laptop with Ubuntu 14.04(trusty tahr). I am wanting to install the PCSX2 emulator, to run my PS2 rom-game. I have tried countless things to make this work, but to no success.\nRepository: ppa:gregory-hainaut/pcsx2.official.ppa\n\nInput: sudo apt-get install pcsx2-unstable\n\nOutput: http://pastebin.com/fLCaLweY\n\nI have no idea how I am going to fix this. Can someone please help?\nThank you.\nP.S: If there's anything I can post here, that will help you guys 'solve this', please just let me know and I'll provide it.\n\nA: Try using \n$sudo apt-get autoremove\n$sudo apt-get update\n$sudo apt-get upgrade\n$sudo apt-get -f install\nThis will use apt-get to try to find and fix any unmet dependencies this works in most cases. If apt-get still can not get the needed dependencies you might have to go and find them manually.\nAlso you always need to run a sudo apt-get update and upgrade after adding a ppa. Did you do this? Let me know if this still doesn't fix it. I can try it out in a virtual machine later.\n\nA: PCSX2 can only be compiled for 32bit processors, but you are using 64bit system. PCSX2 requires some 32bit libraries to be installed, but since they would probably need to replace 64bit ones that are needed on your system, it throws error.\nThere are generally 3 ways how to install PCSX2 on Linux.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to install 32bit libraries on 64bit system\nThis is what you tried to do. It works for some people, but it never worked for me since I always needed some 64bit library that couldn't be installed together with it's 32bit version.\n\n*Install PCSX2 in 32bit chroot on your 64bit system\nThis is the cleanest solution since it doesn't pollute your 64bit system with 32bit libraries. This will in very simple words install 32bit system to a folder on your 64bit system, and any application that will be run from there will use 32bit libraries. This cleanly separates 64bit and 32bit system, so there are not any conflicts.\nAnother good thing is that chroot is not emulation, so there is not any noticeable slowdown.\nIf you are interested, here is link to my how-to that was created when I had the same problem.\nhttps://jirka642.wordpress.com/2016/02/04/installing-pcsx2-on-64bit-linux/\n\n*Reinstall and use 32bit Linux\nYou should probably only try this if everything else fails, since who wants to use 32bit system on modern PC?\n", "Q: Partition recognized as unusable during ubuntu installation I want to dual boot windows 7 with ubuntu but during installing ubuntu shows the partition i created for ubuntu in windows as unusable.Basically i have 3 partition and one system reserved.\nPartition C - where all program files are present.\nPartition D - where my movies and songs are present\nPartition E - where i store office document.enter image description here\nAnd one partition is system reserved which was created when i removed windows 8 and installed windows 7.\nSo when i create a free space partition for ubuntu it recognize it as unusable.enter image description here\n\n\n*\n\n*Before this problem\nAfter installing win7 over win8 i tried to install ubuntu but at that ubuntu was unable to recognize any of my partition instead showing only one single partition.Later on i found out it was some Gpt-MBR problem.\nSo i used Fixpart to fix that problem.and it was fixed.\n\n\nA: First, be aware that you did something very dangerous: You should NEVER use Windows' own partitioning tool to create partition(s) for Linux. NEVER. The Windows tools have known bugs that cause all manner of problems, particularly when increasing the number of partitions beyond four on a Master Boot Record (MBR) disk, which you have. Fortunately, you don't seem to have run into these problems. I'm leading with this point because I don't want you, or somebody else who reads this, to make that mistake. It's OK to use the Windows tools to shrink an existing partition, but that's it.\nSecond, the screen shots to which you've linked do not show five partitions; they show four partitions and unallocated space between two of those partitions. The GUIs are easy to misinterpret. With that in mind, you should also know that MBR supports a maximum of four primary partitions, which is what you've got. That's why GParted identifies the unallocated space as \"unusable\" -- it literally cannot be carved up into additional partitions, because you've already used your four primary partition slots.\nNote the qualifier word primary. MBR also supports logical partitions, but they must exist within a special type of primary partition known as an extended partition. Thus, when you need more than four partitions, the usual solution is to make at most three primary partitions, one extended partition, and as many logical partitions as you need. The trick in your case is that you've already got four primary partitions, so you can't create the extended partition that you need to create your logical partitions. There are ways around this dilemma, but the best way to proceed depends on how you're using those partitions.\nI note that GParted seems not to have fully identified /dev/sda4 -- GParted says that it's NTFS, but says the amount of used space is \"unknown.\" If you created /dev/sda4 in Windows for Linux's use, one approach is to delete it and create an extended partition in its place. The trouble with this approach is that if you delete /dev/sda4, you'll have two areas of unused space, and you can create just one extended partition. Thus, you must either convert /dev/sda3 into a logical partition or move it to the left so that you'll have one big area of contiguous free space for your extended partition. If /dev/sda3 is not a boot disk, then converting it to a logical partition should work. (Windows can boot only from primary partitions, so you should not convert /dev/sda3 to logical form if you're booting from it.) Moving the partition may be time-consuming, and imposes a risk of data loss, but may be an acceptable solution if you've got a good backup.\nAnother solution (which overlaps with the preceding one) is to convert one or more of your existing partitions from primary to logical form. You can do this with my FixParts program, which comes in the gdisk package in Ubuntu. You should definitely be able to convert /dev/sda3 from primary to logical form with FixParts, and you might be able to convert other partitions, too. DO NOT convert your Windows boot partition, though. Once you convert partition(s) from primary to logical form, you can use GParted to adjust the size of the extended partition and create new logical partitions for use by Ubuntu. (Unlike Windows, Ubuntu has no problems booting from a logical partition.) Unfortunately, I can't be very specific about what to convert in this scenario, since I don't know enough about what each of your partitions does. I recommend you read the FixParts documentation, identify your existing partitions' functions, and if necessary ask more questions before proceeding. If you go this route, you'll probably end up using at least two partitioning tools (FixParts and GParted), and maybe more (the Windows tool may be slightly safer than GParted if you have to move or resize existing NTFS partitions).\n", "Q: How do I set uget as a startup application I want to make uget as a startup application in ubuntu.

WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. \nNext, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:\nsudo iw reg get\n\nIf you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting.

I installed VirtualBox via the download from Oracle's website. However, I'd like to get updates through the software center.\nI'm concerned that doing so will wipe out my virtual machine. Is this the case, or is it seamless?\nI'm exporting an appliance of my VM now (which I assume is a backup), but I'd like to know anyway.\nThanks.\n\nA: Re-installing VirtualBox from the software repository should not harm the VM's that you have, although the version of VirtualBox available at Oracle (5.0.10) is substantially newer than the one in the software repository (5.0.4).  I believe the program also checks on occasion for updates, although I have not run VB in quite a while.\nBackups: Always a good thing.  Do that more often.  You will find a directory in your home area, probably with a name line virtualbox.   Inside this directory, you will find all sorts of subdirectories names like your virtual machines.  These are in fact, your VMs and an adequate backup, is to backup these directories.

I do not bother with video and music (I could always re-download those but my projects are on my system, on a backup on an external medium and stored on-line at an ftp I own).\n\n\n*do not format the location you stored them. You can do that using the \"something else\" method or picking the \"replace but save my documents\" method.\nTip: I have my data on a separate partition and not in /home/ and edited  ~./config/user-dirs.dirs to point to that partition.

I created a network and my friend joined. So I hosted a game and the port was 1100, I think, but the problem is that he was able to join althrough I didn't open the port in iptables or ufw.\nIsn't that a huge security issue?\nAnd how to change this?\n\nA: That is the point of hamachi, it is supposed to allow connections without having to set up rules for each network you set up. \nIn effect it allows you to set them up as local networks. While it could be a slight security risk, as long as you don't give the network info and password out to any but your friends it is minimal as long as you trust your friends. Once you close the connection via Hamachi, afaik any security holes would close as the network would be shut down. \n\nAs to any viruses infecting your friends computer affecting yours(as raised in your comments): \nMaybe, but I would think the risk would be minimal(your root files should still be safe, only your home would be at risk) First if your friends are using Windows, any virus that they have would be ineffective if it could even manage to get into your system- Windows and Linux work so differently that there are few, if any viruses that can effect both.\nIf your friends happen to be using Linux and they are infected there may be more risk, but when using Hamachi, you are operating as a server so the virus (more a trojan here) would have to know that 1. You were a server 2. You were connected via a Hamachi type connection and be able to break out of that connection to get back to the author.  While I suppose this is all possible, it would require a lot of work on the part of the hacker that wrote the trojan.  \nLet my pose a question here to put your mind at ease, do you think he would go to all that work to find a random host, find that host in the small window that it is open so that he could use it, just to have all that work go for naught when you shut the server down in an hour or so?  I would think he would be more likely to put his time into a more guaranteed target. \n\nThe security hole I would be worried about would be one of the friends you have connected to be actively trying to hack into your system. \nAs long as you don't give the info to anyone you don't trust or leave the connection open after you are done with it, that risk is very small- likely less that you assume when you just surf the internet at large.\n"]
