If I write an app for iOS and it's accepted by the AppStore, how do I know if the app is actually the app I compiled and has not being substituted/altered by, say, a \"Man in the middle\" style interception/attack? Is there a way to do a checksum either after the fact or from inside the app itself?\n\nA: Actually, it turns out, when backing up to iTunes, the *.ipa file is copied from the iOS device. This file is simply a *.zip with a different extension. Using a tool like 7-zip allows One to examine the contents after the back up to iTunes. A checksum can be run on the individual components in this archive, verifying a lack of tampering.\n", "Q: How do I change the Firefox 23.0 icon back to the old one?

I am able to connect just fine via the Windows application installed on another VM. I have created two OVF files, one for Server 2003 and another for Server 2012. Both files were created without incident. I am able to upload them to the ESXi server seemingly without issue as well.\nHowever, when I start either of the VMs, I get the following error(s):\nConsole:\n\nAnd in the GUI:\n\nI'm unsure how to proceed, as I have followed the steps outlined to create an OVF file and upload it to the ESX. Both of these VMs work fine through Fusion.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: After arduous research and trial and error, I've finally been able to solve this issue. First of all, if you're migrating Fusion VMs to ESXi, I recommend not using the OVF tool. At least for me, it never worked properly. Instead, I used the vmware-vdiskmanager tool, which is built into Fusion. The instructions for this migration are listed below:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open Terminal.\n  \n*Run the following command, inserting the correct VMWare Fusion vmdk file source and new vmdk destination: \n  \n  \n/Applications/VMware\\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmware-vdiskmanager -r /PATH/TO/vmware_fusion.vmwarevm/vmware_fusion.vmdk -t 4 /PATH/TO/esxi.vmdk\n\n  \n*The conversion process, once complete, will create two files: filename.vmdk, and filename-flat.vmdk.\n  \n*Launch the vSphere client through your web browser to your ESXi server.\n  \n*Once logged in, go to File | New | Virtual Machine.\n  \n*In the Configuration window, select Custom.\n  \n*In the Storage window, select the datastore location to store the new VM.\n  \n*In the Virtual Machine Version window, use the default option of Virtual Machine Version: 8.\n  \n*Select the desired settings for Guest OS, CPUs, Memory, Network, and SCSI Controller.\n  \n*In the Select a Disk window, choose the Do Not Create Disk option.\n  \n*Click the Finish button.\n  \n*In the ESXi server settings, select the Configuration tab then click on Storage.\n  \n*In Storage, select your datastore and right-click to select Browse Datastore.\n  \n*Select the folder name that corresponds to the new VM.\n  \n*Select the Upload button.\n  \n*Upload the filename.vmdk and filename-flat.vmdk files from Step 3.\n  \n*Once complete, you will only see the filename.vmdk file in the datastore.\n  \n*Select the VM and Edit virtual machine settings under the Get Started tab.\n  \n*Click the Add button in the Virtual Machine Properties window.\n  \n*For Device Type, select Hard Disk, and choose Use an existing virtual disk. \n  \n*Locate the datastore and select the existing disk.\n  \n*In the Advanced Options, leave the default settings.\n  \n*Select Finish and OK to close the Virtual Machine Properties.\n  \n*At this point, you should be able to boot to the newly migrated VM.\n  \n\nGuidance for this came from MacTech's June 2013 issue, reproduced at the author's blog here. Many kudos to Rich Trouton for this article.\nSome updates for vSphere Client 6.7\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 5: Go to Actions | New Virtual Machine.\n\n*Steps 6 - 9: Configure as desired.\n\n*Step 10: In the Customize hardware dialog, remove the New hard disk.\n\n*Step 12 - 13: Select storage, then Files.\n\n*Step 18: Select the VM and then Actions | Edit Settings....\n\n*Step 19: Click the Add New Device button.\n\n*Step 20: Select Existing Hard Disk.\n\n*Step 22: Ignore.\n\n\nA: I would suggest using the VMWare converter to move the virtual machines from one host to another. This will do all the heavy lifting for you. It's free. \nhttp://www.vmware.com/products/converter/\nThis is your best option as the converter does all the vm configurations and settings for you. This is also suggested in the KB Article (1000936) from VMWare. \nYou have to do this on a windows machine. Inside a VM on the same fusion host works just fine.\n\nA: There has been an update to OVFTOOL around since March 2015 (Now V4.1.0.). With this OSX version I have much fewer trouble to get OVFTool to work. Even a OSX VM transfer from Fusion to ESXi is now just a one line like:\n/Applications/VMware\\ OVF\\ Tool/ovftool --compress=9 ./OS_X_10.vmx vi://root@ESX6i\n\nFinally it is working like expected, when the old versions just copied parts or I had to try 10 times to get the desired results with some crude workarounds.\nSo please give it another try! ;)\n", "Q: How to make a command line executable an application?

How do I do that?\n\nA: Use Automator.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and double-click on Application.\n\n*In the \"Name\" search box, type Apple and you should see \"Run AppleScript\".\n\n*Drag \"Run AppleScript\" into the right-hand window.\n\n*Where it says (* Your script goes here *), replace that text with the following code:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    do script with command \"JMeter\"\nend tell\n\n\n*File > Save and enter a name, and choose where to save the application.\n\n*Double-click on the newly created application.\n\n\nA: Short answer:\ndo shell script \"/your/script/path/shellscript.sh\"\n\nUse this snippet in an AppleScript, then save it as an application.\n\nA: Here are the commands to create a minimum version of the app which runs top command:\nAPP=Foo\nmkdir -vp ${APP}.app/Contents/MacOS ${APP}.app/Contents/Resources # Create the folders.\nPATH=\"$PATH:/usr/libexec\" # Make sure PlistBuddy is in the PATH.\nprintf '#!/usr/bin/osascript\\ntell application \"Terminal\"\\n\\tactivate\\n\\tdo script \"top\"\\nend tell\\n' > ${APP}.app/Contents/MacOS/${APP}\nchmod +x ${APP}.app/Contents/MacOS/${APP} # Sets the executable flag.\nPlistBuddy ${APP}.app/Contents/Info.plist -c \"add CFBundleDisplayName string ${APP}\"\nPlistBuddy ${APP}.app/Contents/version.plist -c \"add ProjectName string ${APP}\"\nfind ${APP}.app # Verify the files.\nopen ${APP}.app # Run the app.\n\nNote: The above commands should be executed in shell e.g. in Terminal.\nIn above code, you can replace top with your shell command.\n\nIn case, you're dealing with Windows apps, consider using WineBottler app.\n\nA: The answer that uses Automator worked for me to wrap GNumeric, but it was opening an ugly Terminal box and I could not close it without closing GNumeric, so I was able to get rid of it by changing it as follows:\ntell application \"/usr/local/bin/gnumeric\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to have different colors in each Terminal window Can I do this? \nOMG, I looked for hours, and every article I find tells me how to colorize the output of ls. Or colorize my prompt. I really really really don't want that. \nI want to colorize the text. The default text in the terminal window. \nI know I can do this from Terminal Preferences. But that applies to EVERY terminal window that's open, which I don't want. \nAs the subject says, I'd like to have three different terminal windows with three different default colors for text in them. How can I do that?\nIn Windows cmd.exe, I could run a command from the prompt: color 0xA 0xG (something like that) and it would re-colorize the basic text and background. rather that pointy-clicky inspector themes menus and all that... can I do something like this from the MacOS Terminal prompt?  \n\nA: I may not be understanding the question fully, since you change the color settings per-tab/window contrary to your question, but here is how to do what I think you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Terminal menu > Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Settings tab.\n\n*Click on the gear icon at the bottom left and choose Duplicate Settings.\n\n*Enter a name for your settings.\n\n\n*Make any changes you want to font colors.\n\n*Repeat steps 3 through 6 until you have as many sets of colors as you want.\n\n*Close the Preferences window.\n\n*Open as many tabs as you want (3, it sounds like).\n\n*Right-click on the first and choose Inspect Tab.\n\n\n*Select your desired Settings pre-set from the list. (The ones you created will be down towards the bottom.)\n\n*Close the Inspector window.\n\n*Repeat steps 9 through 11 until you have customized each tab.\n\n\nThat should be it. If you want Terminal to always open like this, with these three tabs and their associated color settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Window menu > Save Windows as Group.\n\n*Enter a name.\n\n*Click Save.\n\n*Go to Terminal menu > Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Startup tab.\n\n*Next to \"On startup, open:\" choose the radio button for \"Window group:\" and select the name of the group you created in step 2.\n\n\nA: One approach is to use an escape sequence in your prompt to colourize the text. If you don't end the prompt with the reset sequence, the colour will persist into the text you type and the output of commands (except when the output uses colour codes itself).\nThe Mac terminal supports the full 256-colour xterm escape codes (you can find a full description of them at http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html). You just need to select a colour for each session and set $PS1 to an appropriate sequence, probably in your .bashrc file.\nThis is a crude version that simply picks a random colour for each session:\ncolour=0x$(xxd -p -l 1 /dev/urandom)      # Random number from 0x00 to 0xff\n(( colour=colour ))                       # Convert to decimal\nexport PS1='\\[\\e[38;5;'$colour'm\\]\\w $ '  # Set the foreground colour\n\nYou might want to do something more sophisticated to avoid picking colours that are hard to see against your background colour.\n", "Q: Why do browsers not render pictures in native pixel density on retina display? It seems to me that browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) on my retina Macbook Pro do not render any pictures at native pixel density. For example, when I open an image from google images and then download that same image and open it in preview, that same image is smaller and more dense in Preview than it is in my browser. This seems to suggest that there is a discrepancy in pixel scaling between the two applications. Can this be fixed for the browser? \n\nA: This is intentional. Most websites aren't designed for retina displays and only have 1x assets. If these 1x assets were drawn at native resolution on a retina display, they would appear at one quarter the size (half the height, half the width). That would obviously be impractical: it would be like browsing the web with your browser's zoom level set to 25%.\nTo get around this, the browser simply draws everything at 2x (retina) by default and then upscales any 1x assets to match. This way, websites appear at the same physical size on a retina display as they do on a non-retina display.\n\nA: I think this is not a problem in the browsers themselves (at least it should not be a problem in Safari). The problem is lack of website support for HiDPI displays. I guess the majority of websites don't support Retina Displays yet. See Developing a responsive, Retina-friendly site for more info.\nIf non-retina-ready websites were rendered at Retina resolution, the images would look twice as small and the layout of the site would be broken (as non-image elements don't generally care about retina and thus would not scale).\n\nSee this Macrumors Forum thread for some websites that do support Retina Displays.\n", "Q: In iMovie 11, how do I export at my custom resolution/aspect ratio? It only allows 16:9/4:3? I see a few posts that say it will also export at the aspect ratio you imported at, but how?\nI recorded a portion of my screen with Quicktime's screen recorder, and it came to a resolution of 680x812. I imported that into iMovie, as well as a 640x812 image at the end, but when I go to export, I only get this screen, where none of them are the resolution of my video, and it puts black letterboxing on the sides:\n\nHow do I do it?\nAlso, how do I get it to not degrade video quality?\n\nA: I can address your first question. You can't export into a custom resolution. For that, you need Final Cut Pro X and Compressor. See this blog post for a description of the process.\n\n(Apple's) suggestion was to edit your video using standard video formats in FCP X, then export it to Compressor and use the Geometry tab in Compressor to create the final movie size you need.\n\n", "Q: Where is my ./configure file in OSX 10.8.4 (Mountain Lion)? I'm setting up Cap'n Pro on my Mac and the install instructions ask me to type the following in terminal:\n./configure CXX=$HOME/clang-3.2/bin/clang++\n\nI look in my user folder i.e. ~/./configure but it doesn't exist. Am I doing this right? Where is my ./configure folder? Do I need to create one? \nAlso, yes I have invisible folders visible.\n\nA: The configure script (not directory) is part of the source code archive you should have downloaded (capnproto-c++-X.Y.Z.tar.gz).\nWhen you unpack that archive, change to the toplevel directory (capnproto-X-Y-Z) and run the configure command.\n$ cd [to where you downloaded the archive]\n$ tar xzf capnproto-c++-X.Y.Z.tar.gz\n$ cd capnproto-c++-X.Y.Z\n$ ./configure CXX=$HOME/clang-3.2/bin/clang++\n\nThen run the subsequent commands (make and sudo make install) from that same directory.\nThis is rather generic - most autotool-based builds work exactly like that.\n", "Q: Update of app shown in iPhone but not in iPad? I have a first version of my app in the App Store. Recently I released the next version with some bug fixes.

Might be that Apple does this so their servers wont be overloaded when everybody updates the same app at the same time.\nYou should also check that you've released the update to all platforms, not only iPhones.\n", "Q: What is the s/mime encryption strength on iOS? I've set up S/MIME on my iPhone, but unlike other mail clients, I'm not given the option to select the hash or encryption algorithms. I assume iOS makes this decision for me.\nCan anyone tell me what algorithms are used and what the key sizes are? It would be nice to know that the NSA are going to have a hard time to break into my Facebook notifications. :D\n\nA: SHA-1 is most likely it. Here's what I've found to support that claim:\nOn the Cryptographic Message Syntax Services Reference document, it is stated that the S/MIME version used is 3.1, which is defined here and where it's stated that it supports SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 but:\n\nThe SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms [FIPS180-2] are not currently recommended in S/MIME, and are included here for completeness.\n\nEven more, on the Certificate, Key, and Trust Services Reference document (although it's the Mac version), it's stated that the default algorithm used is the SHA-1.\nIn another document, it is said:\n\nThe most common hash function you will use is SHA-1, an algorithm developed and published by the U.S. Government that produces a 160-bit hash value from any data up to 2**64 bits in length. There are also a number of more exotic algorithms such as SHA-2, elliptic-curve-based algorithms, and so on.\nFor compatibility with existing systems and infrastructure, you may occasionally need to use older algorithms such as MD5, but they are not recommended for use in new designs because of known weaknesses.\n\nSo, although I couldn't find any direct statement confirming the use of the SHA-1 algorithm, clues point in that direction.\n\nA: For a specific message, you can use openssl asn1parse to peek inside.\nI sent myself a message using iOS Mail, signed and encrypted to me, and using the command line\n$ openssl smime -pk7out -in message.eml | openssl asn1parse\n\nand the contents of the results showed the message appears to be encrypted with 3DES EDE in CBC mode:\n  913:d=5  hl=2 l=   8 prim: OBJECT            :des-ede3-cbc\n\nFinding the signature algorithm is another challenge.  I think it's SHA-1, but the decrypted message includes a lot of certificate signatures, and I'm not sure which is the message's. \n$ openssl smime -decrypt -in smime.eml -recip me.crt -inkey me.key | \\\n    openssl smime -pk7out | openssl asn1parse\n\n…\n   30:d=5  hl=2 l=   5 prim: OBJECT            :sha1\n\n\nWhile the question is actually asking about the symmetric and hash algorithm used to encrypt the message data, the parameters for the certificate itself (which contains the public key used to encrypt the symmetric key which is, in turn used to deal with the data) are selected at key generation time.  I've seen this in action while generating a new personal key pair at StartSSL; the web interface asks for the size of the RSA key and which signature algorithm I wish to use, along with the warning that choosing SHA-1 will leave you with a certificate incompatible with some systems.\nFor what it's worth, my own personal certificate uses 2048-bit RSA and the SHA-1 signature algorithm, which I've found works well across several different systems, including OS X Mail.app, iOS Mail, and Outlook 2007.\n", "Q: Is it possible to update the itunes without updating Xcode? I am having updates for both itunes and xcode in the App store.\n\nWhen I click update to itunes, it asks me to close both the itunes and xcode.\nI don't want to update xcode.\nIs it possible update the itunes without updating Xcode?\nWhat will happen if I click continue on the below image?\n\n\nA: If you have both iTunes and Xcode installed, Xcode needs to be closed to update iTunes even if Xcode itself is not getting updated. There are some dependencies between iTunes and Xcode for app provisioning and such and closing Xcode ensures that the installation will run through.\nAll that you need to do it quit iTunes and Xcode to make the update continue. Xcode will not get updated from the Store by that. \nBy the way, if you're not a developer, consider to remove Xcode from your Mac to save space and hassles.\n", "Q: iOS App Store chart position: Strange ups and downs I'm tracking (every hour) one of my client's apps which is listed in one of the category charts (not the overall charts). However I noticed strange ups and downs in the chart positions. Within only some hours the app hikes down (e.g. from place 60 to 150) and goes straight up to 60 again (I think when someone makes a download).\nIt seems like other apps surrounding the tracked one are much more constant in their positions (especially the Top 50 ones). Is there any explanation for this?\n\nA: I think you answered the question yourself. It looks like positions 60-150 for the section you are interested in are very variable due to the ranking algorithm being sensitive to very low traffic in app downloads.\nI'd guess that positions 1-50 have significantly more app download traffic, and thus they are much more stable.\n", "Q: How does iOS delete a file technically and can it potentially be undeleted? We have an interesting discussion here about file deletion on iOS devices.\nThe question was: if I delete a file using NSFileManager, what's happening under the hood?\nMy understanding is that deletion is performed by removing the corresponding file entry from the file system table.\nThe counter argument is that a file handle remains in some way and only a flag gets set which marks the file as deleted. If the user had root access to the iOS device, he could potentially reset that flag and recover the file content.\nIn both cases we agree that the actual file content will not be overwritten and the plain bytes still exist on the flash memory/disk until the block is occupied by another file.\nThe idea is now: if the second version is true, we could overwrite the file with a one byte content prior to deletion (even if that byte gets written to a new location on the flash drive without actually overwriting the old content). If then the file is recovered, only the overwritten one byte content is available.\nNote that we're not talking about forensic analysis of the flash drive which could maybe recover the original file content.\nSo to recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*How does deletion of a file on iOS work internally?\n\n*Does the overwrite approach prevent undeletion?\n\n\nA: I believe in Unix the file system is modified as you suggest (the entry is removed from the file system table). On Windows the file system table is modified, and the file is just flagged as deleted - data recovery tools can undelete the file. Having looked at Windows undelete applications I think the file name is also modified, so when undeleting, you need to supply the correct file name. Modifying the file name would mean if you created a file with the same name as the one you just deleted, the OS wouldn't have to reconcile there being two files with the same name.\nMacOSX and Windows have a trash can (recycle bin) which I think is implemented a special folder into which the deleted files are copied. When you empty the trash, this folder is purged - by modifying the system file table. If you use NSFileManager, it circumvents the trash can (which doesn't exist on iOS anyway) so it's a real delete. likewise if you \"rm\" from a terminal window. \nIf you create a new file with the same name as the old one, in Unix it's just a new entry in the system file table, but since the old entry had been removed from the table, there wouldn't be an advantage to creating the new entry.\nThat's my belief, and I'm ready for the onslaught of down votes ;-)\n", "Q: Can Apple's Earpods Be Used With Any Smartphone? Can Apple's earpods be used with any smartphone, or are they specific for the iPhone only ?\n\nA: They can be used in any device that accepts a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack (and that's pretty much anything that has a headphone socket these days, alternatives include a smaller 2.5mm jack, or a much larger 1/4\" one), although the inline controls may have limited use or operate differently depending on what you plug them into.\nAs to advanced features, this depends on a couple of things.  The socket size is the most important consideration, but the next thing is the amount of \"poles\" that the headphones have, and that the socket supports.  A \"2 pole\" device (3 separate contact areas separated by 2 solid line/band right around the jack) will provide for stereo sound (left/right/ground), adding a 3rd band/4th pole will add MIC functions and the ability to send controls from an inline controller for volume, track selection etc.  For the latter, the actual commands sent down the connection may vary per device, giving you volume on one device, or tracks on another, but there are a couple of semi-unofficial standards in that it usually works OK across devices so long as the contact is there inside the socket to support the connection.\nStandard    Tip         Ring 1          Ring 2  Sleeve          Phones using this Standard\nCTIA / AHJ  Left Audio  Right Audio     Ground  Microphone      Apple, HTC, latest Nokia, latest Samsung, latest Sony (2012+), most Android phones\n\nThis page may help if you need to read more.\n\nA: Some models of Apple earbuds or in-ears like ME186LL/A were very popular in the past, have been critically looked at and are known to work with other smartphones. I couldn't find a complete listing or offical statements of which model supports which standard or if they all follow exactly the CTIA standard, though.\nI got the earpods along with ME186LL/A and remember that the middle button was working on Android according to the Android specification. I still have the ME186LL/A which work the same way on Android and Windows Phone. In contrast Sony's MH1C have working volume buttons on generic Android devices and Windows Phone.\nOffical statements or a crowdsourced list would be really nice to have.\n\nA: I agree with all that has been said here, however I tried using my Apple Buds with a Nokia Lumia phone, and there was an unbearable high pitched whistle that both parties could hear if you were on a call.... Therefore you can't guarantee that they will always work on all phones.\n", "Q: How would applications on the iPhone adapt to a bigger iPhone screen? A lot of rumours are going around about Apple and the iPhone 6, one if which is that the iPhone 6 could have a bigger (6 inch) screen.\nBeing an iOS developer I know that most apps on the iStore use images and sometimes custom controls which are perfectly optimised to display correctly on current screen sizes of the iPhone.\nIf Apple decides launch an iPhone with a bigger screen size surely application images would start to pixelate, and controls would stretch out of proportion.\nMy question is, how does Apple handle bigger screen sizes to keep apps from pixelating and stretching out of proportion and displaying incorrectly on devices? \nThanks\n\nA: If Apple were to increase the screen size, it would likely be done in the same fashion by which they have done it each previous time - in such a way that apps, while maybe not looking as great as they could, are functional and visibly proportional.\nWhen they introduced the Retina screen on iPhone 4, they kept the screen size the same but doubled the resolution. So while pre-Retina apps might have looked a bit blurry, they were still functional and had the exact same proportions.\nThis same process occurred when the Retina screen was applied to the iPad 3.\nWhen the 4\" screen was introduced on iPhone 5, they kept the same width but increased the height of the screen. Functionally this meant that all apps operated identically, with the sole difference being black letterboxing at the top and bottom of the screen. But since the pixel density did not change, nor the width, apps looked exactly the same with no proportion issues or visual degradation.\nApple has shown themselves to be very thoughtful about making such changes and there is no reason to believe they wouldn't be going forward.\n\nA: Apple would do what Apple wants to do. It's not like they are asking us for a choice. \nThere is one example on screen increase : 3.5\" to 4\" with the iPhone 5. \nIn this particular case there was no strech. On non iPhone 5 optimized app, there are 2 black space below and above the app. \n", "Q: How can I find out what software I've bought in the App Store? I'm Using my iPhone 3G and haven't backup it as frequently as I should and would like to know what software I've bought for it. So I know I don't have to pay for it again. Yes I can try and buy the software but I want to know of all the apps I've bought. \nI know some apps wont be available for my old iPhone but they will work if I buy a new one. I need to know how much money I will lose in Apps I can't use anymore. If I buy a new phone that isn't an iPhone. \nSo How can I find out what Apps I've bought for my iPhone. \nI have both Windows and Mac computers available. \nThe mac computer runs Mac os X 10.6.8, the iPhone 3G runs iOS 4.1.2\n\nA: On iPhone\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store on your device.\n\n*Make sure you are signed in  the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.  \n\n*Tap Updates from the bottom navigation bar.  \n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap on Purchased on navigation bar\n\n\n\n\n\n*Tap Purchased on the resulting screen.\n\n*Locate the app in your Purchased tab. Tap the download button.\n\n\n\nOn iTunes 11\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes on your computer. \n\n*Make sure that you have Show iTunes in the Cloud\nPurchases enabled in your iTunes preferences by going to iTunes >\nPreferences under the Store tab. Then, click OK. \n\n*If you're already signed in, choose Store > Sign In, and enter your Apple ID\nand password. \n\n*After you've signed in, click the Library located in the upper-right of the iTunes Store. Navigate to your iTunes library for the respective content type you wish to using the content selector in the upper-left. Choose Apps to download apps. Locate the item or title you wish to download. Click the download icon to download that item. For instance, you will want yours to say Apps.\n\n\n\nNote: The download icon for previously purchased movies is located to the right of the movie title. To download previously purchased apps and books, you'll need to navigate to the Purchased page under the Quick Links section in the iTunes Store.\n", "Q: Run Automator App conditionally at system startup i have build an Automator app working every time at system startup. \nBut sometime i wish to do not run it. There is a way to avoid (like holding a key at boot for example) Automator App runs when it do not need? \n\nA: Here is an alternate method:\nYou can include the Automator app on Startup (System Preferences => Users and Groups => Login Items => Click + and browse to Automator.app in Finder.\nYou can see an example here.\n\nThis will have it working every time on startup.\nTurning it off (temporarily)\nIf you hold the Shift key down just as your computer starts to log you into OS X (not when you hear the chime), it will ignore all of your login items.

I will keep it as simple as I can.\nLast week my Macbook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) started to act strange.\nIt started when I tried to open Skype and received an error complaining that the program could not start because Skype could not read (or lock, unfortunately I can't remember) it's skype.plist file.\nI restarted my Macbook hoping that would fix the problem (and I hadn't restarted in a while so I figured it was overdue).\nMy Macbook restarted and played the startup chime but then hung at the grey startup screen  with the spinning wheel. I thought nothing of it and did a hard shutdown but no matter how many times I did, the Macbook never advanced past the grey startup screen.\nI tried to boot using Safe and Verbose mode and got the following error in both cases:\nBootCacheControl : Unable to open /var/db/BootCache.playlist: 22 invalid argument\n\nI googled the error and tried various solutions with no luck.\nThe Macbook would boot to the built-in Mountain Lion recovery partition.\nAt this point I decided to backup my data so I could mess with the hard drive a bit more without fear of losing any data. I booted in to the recovery partition and cloned my hard drive onto another using a USB enclosure. It seemed to work OK and I verified all of my files were on the backup hard drive by plugging it into another Macbook.\nAfter cloning my hard drive I verified and repaired the disk and disk permissions using the disk utility in the recovery partition but that had no effect.\nAt this point I decided to reinstall Mountain Lion. I tried numerous times to reinstall it with the hard drive inside the Macbook (both using the recovery partition and a bootable Mountain Lion SD card) but couldn't get it to install. Eventually I got it to install, but only when the hard drive was placed in a USB enclosure. I knew this probably indicated a bigger underlying problem but decided to go ahead anyway.\nI installed Mountain Lion successfully but now it will not boot with the hard drive connected inside the Macbook, only when it is used in my USB enclosure. When the hard drive is placed in my USB enclosure it boots to Mountain Lion without any problem.\nWith the hard drive inside the Macbook:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the Macbook is booted as standard, it hangs on the grey startup screen with spinning wheel\n\n*If it is booted in verbose mode, it seems to boot successfully (shows no errors when the white text show up) and then hangs on a black screen with a solid white cursor in the top left corner (I can type at this point but it does nothing, it doesn't appear to be a terminal window)\n\n*If it is booted in safe mode, the progress bar appears, progresses to the end and then hangs on the grey startup screen with spinning wheel\n\n\nI noticed a lot of suggestions on the internet to replace the hard drive cable to the motherboard. I did and it had no effect.\nI've tried using another hard drive running a brand new install of Mountain Lion and that behaves exactly the same (boots fine using a USB enclosure but doesn't boot when connected internally).\nI've booked an appointment at the Apple store but figured it was worth posting the question anyway, in case anybody has a similar issue in the future (hopefully I'll be able to post the answer, if nobody else does, after a visit to the Genius bar).\nAny suggestions?\nThanks for reading.\n\nA: *\n\n*You have eliminated the possibility of a hardware issue on the hard drive by installing a new hard drive and also by installing the operating system on the previous hard drive via USB.\n\n*You have replaced the cable connecting the internal hard drive to the mother board, so it's not a cable problem.\n\n*The only thing left seems to be the hard drive controller on the motherboard. I expect the Genius bar will recommend replacing the motherboard.\nFor an older model Mac like yours, it might be worth searching for a replacement motherboard and having a local Mac repair shop swapping it in for you. It might cost less.\n\nA: I took my Macbook to the Apple store. After performing some tests the man at the genius bar agreed with me that it would either be the cable or the motherboard. He said he would replace the cable again (just to make sure the one I installed wasn't defective or installed incorrectly) and if that didn't work, replace the motherboard.\nI just received a call saying the Macbook was working after installing a new cable. I guess the cable I installed was defective or installed incorrectly.\nI hope no-one ever has a similar problem, but if they do, this is what fixed it for me.\n\nA: I literally unscrewed the cable, rubbed off some dirt and grit and dust, replaced it and SOLVED my issue! Thank you to this vlogger for his video! :) try it before you reinstall, format, or buy a new cable! Vid below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amg5w0rlwDo\n\nA: This YouTube video was incredibly helpful, and worked for me:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amg5w0rlwDo\nI'd only add that as I chose to upgrade my HDD to SSD at the same time as fixing this problem using James' technique, I had to re-set the PRAM by starting-up while holding the CMD-OPT-P-R keys down.  Before I did that, the MacBook would boot from the drive connected to USB, but not while installed directly onto the HDD SATA cable.  Once the PRAM was re-set, all works properly (and I'm not even sure I need a new cable).\n", "Q: Any way to enable File Vault for just one user? At the office, I use a machine which is used by several people.\nIs there any way to enable File Vault ONLY for MY user folder?\n(I.e., /Users/me)\n\nA: FileVault 1 used to do just this but the current FileVault 2 is whole disk encryption. It is technically possible to use the Logical Volume Manager underpinning FV2 to accomplish this, but it's rather complicated and not supported by Apple or any GUI System Preferences. \nYou could consider using an encrypted disk image created with DiskUtility. This would give you an optionally mountable disk that is encrypted. It appears on the HDD as a large file (like most installer .dmg files) and mounts with a double-click and password. This is similar to what FV1 used to do with a user's home directory.\n\nA: Filevault 2 is full hard drive encryption. It is not possible to set that to a folder or single user.\nHowever you can reenable the legacy file vault. This does what you are asking for. This does require some tinkering on the command line and is not for the faint of heart.\nYou can find instructions on http://www.taborcg.com/2011/10/16/how-to-enable-legacy-filevault-on-mac-osx-10-7-lion/.\n", "Q: Is there any way to disable OR password protect my iPhone to prevent someone from turning it off? If my phone is stolen, I would think the first thing a thief would do is turn it off.  Is there any way to disable or password protect this via settings (which I doubt) OR a cydia tweak?\n\nA: If you've jailbroken your phone, try either iGotYa or iCaughtYou Pro. They offer the best protection against theft without using a commercial MDM system, in my opinion.\nPowerGuard will provide the power feature you want, but it won't protect the phone from being placed in DFU mode. Still, a combination of both PowerGuard and one of the above apps is better than nothing.\n\n\n\n\nThis won't prevent powering it off, but, if you've upgraded to iOS7:\n\nWith Find My iPhone turned on in iOS 7, your Apple ID and password will be always be required before anyone can:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Turn off Find My iPhone on your device.\n  \n*Erase your device.\n  \n*Reactivate and use your device.\nThere is nothing you need to do except to keep Find My iPhone turned on and remember\n  your Apple ID and password.\n\nFrom a device security perspective, I think this would accomplish the same thing by rendering your device useless to anyone who steals or finds it.\n", "Q: How to get rid of erroneously drag-n-dropped folder shortcut in Finder toolbar? I erroneously drag-n-dropped a folder shortcut in my Finder toolbar.  I tried dragging it off and right clicking, to no avail.  How do I remove it?\n\nA: Hold CMD (⌘) key down and drag the icon out of the finder window.\nIt should blow itself away in clouds.\n", "Q: What happens to iPhoto originals in Aperture? iPhoto and Aperture can use the same library. When you edit a photo in iPhoto, it duplicates the photo and keeps the original. Aperture on the other hand saves only the edits and not a new file. What happens to these 'originals' when I open a library that was only used with iPhoto in Aperture? Can I remove the iPhoto 'originals' or are they kept even though Aperture handles things differently? \n\nA: See this link for how Aperture handles master images.\n\nMasters for images that you import as referenced images may reside in many different locations on your hard disk storage devices instead of in the single location of your main Aperture Library file.\n\n", "Q: Keychain Access is empty When I open my keychain access, it is empty. I can't see anything in it. However, I know that all of my stuff is still working (websites don't prompt me to log in, I join wifi networks, Xcode still see my developer certs), etc.\nI suspect that this happened when I changed my account password.

I realise there is the touch-t command but that does not work in Lion.

These timestamps are not always updated independently from each other, but one can have some individual control with a bit of care and with use of touch, SetFile, and chown (or chmod). To see this, let's experiment and create a new file from the command prompt #:\n# touch a.txt\n# stat a.txt\n16777218 5969798 -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 0 0 \"May 19 00:11:14 2015\" \"May 19 00:11:14 2015\" \"May 19 00:11:14 2015\" \"May 19 00:11:14 2015\" 4096 0 0 a.txt\n\nThe first date listed is last access time (atime), the second is last modification time (mtime), the third is last status change (ctime), the fourth is time of file creation (birth, Btime), see man lstat.\nTo modify access time (atime) to a specified time use:\n# touch -a -t201412312359.59 a.txt\n# stat a.txt\n16777218 5969798 -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 0 0 \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2014\" \"May 19 00:11:14 2015\" \"May 19 00:11:46 2015\" \"May 19 00:11:14 2015\" 4096 0 0 a.txt\n\nTo modify modification time (mtime) and time of file creation (Btime) to a specified time use:\n# touch -m -t201312312359.59 a.txt\n# stat a.txt\n16777218 5969798 -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 0 0 \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2014\" \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2013\" \"May 19 00:12:19 2015\" \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2013\" 4096 0 0 a.txt\n\nApparently this also automatically updates the time of last status change (ctime) to the current system time!\nTo modify only the time of creation/birth (Btime) to a given time, use (as proposed by others above):\n# SetFile -d \"12/31/1999 23:59:59\" a.txt\n# stat a.txt\n16777218 5969798 -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 0 0 \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2014\" \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2013\" \"May 19 00:12:19 2015\" \"Dec 31 23:59:59 1999\" 4096 0 0 a.txt\n\nTo modify only the time of last status change (ctime) to the current system time use for example:\n# chown username a.txt\n# stat a.txt\n16777218 5969798 -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 0 0 \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2014\" \"Dec 31 23:59:59 2013\" \"May 19 00:13:45 2015\" \"Dec 31 23:59:59 1999\" 4096 0 0 a.txt\n\nwhere username is the owner of the file (as reported by stat or ls -l). This doesn't change the ownership of the file, but accesses the file's inode and records this as a time of last status change. Unfortunately, it is not possible to specify the time explicitly here other than by changing the computer's time...\nIn summary, to be able to change the four timestamps independently, one may use (in this order for the last 3):\n\n\n*\n\n*touch -a -tCCYYMMDDHH.SS <file>\n\n*touch -m -tCCYYMMDDHH.SS <file>\n\n*SetFile -d \"MM/DD/CCYY HH:MM:SS\" <file>\n\n*[set system date] chown username <file> [revert to normal system date]\n\n\n(Of course, resetting the system date may not be a risk-free operation, you've been warned.)\n\nA: The command-line touch command works in Lion, but you need a little background on how to use it.\nFirstly, you need to type it in, it's not a utility that operates graphically in a window.  The place you type it in is an app called Terminal.  You can find this in your Utilities folder, or use Spotlight search to find it.\nOnce you start it, you get a command line window where you can type in commands.  Just because you are typing doesn't mean it has anything to do with coding, but to someone new to \"old fashioned\" OS commands it can look a little intimidating.\nSo, the command is called touch, and after the command you can pass various parameters, the only required one being the filename.  Typing the following will set the last modified date of the file to the current time:\ntouch filename\n\nOf course, you may need to find the file first, which could require further commands to get to it.  the cd or Change Directory command helps here:\ncd ~/Desktop/files/PDFs\ntouch filename\n\nOr, you can simply add the full path to the file as part of the command:\ntouch ~/Desktop/files/PDFs/filename\n\nMore advanced usage of the touch command allows you to specify the time you want to set, rather than using the time at execution, set access instead of modification times etc.  This is what parameters like -t and others do.  Some set the time to be the time of another file, some set it to go back, or forward in time by X amount, (see here for more details), eg:\ntouch -d '1 May 2005 10:22' file8\n\n\nThe following is from this page which is also useful reference, and a great example with some tips for those who are uncomfortable with file locations on the command line\nNote that this will change both the date modified and date created attributes only if your file was created after the date you enter. This is because a file cannot be modified before it has been created. If created before the date you set, only the modified date will be changed.\n\nHow to change the date created attribute of a file?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open up the Terminal application (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app) or if you prefer use iTerm.\n  \n*Type this into Terminal (without hitting enter/return) inserting the date in the format of YYYYMMDDhhmm:\ntouch -t 201212211111\n\n  \n*Open a Finder window and locate the file you wish to modify and drag and drop it into the Terminal window, it will then insert the file location using command line terminology. Here’s an example of what should be typed into the Terminal at this point:\ntouch -t 201212211111 /Volumes/Mac\\ HD/Pictures/somefile.jpg\n\n201212211111 in the example above represent “December 21, 2012 11:11 AM\n\n\nA: touch -t normally only changes the modification and access times. It only changes the creation time if the target time is before the original creation time.\ntouch -t 199912312359 file.txt\ntouch -t $(date -jf %FT%T 1999-12-31T23:59:59 +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) file.txt\n\nSetFile -d always changes the creation time.\nSetFile -d '12/31/1999 23:59:59' file.txt\nSetFile -d \"$(GetFileInfo -m test.txt)\" file.txt\n\nSetFile is part of the command line tools package which can be downloaded from developer.apple.com/downloads or from Xcode's preferences.\n\nA: The easiest way I found was to create a new folder, copy all the sub-folders of the greyed out folder into the new folder, and voila, the new folder is not greyed out.  You can even do this in the finder.\n", "Q: trying to figure out how to use App Switcher on Lion I recently bought a used Mighty Mouse, the slightly older kind with a little button on top that scrolls. (could anyone tell me what to call this button?) \nI set the button to use the App Switcher, which I had never used before. \nApp Switcher opens okay, no problem there. and I can go left and right between them. but I can't actually open or switch to the app or, for that matter, close them. I can use App Switcher using the keyboard, though, thanks to tutorials. but I can't figure out how to do it with the mouse. \nso how I can actually use App Switcher using the mouse? FYI, I use 10.8.4.\n\nA: Use the Mouse System Preference. There is a setting for each button on the mouse - including the nipple like one on the top. On my iMac I have this set to Off, but there is an option for Application Switcher, which if you chose that it would allow you to switch application by clicking the nipple button. I just tried this and it works, though I might not leave things set this way. If you don't like the idea of a nipple button, it's also called a mini mouse button.

I have used  Mail and Messages with my various Google accounts since I purchased it, but never Calendar. When I checked the Calendar option all I got was the header for where the calendars should be.\nI cannot see any calendars on that account, create/view/edit events, or anything. My sync settings on the Google side are just fine as it works on other devices. Last night I took it a step further and created a new user account on my laptop and first thing I did was connect my Google account. Everything worked.\nI have tried deleting the Calendar cache files, preferences, accounts, and pretty much anything short of the app itself. I even went ahead and cleared out my Keychain of anything relating to that account or Google in general. As a last ditch effort, I did a full clean up and reset of the SyncServices system.\nShort of painstakingly comparing the two accounts I have no idea what could be causing this problem. There are no user specific applications or extensions running on my machine, and I've performed no \"under the hood\" tweaks to Mountain Lion.\nDoes anyone have any idea where I should be looking for a cause? I haven't found anything like this problem online yet, and I definitely don't want to migrate my stuff to a new account.\nKey points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Calendars do not sync at all to my primary user account.\n\n*I've tried multiple Google accounts.\n\n*Only a new user account in Mountain Lion is able to connect.\n\n*All SyncServices files and all Calendar files have been wiped and recreated to no effect.\n\n\nA: I actually fixed my problem by deleting and re-creating my user account. I chose to keep the home folder in place and used it as an existing folder when I created the replacement account.\nWhile I was troubleshooting everything I was monitoring the logs and saw no error specific error messages. The only thing that looked suspicious was a message about CalendarAgent returning status 4. I wasn't able to find a reference for that status message.\nIf I understand it correctly, the problem would had to have been in the /var/db/ directory in order to get fixed by an account deletion.\n", "Q: Can one pan across a panorama photo that is longer than the screen in Keynote?

I have installed the latest Dia and XQuartz (X11) on my Mac OS X 10.8.3 retina display. As seen in the screenshot below, why do the items and anything I draw look blurry and pixelly? What can I do about it? Thanks!\n\n\nA: The issue stems from the way X11 handles pixels. There are some third party workarounds, but it would seem that one needs to wait until XQuartz is updated to deal with Retina scaling.\nI have installed QuickResFree from the Mac App Store, which lets you have finer control over the resolution than the Mac display defaults. This makes it so I can use my X11 apps and decrease the apparent blurriness, but switch back to something more reasonable for Retina-compatible apps.\nI will note that this solution is not optimal, and the problem still lies in the fact that many apps are not yet programmed to be able to deal with the pixel scaling and Retina.\n\nA: It's probably because the app does not support the retina display.\nTwitter had this issue for a year, and it actually looked worse than simply \"non-retina\" graphics, as it was blurry and hard to read. The fix for that app was to right click on the application in finder and check \"Open in Low Resolution\".\n\nRather than trying to upscale, I believe that approach simply doubles the pixels (i.e. 1 pixel in the app is displayed as 4 retina pixels).\nFor Twitter (until they added retina support) at least, this fix made the app usable and not \"hurts your eyes\" blurry.  It may not help your exact situation but it provides an alternative for the retina upscaling.\n\nA: An alternative if it isn't working, is Lucidchart. It supports retina display, and is compatible with all operating systems since it's online. I can't tell you exactly why Dia isn't clear, but I can recommend this way around it. Lucidchart\n", "Q: How can you stop \"Verification required\" when installing free apps? Whenever I install a free app on my iPad, this message appears:\n\nVerification required\n  Before you can make purchases, you must tap continue to sign in, then verify your payment info.\n\nWhat does it mean? How can I stop it?\n\nA: Generally verification comes up for one of two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your previously-supplied payment information failed for your last purchase\n\n*You are using a device which has never purchased (or downloaded, for free apps) anything from the App Store with your account before.\n\n\nMost likely it is the second one.

Once completed you can complete the download of your free app.\n\nA: I found a very easy solution to the verification problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your account.\n\n*For the list of credit cards, select None.\n\n*Save and you can start downloading without being  charged.\n\n", "Q: How do I set Mail.app not to send the recipient names as they appear in my address book When I send mails to addresses from my address book, the recipients in the address bar are shown like name <nick@domain.tld>. Can I somehow prevent that name part, so that only the actual mail address is shown and not the names, as I name them in my personal address book? I kind of feel like it's not for the public how I name my contacts.\n\nA: While composing and email you can click the arrow in the address and choose Edit Address or double-click the address to edit the information. By deleting the name and leaving just the email address (it should look something like < someone@somewhere.com >) should do the trick. I couldn't find a way of having this changes done permanently, though.\n", "Q: What can I use a iMac G5 17\" 1.9GHz for?

I mean, these numbers mean to me nothing, I want to know what can I do with thin machine? Can it play ~10GB .mkv videos?\n\nA: It can do moderate Photoshop provided you use version CS2 or earlier. Or do a home server job.\nBut it's too slow for modern internet (I mean Youtube, Gmail, Facebook, any flash etc.) and it will not play any HD h.264 compressed video (even 720p) without lag.\nHave a look at Geekbench Mac benchmark to have a broader picture how this one compares to other Macs \n", "Q: Sharing mac WiFi over Ethernet breaks all internet connections I'm trying to share internet from my macbook to my iMac. The macbook connects via WiFi, and I want to share it's internet over ethernet to the iMac.\nWHen I set this up in sharing and turn on internet sharing, my macbook loses all internet connectivity. I can only get it back by turning off sharing and then disconnecting and reconnecting to my WiFi. My settings are below:\n\nThe iMac doesn't get any connectivity either. It recognises that there is an ethernet connection and it get's an IP, but it can't access the internet.\n\nA: The order of your internet connections is reversed. \nFor internet connection sharing to work it should be:\n\"Share your connection from Ethernet\" \n\"To computers using Wi-Fi\".\nHere are the instructions:\nhttp://mac.appstorm.net/how-to/internet-howto/sharing-your-internet-connection-via-wi-fi/\n", "Q: I'm wondering if my 13 inch MacBook Air is having battery issues? This is my current battery information. Could someone please let me know if I need a new battery or what might be wrong with it?\nBattery Information:\n\nModel Information:\n  Serial Number:           D86221701NNDKRNA5\n  Manufacturer:            SMP\n  Device Name:               bq20z451\n  Pack Lot Code:           0\n  PCB Lot Code:            0\n  Firmware Version:        406\n  Hardware Revision:       000a\n  Cell Revision:           162\n\nCharge Information:\n  Charge Remaining (mAh):  6098\n  Fully Charged:           Yes\n  Charging:                No\n  Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 6331\n\nHealth Information:\n  Cycle Count:               60\n  Condition:               Normal\n  Battery Installed:       Yes\n  Amperage (mA):           0\n  Voltage (mV):            8293\n\n\nA: I would recommend using coconutBattery to monitor your battery life and record degradation statistics. For example, my MacbookPro is 21 months old, 142 cycles and has 94% of original capacity (6519 out of 6900). But Pro batteries are different from Airs, they degrade slower.\nHere you can see how Air battery degrades over a year (recorded daily). Yours does not look different.\n\nA: The statistics you print look decent for a lightly used, fully charged Air battery. Most of them have voltages between 8.1 and 8.4 V when fully charged.\nI don't have recent full charge capacity numbers, but perhaps someone with an other similar Air will post their numbers. Since all batteries have slightly different charge and voltage behavior, you would need to monitor these numbers through several charge cycles (or see how your numbers are changing over time) to tell how the health of the battery is doing.\nIn reality, there probably are other things you can do to test your battery (like how long it takes to charge or how long it will run while awake and lightly loaded) and you will need to have a service technician run Apple's battery tests to tell if your snapshot numbers are within our out of spec.\n", "Q: Video from Mac to Apple TV, audio to Airport Express I want to output video from my rMBP to my Apple TV but send the audio to AirPort Express connected to my sound system.\nI have tried every way imaginable to accomplish this, and nothing seems to work. All links in the chain have updated software & firmware. Hardware is the following; rMBP Late 2012, Current Gen ATV, Current Gen APE. All running on rock solid WiFi.\nIf I start by sending video, it quits when I select the APE audio source, if I start by sending audio, it stops sending when I enable mirroring on the Mac.  \nI have tried under System Preferences on the Mac to have the system audio routed to the AirPort Express, but no luck. I have tried routing the audio to the APE from the ATV's prefs, also a no go.\nStrangely this works like a champ from an iOS device, not from my Mac. I can send the video from the Mac to the ATV and send the audio to APE via Airfoil, but there is a noticeable lip sync issue, so that is not an option.\nI read a Lex Friedman article on MacWorld touting the ability to do this.\n\nA: You'll love this: On Apple Tv go to Settings → Airplay and pick your Express under Speakers. Now stream away to your Apple Tv. Everything is in sync and all, at least using Beamer (which is much superior to screen mirroring if you are watching movies).\nEdit: sorry you already tried this? Works perfectly here.\n\nA: This article on Apple's support site seems to indicate that it has to be content \"on\" the Apple TV, for lack of a better term. I realize you can't store content on the Apple TV, but I mean that screen mirroring would be excluded. If you used something like Beamer to stream the movie to the Apple TV, or used iTunes Home Sharing, I presume it would work.\n", "Q: Top of screen application menu bar on every monitor in multiple display I have a two monitor setup but the top of the screen application menu bar appears only on one (main) monitor.  I would like it to appear on both so that I don't have to travel with my mouse from the other to the main monitor to use it.  Can this be done and how?\n\nA: For now, use SecondBar.

I extracted atMonitor using Archive Utility and The Unarchiver and in both cases it appears in the Finder as 3.1Mb and in bash only 102 bytes. Strange is that I can execute it and I can look in the package content both in Terminal and in Finder and the files inside appears not to be a symlinks. \nThe Problem is that I can't copy the .app file through shared folder from another computer. \nWhat is the problem with it?\nUpdate:\nin Finder:\n\nin Terminal:\n\n\nA: .app files are really just folders, but applications (like finder) see them differently and calculate the size of the contents of the folder.\nEmpty folders have the size of 68 bytes, non-empty folders are 102 bytes or bigger.\nAll my folders and .apps are 102 bytes since they contain only 1 sub-folder.\n", "Q: Does using \"rm\" command cause journaling corruption? Some time ago I had some problems with my Mac drive, so I went to the recovery partition and used Disk Utility to check for problems. It reported a huge discrepancy between the journaled free blocks and the actual free blocks, in the case of gigabytes.\nI was wondering what may have caused this problem, and I remembered deleting a huge hierarchy of folders using rm -rf, and since this command is almost instantaneous, I thought it may have caused this problem.\nDoes this make any sense? Should I avoid using this command on OS X with a Journaled drive?\n\nA: \nNOTE FOR CASUAL READERS: rm -rf destroys data.  Use with caution.\n\nrm -rf may appear to go fast, but it is actually recursively going depth-first into each directory and unlinking the files within—the same operation that is used for any file deletion on Unix systems.\nYou can see how rm -rf works by adding the -v flag, e.g. rm -rfv.\nThere's no reason to believe that rm itself is responsible for journaling failures.  It's a proven and safe command that does not have any low-level access to the disk.\nIt is possible that the access pattern created triggered some bug in HFS+, but that seems unlikely as well; I rm -rf sizable trees of files on my machine frequently and haven't seen a problem.\n", "Q: What do the appleprofilepolicyd and wdhelper processes do? I found in activity monitor appleprofilepolicyd and wdhelper but after googling a while didn't found any interesting information:\n\n\n*\n\n*wdhelper - could be a webdrive or webdav - found only wdhelper.dll but nothing really related to the process\n\n*appleprofilepolicyd - something related to “Apple Profile Policy” (\"captain obvious to the rescue!\") - but still no related search results for it\n\n\nWhat are theese processes do and what are they required for (dependencies)?\n\nA: From the Apple Developer man pages:\n\nappleprofilepolicyd is a system daemon that implements a policy for the services provided by AppleProfileFamily.  When an AppleProfileFamily user asks to perform an action, this daemon is invoked to make the final policy decision.\n\nEssentially, this governs what apps, accounts, processes, etc. have access to what services and activities.\nI believe wdhelper is a LaunchDaemon that is implemented by, for example, a WD MyBook drive when it is installed to the Mac. \n\nA: wdhelper XPC helper tool for performing privileged operations for WirelessDiagnosticsSupport.framework\n\nA: wdhelper is a daemon launched from:\n    /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.wdhelper.plist\nwhich is located there:\n    /usr/libexec/wdhelper\nwhich is regularly running on your system as soon as you are using\na wireless (AirPort, Wi-Fi or WLAN) interface.\nFrom my personnal analysis,\nthis daemon is in charge to guess which is the\nnature of the wireless environnment:\n\n\n*\n\n*channels\n\n*signal quality\n\n*access control (802.1X, captive portal…)\n\n*well known hot spots\n\n*well known constructors misbehaviours\n\n\nit does launch nc (netcat), netstat, kextstat, ifconfig, ipconfig, scutil, airport and airportd\nit does also inspect the MacOS X system behaviour, most presumably because this daemon could become too intrusive, through the use of\nspindump, system_profiler, top, ioreg and killall (in case processes fail that bad).\n", "Q: Using Time Capsule to Access Internet I have a 2008 Mac Pro and it has no wifi card in it. I have a time capsule. Can I connect the time capsule to my router via wifi and use an Ethernet cable from the time capsule to my Mac Pro to access the Internet?\n\nA: This depends on the type of WIFI network that is being produced by your WIFI router, as to whether the TC can extend it or not.  Basically, the best way to find out is to experiment on your TC - fire up your Airport Utility, and in the Wireless configuration option, look to see if it will let you extend rather than create a wireless network, and then see if will find your existing network.\nEDIT: I should add that the brand of wireless router is a primary consideration as well. Many brands don't play well with TC, AE, or any other Apple networking gear.\n\nA: I tried to clarify your topology in comments above. I presume you want a wireless bridge between your router and the TC. The answer to that question, as stuffe suggests above, is to try it. However, I would suggest using the wireless router to control your traffic, and putting the TC in bridge mode. If possible, I would connect the TC to the router via Ethernet cable, even if the wireless bridge is possible.\n", "Q: Remove menu bar items via command line I know that menu extras can be removed by command-dragging, but is there any way to use a defaults write or other command-line method?\n\nA: Found a possible answer over on superuser.com:\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Removes the Wifi menu from the menubar.\n# This setting is set on a per-user basis, so needs to be run as the user\n# Will require a logout.

I have an iMac running 10.5.8. How well/badly do you think it would work if I upgrade to the most recent version of MacOsX (and can I leap there in one go, or do I need to first upgrade to an intermediate version of the operating system)?\nHere is what System Profiler tells me:\n   - Model Name: iMac\n   - Model Identifier: iMac5,2\n   - Processor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo\n   - Processor Speed: 1.83 GHz\n   - Number Of Processors: 1\n   - Total Number Of Cores: 2\n   - L2 Cache: 2 MB\n   - Memory: 2 GB\n   - Bus Speed: 667 MHz\n   - Boot ROM Version: IM52.0090.B09\n   - SMC Version (system): 1.6f0\n   - Serial Number (system): W86450CMWV7\n   - Hardware UUID: 00000000-0000-1000-8000-0016CBA120C3\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nA: From Apple's site:\n\nIf you’re running OS X Leopard and would like to upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion, first you’ll need to upgrade to OS X Snow Leopard. You can purchase OS X Snow Leopard here.\n\n\nA: Gonna be tight, if I was to upgrade to 10.8 on that, I would be looking to max the RAM out to whatever is supported (it's old RAM, shouldn't be at a premium for DDR2 yet), and I would also look to inserting an SSD as the boot disk.\nOther than that, the CPU is just fine, it will never fly, but it's faster than my 1.6Ghz Core 2 Duo running in my MBA with 4Gb and an SSD.\n", "Q: Clicking on dock icon makes windows for other applications disappear I just began using a new Macbook Pro 15\" Retina running Mountain Lion. After a couple of days transfering files (from my previous Macbook Pro (early 2011) running Snow Leopard) and generally setting it up the way I wanted, I started getting the following behavior: When I have a few applications open, if I switch to another application by clicking on that application's dock icon, all other application windows disappear. \nAfter some searching, I found this discussion of a similar problem. The solution there was to select the \"Show All\" option in the application menu (the menu in the upper left corner just to the right of the Apple menu) for a given application. I tried that and all my application windows did indeed appear. But then the next time I clicked on a dock icon, all the other windows disappeared again and I'd have to click \"Show All\" again. I'm trying to figure out how to get back to \"Show All\" being the permanent default.\nOne other thing: Upon further checking, I discovered that when an application creates a second icon in the dock (for example, I currently have two Firefox and two R windows open, which has resulted in there being a second Firefox and a second R icon on the right side of my dock) only clicking on the \"new\" icons causes other windows to disappear. Clicking on the \"original\" icons just switches applications without making any other application windows disappear. \nI never experienced this behavior before with my previous Macbook Pro. I'm trying to figure out why this is happening (did I accidentally change some setting?) and how to make sure it never happens again. If it would help to know more about the hardware/software configuration or settings of my Mac, please let me know what information to post.\n\nA: It appears that Single Application Mode has been activated. Open /Applications/Terminal and copy the following command:\n   defaults write com.apple.dock single-app -bool false killall Dock\n\nTo reverse this, replace false with true.\nAlternate GUI Way\nYou can also Option + Click the app icon in the dock to reverse the behavior.\n\nA: I found one more possibility for those who are squeamish about the command line: Download the free Tinker Tool. \nOpen the program and go to the \"Dock\" tab. Look for the setting called \"Single Application Mode\". If it's checked, uncheck it and then click \"Relaunch Dock\" (button in lower right corner). If it's not checked, check it, relaunch the Dock, uncheck it, and then relaunch the Dock again.\nTinker Tool has lots of other customization settings that you might useful as well.\n", "Q: Shader tester iOS App? Will Apple reject an app which renders a 3D scene that allows you to modify and compile GLSL ES shaders by editing them in the app? (something not unlike e.g. http://shadertoy.com, but native OpenGL ES 2)\nWhat about if it registers for a file type and opens .vsh and .fsh files as documents?\nI know that it may be problematic if the app automatically downloads shader code from a server (and then runs it), but the answer is not so clear for these other approaches.\n\nA: Shaderific allows you to \"import shader files with Dropbox or iTunes Document Sharing\" so they were allowed, but the bad news is that you have at least one strong competitor.\n\nA: Unless a similar app is already published on the App Store, it is fairly impossible to determine where Apple's line will be without talking to Apple. Even if there are similar apps already published, it does not mean Apple will not reverse itself and start removing apps of a certain type or rejecting update submissions.\n", "Q: Can anyone manipulate the iPad keyboard I am looking for some info surrounding the iPad keyboard. WITHOUT jailbreaking the device, I was curious if someone has been been able to manipulate the look of the keyboard. The functionality should remain the same, but the actual look should change. I was curious if anyone could change the color or shape of the keys. \n\nA: Not without jailbreaking. With a jailbreak, there are several options for doing this though.\nThe one that comes to mind immediately is Winterboard, which isn't relegated just to keyboards, but theming the entire OS.\nThere is also Color Keyboard, which changes the look and feel of the iOS keyboard (although it is iPhone only).\n", "Q: How to propose rescheduling a meeting sent by someone else in Outlook for Mac 2011? This should be easy - but there doesn't seem to be any equivalent of 'Decline and propose a new time' or even just 'Send update' for meetings in the Mac version of Outlook. \nThe folks at Quora think this feature simply doesn't exist and that it's impossible. Every help page I can find that looks relevant refers only to Windows versions of Outlook. http://office.microsoft.com/ has help pages titled \"Change an appointment, event, or meeting\", but only for the Windows versions - for Mac, the only remotely related help page I can find is for how to \"Create a meeting or appointment\".\nEdit - just found an Outlook for Mac 2011 page for updating meetings, but it refers to a \"Send update\" button in the \"Meeting\" tab that just doesn't exist for me. Here's all I have after editing a meeting:\n\nSurely this can't be impossible? It seems too basic and fundamental to be a missing feature, but the only option I can find is to decline the meeting then create a whole new meeting.\n\nThere's a post on MS Answers that suggests that updates are always sent automatically with any change, but this seems to simply be wrong. I've never had updates send when I change a meeting, and whenever I do save changes to a meeting, it warns me that You have made changes to this meeting. If the organizer sends an update, your changes will be deleted.\n\nDetails if more are needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Outlook 2011, Lion OS\n\n*Office network with a MS Exchange network\n\n*I'm not using MS Outlook for Mac out of choice... It's a company policy I can't influence. So \"outlook sux use sumthin else\" won't help here.\n\n*Exact task is: there's a meeting that has been accepted, where the invite was sent by someone else. I'm trying to change the meeting time in a way that sends an update to everyone else in the meeting. I can open the meeting and change the time, but that only changes the copy stored in my personal calendar - it doesn't update the other people about the new time.\n\n*There are no permissions issues. My user account has permission to edit this meeting.\n\n\nA: So, it looks like Outlook for Mac 2011 is incapable of proposing updates for meetings sent by other people (or, for meetings sent by Outlook for Windows users), regardless of standard permissions. \nLooks like this is another missing feature alongside voting buttons and easy calendar sharing requests. In Outlook for Windows you can propose updates that the organiser can accept or reject; in Outlook for Mac there seems to be nothing like this.\n\nThis is based on the fact there are 'Send update' options seemingly only for meetings that you are the organiser of:\n\nIt looks like the only possibility is to decline the meeting, then send your own - or, if that's not an option (which will be true any time it's not appropriate to just become the new meeting organiser), you need to email the organiser (e.g. in a 'Decline' comment) and ask them to do it for you. \nA bit rubbish because, if they're a Windows user, they'll think you're a fool who can't find the 'Propose new time' button, and they'll think you're wasting their time asking them to do simple tasks for you...\n\nA: I've not found a good solution for it. When I need to propose a new time, I fire up a virtual machine and run the Windows version of Outlook to handle it. That's a pretty sad workaround, but it works. \n", "Q: Cisco VPN timeout issues I'm trying to use the native Cisco VPN client installed with Lion and it's been a terrible experience. The VPN times out between 15 and 45 minutes and I can't seem to fix it. I've followed guides for fixing this problem and it's gotten me nowhere. I copied the .conf files for each VPN that I have and disabled dead peer detection, changed proposal check to claim, and increased the lifetime time to 5 hours. I also changed my racoon.conf file to look in the directory where my custom .conf files are. I could stay connected all day when I used Ubuntu and I'd really like to have that ability back.\nIs there a 3rd party client that I could use other than the Cisco one? I don't want to boot into 32-bit mode. Is there another fix that I missed?\n\nA: There is Cisco AnyConnect, which replaces the native VPN client. There is also a standalone Cisco VPN client for Mac.\nLink\n", "Q: Time Machine backup between networks I have a computer on network A that I would like to backup via Time Machine to a drive connected to a computer on network B. Can this be done? Would I need a VPN? I just need the network B computer's drive to show up as Shared to the computer on network A.\n\nA: *\n\n*No, this cannot be done as far as I am aware. It may be possible to hack together some way to fool it into working, but I would be willing to bet that it would eventually (and by 'eventually' I mean 'fairly soon' not 'some day before the sun goes out') fail.\n\n*Unless you have some specific reason to have to use Time Machine, I would recommend using CrashPlan instead of Time Machine. While there is a 'for pay' option with CrashPlan, you can use it completely free to back up to another computer anywhere. It doesn't matter if it's on the same network or across the Internet. You can set a very high encryption rate and customize the amount of CPU that the program uses. You also get much more control over the frequency of backups and how long information is retained. All in all it is a much better option than Time Machine or Time Capsule, in my opinion.\n(I have no connection to the company except as a paying customer who is very satisfied with their service. I backup all of my laptops across the LAN to one 'retired' MacBook which has a very large external drive attached.)\n", "Q: How can I get music in other languages from the iTunes Store on my iPhone? So, I have English iTunes and I wanted to get a Spanish song. Is there a way I could change the iTunes store I am using to get it and then change it back or something?\n\nA: There is an option in iTunes to choose Latino music.\nSee the picture below (I'm on iTunes 11). \n\n\nA: Outside of what is available in the US iTunes store as noted in the other answer, it is not possible to switch stores unless you have a valid method of payment (credit card or gift card from that country) and billing address for that country. Even then, iTunes may try to make it difficult for you to do so because it will read your IP address and use that to try to determine where you are in the world. Once it realizes you are in the US, it may try to redirect you automatically to the US store.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Apple Push Notification Service only for local network? I have an apsd process which stands for Apple Push Notification service daemon man_page_on_developers.apple.com (it has a name applepushserviced on osx 10.7 and lower). Is it possible to restrict it only for local APN server without having a connection to the apple global APN server?\n\nA: Disabling the internet connection for this service would prevent you from receiving any notifications which use the Apple Push service. Restricting it to your local network would have the same effect as preventing it from connecting at all, since there is no local APN server.\n", "Q: Requirements to use 'open -b \"bundle.id\" ' for OS X I have a post install script which opens and runs my application silently. The app was made using Automator and basically runs an Applescript which in turn runs a Bash script embedded from the app Resources folder.\nThe postinstall script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nopen -b \"com.company.ApplicationName\"\n\nworks on some machines and not others.

I'm assuming I'm missing some kind of prerequisite software on the machines failing.\nAnyone aware of the requirements to use open -b \"bundleid\"? Xcode, Xcode with Command Line Tools or something? I'd appreciate any insight.\n\nA: My guess is that it is working on systems where the app has been present long enough for the app to be registered with the system, but fails on systems where it has not been present very long.\nThere is a possible solution here:\nThe command (all one line)\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\nThe Caveat\nAfter running this command, OS X may prompt you before letting you open some applications for the first time. I would NOT suggest running that on someone else's Mac or they are likely to get irritated with you.\nInstead, I would suggest using open -a /path/to/your/app instead of open -b {bundle-id}\n\nA: To unregister a specific application (the one that makes troubles, say /Applications/AppName.app) from the LaunchServices database, run:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/AppName.app/\n\nThen re-launch the app in Finder to register it again.\n", "Q: Want to Update iMovie, etc. on MacBook Pro I have updates of iMovie, etc. on my MacBook Pro. But every time I go to update it tells me to sign into one of my email addresses first. I press OK and nothing happens. I sign into the email and there is no mail in there. Where do I sign in? I'm not sure what to do.\n\nA: One possible explanation is that you have the latest version already. The latest iMovie version is 9.0.9 (1795). It prompts you to sign in to check if there are any newer versions. Since it finds nothing, it updates nothing.\n\nA: Depending upon your OS, and how you obtained iMovie (for example, since you cited it in your post), you will either receive updates through the Software Update selection from the main Apple menu, or you will get them through the App Store. The latter method requires you to log in with your Apple ID. Presuming that you have a valid Apple ID, you shouldn't be required to interact with your email at all.\n", "Q: Create subdirectory in Finder tree view Currently, I am only able to create a subdirectory in Finder by double-clicking the parent dir so that it becomes the top level selected in the main panel and creating it there by right-clicking and then selecting New Folder.

Hitting space right before the home button will trigger the three dots in the other end. I see this happen a lot to friends that either doesn't understand that the touch screen recognizes every tough as input or they just don't care.\nIf they don't empty the message box it will continue to show the dots for some time. And if they're in an area with bad coverage Apple's iMessage server might have received the started typing command, but never got the clear command, or if you're in a bad area your phone might have received the started typing command, but not the clear. Usually happens to me when travelling on country roads.\n\nA: The 3 dots indicator appears when a user is typing and they have enabled the \"Show typing\" setting. However, they may start typing and then decide not to send the message, or stop to do something else, and therefore the message is never sent. The 3 dots indicator is not an indication that a message is incoming, simply that the user is typing.\nThe indicator only appears when they are typing a message specifically to you. It does not trigger when they are typing messages to others.\nHowever, the indicator can get stuck if there are network errors or slowness, if the server is overloaded or has stale data. In practice, it can remain stuck until you get another complete message from that sender or you decide to delete that conversation.\n\nA: Or, this:\n\nRead instructions here.\n\nA: It simply means they decided against sending a message after starting to type one.\nYou can find a detailed breakdown of when that indicator appears in the April 2015 Slate video, \"When Can Someone See You Typing? Explained.\" On iOS, the indicator appears as soon as the user on the sending end starts typing. It only goes away when either that user sends a message, or 60 seconds elapses.

Now I can connect to Internet using my browser and applications.\nBut I cannot connect to internet from my terminal.\nI tried\nexport http_proxy=\"http://username:password@proxyserver:port/\" \n\nBut still terminal applications cannot connect to the internet.\n\nA: Terminal does not use proxy settings configured in the network preferences pane because it doesn't do any connection. Terminal just let you fire commands which will use the network in different ways.\nWhen setting your http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables should not include the http: or https: prefixes.\nTherefore the environment variable in your case should read:\nhttp_proxy=username:password@proxyserver:port\n\nNote: many old programs have issues with connecting through proxy servers which require authentication before connecting.\nAdditional Tip:\nDue to our infrastructure we found it much easier to have users run SquidMan locally and have it configured to connect to our main proxy. This allows the local machine to act as a proxy directly, and eliminates a lot of authentication issues etc when using proxy servers on Mac machines, especially in a mixed and AD environments.\nIn the case of using this method our http_proxy and https_proxy would be:\nhttp_proxy=localhost:3128\n\n\nA: I recently ran into this issue and in searching found this post.

The administrator can use the Boot Camp application to restart the Mac into Windows. The guest account however should also be able to use Boot Camp and restart into Windows. Is this in any way possible, because it seems you always need to enter the Administrator password in order to reboot into Windows?\n\nA: You can use the following code to create an Applescript application to accomplish this.\n\ndo shell script \"bless -mount \\\"/Volumes/Boot Camp Name\\\"\n  -setBoot -nextonly\" user name \"admin username\" password \"admin password\" with administrator privileges\ndo shell script \"shutdown -r now\" user name \"admin username\" password\n  \"admin password\" with administrator privileges\n\nYou will need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Paste the above code into AppleScript Editor\n\n*Fill in your admin username, password and name of your bootcamp volume where necessary\n\n\nOnce your details are entered you can save the script for editing later and then export it (File > Export) as an Application, making sure to check the \"Run-Only\" box before clicking Save.  What this does is create an AppleScript application that can only be run, not edited or viewed.  When you launch the application your Mac will temporarily reboot into whichever volume you specified in the code.\nThe following accomplishes this:\n\n\n*\n\n*bless & setboot - This designates the default startup disk\n\n*nextonly - This tells the system that the volume designated in this command should only be the startup disk for the following boot, subsequent restarts will boot to the proper startup disk.\n\n*shutdown -r now - This tells the system to reboot now \n\n*Exporting as a run-only AppleScript application allows the students to execute the command but not view the contents, which should keep the admin credentials safe.  I made a sample application on my system and was unable to view the script inside the application by digging through the package contents.  It may be possible to get around this but I couldn't find a direct way.\nTo make this accessible to Guest users in addition to standard user accounts you could add it into the default user template at /System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj/.  Settings, files, etc in this location carry over to the \"on the fly\" Guest accounts available in the newer Mac OS X revisions.\nHopefully that does the trick for you!\n\nA: You can boot into Windows without needing to change the Startup Disk.\nSimply hold ⌥ alt/option whilst the system is booting to have the option to select a boot drive. From there, you can select the Boot Camp partition. Next time the machine reboots, it will reboot into OS X unless you repeat the procedure.\n\nA: BootChamp\nBootChamp is a menu bar app that allows you to reboot into Windows on the next boot.\n\nAdmin is only required the first time this is carried out…\n\nThe first time a restart is initiated with BootChamp, it will ask for the admin password. After this initial process, you will no longer need to enter your admin password again.\n\nThe next time the machine boots, it will boot back into OS X.\n\nBootChamp does not modify your startup disk, it only temporarily sets the startup disk for the next restart.\n\nYou can add this to the Guest account by adding it to the Guest user template at /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/. The simplest way may be to log in as a Guest, then install BootChamp as a login item, give it your administrator password, and copy the contents of the Guest account to that folder.\nAlternatively, you could use Workgroup Manager to add it as a login item.\n", "Q: How to easily and completely disable/enable WLAN (so it cannot be turned on again while travelling)? Without going into specifics of why I might like to do this, or whether this is a good idea or not, I would like to know how I can disable use of wireless networking on my MacBook Air, either via removal of software or drivers or similar, such that the machine is unable to connect to a WIFI network in any way without I undo those changes.  The intention is for the machine to be unable to communicate wirelessly when out of the house, and for those changes to not be easily reverted until I return (for example requiring some piece of external storage that does not travel with me and which contains copies of whatever I have removed).\nHow can I easily remove and then re-allow WIFI access (without losing my stored profiles/passwords or disturbing anything else)? Is it possible to simply copy a certain app or plugin to an external drive, delete it from my laptop, and later copy it back, again having everything as it was before?\n\nOne year later\nI have been happily using Daniel Lawson's solution below for quite some time now. I have created two applications with automator, one that deletes the .kext, one that restores it from an USB stick.\nFirst, copy /System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext to a USB stick and leave that stick at home.\nOpen Automator, select to create an \"Application\", then choose \"Utilities\" from the \"Library\", then \"Execute Shell Script\". (I'm translating this from my German menus, so the exact names may differ.)\nFor the \"Disconnector\" app, enter the following into the text area of the \"Execute Shell Script\" event:\necho YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD | sudo -S rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext\n\nReplace \"YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD\" by your admin password. Then save the app and drag its icon to the Dock.\nNow, when you are sure you want to be free of all online distractions, click the app icon, and the IO80211Family.kext is gone. Just restart your laptop and you can no longer connect to WLAN:\n\nFor the \"Reconnector\" app, enter the following into the text area in Automator:\necho YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD | sudo -S cp -r /Volumes/NAME_OF_YOUR_USB_STICK/IO80211Family.kext /System/Library/Extensions/\n\nReplace \"YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD\" by your admin password and \"NAME_OF_YOUR_USB_STICK\" by the name of your USB stick. Save the app etc.\nNow when you return home, insert the USB stick that carries the IO80211Family.kext into your laptop, click the Reconnector app icon and then restart your laptop. Now you can connect to WLAN again.\nNote.\nThere are some security issues invovled when you echo your admin password, because by that it is written to the shell history and can be found there. I don't care, but you might, depending on your circumstances.\n\nA: Discussions of willpower aside, my research suggests that the file you need to copy to the USB stick and later restore is /System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext. This will require a reboot to take effect.\nBefore removing any system files, be sure you have a working bootable backup of your system and time on hand to restore things should anything go wrong. I have not tested this solution on my system and am not willing to do so.\n\nA: I've answered similar questions before, so I'll just link to those for reference and provide a TL;DR here\n\"Anything you can do or install or configure in order to produce a technical block to stop you running these apps, can also be undone\", so the only real answer is to work on your will power.\nThe best you can hope is to try to make it more hassle than it's worth to mess around instead.  Try to create a new user account without any WIFI passwords stored etc, and force yourself to have to log out or switch users to procrastinate.  This isn't perfect, and it probably won't work.\nAs you say, you know the passwords by heart, so perhaps you will have to do something like set a static IP that won't route over the WIFI even if you connect because it will be different from the DHCP details you would normally be given, but obviously, as a technical measure, even this can be undone.\nIf this is a big big problem, you might need a combination of techncial workarounds that are backed up by another person you trust maintaining the administrator passwords to stop you from being able to undo the blocks put in place.\n\nA: Just delete the login credentials of the WLAN of the university library.\n", "Q: iMac G5 works very loudly. How to fix it? I only run Safari with maximum 3-5 tabs opened and the machine makes noise like a vacuum cleaner making it very hard to work on.\nAny ideas how to fix it?\n\nA: If you think that the fans are running at a higher speed that they should, you could try reseting the SMU.\nIf the issue is just with the sound being too loud, then the best option would be to open the computer and clean the dust, mainly from the fans and the ventilation-related. Even more, overheat could have caused the fans to slightly bend, making some annoying noises. If that is the case, the only option would be to replace it with a new one. Replacing the thermal grease could be helpful too, if you've got overheating issues. \n", "Q: How to persistently define aliases in Terminal I want to add aliases to my environment so that they are available in all Terminal instances.\nI got this answer:\n\nYes, you can put it in your .bashrc, .bash_profile or .profile. On some systems the shell init scripts also source .bash_aliases or .aliases so if one of those files exists on your system it may make sense to use them.`\n\nBut I cannot find any of these files.\n(I configured OS X to see hidden files, and yet I don't see any of the above 4.)\n\nA: Open a new Terminal window and go to your home directory (just type cd and press Enter). \nAfter that, type ls .bash* and also ls .profile (please note each of those file names starts with a dot). If you have those files (and you should have at least the .profile one) then you need to edit them and add your aliases to them. I use VI (or VIM) to edit those files, but you could use another editor (in fact typing in your Terminal window open .bash_profile will open it in TextEditor, which may be a bit more user-friendly if you're not familiar with VI). If, for some reason, you don't have any of those files, then create a new one (and call it .bashrc), add your alias lines into it (so this will be one command per line, as you would type them in shell) and then save the file. You can then create symlinks to .bash_profile and .profile by using ln -s .bashrc .bash_profile; ln -s .bashrc .profile. \nWhat I typically do is I make .bashrc and .bash_profile symbolic links to .profile and then just have to worry about one file only. \nThe difference between those files is that bash will source different ones depending on whether it has been started as a login shell (typically a login process would start the shell as a login shell) or as just an interactive (but not login) shell, or a non-interactive shell. Having all three files essentially the same gives me consistent environment regardless of how was bash started. \nYou will get more information by doing man bash, but be prepared, it's a long man page. You will be able to see which of the three files (.bashrc, .profile and .bash_profile) is sourced depending on which mode was bash started in. \nHope that helps - if not, give me a shout. \n\nA: Enter the following commands in Terminal:\ncd /etc\nsudo vi bashrc\n\nadd the following like:\nalias ll=\"ls -lrt\"\n\nFinally restart Terminal.\n\nA: If you use bash, add the alias commands to ~/.bashrc and save a line like this in ~/.bash_profile:\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nWhen bash is invoked as an interactive non-login shell, it reads .bashrc but not .bash_profile. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, it reads .bash_profile but not .bashrc.\nTerminal and iTerm open new shells as login shells by default, so many OS X users just use .bash_profile as their personal configuration file. For example tmux and the shell mode in Emacs open new shells as non-login shells though.\n.profile is also read by other shells like ksh. If both .bash_profile and .profile exist, bash only reads .bash_profile when it is invoked as an interactive login shell.\nSee https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html for more information.\n\nA: If you need this machine wide you need to look in the /etc folder. However, they may not exist by default, in which case you simply need to create them in the above folder and restart terminal. You will most likely need to use sudo to create them as the /etc folder is owned by root.\nIf you need this for every terminal you open you don't need to do it machine wide. You can create these files in your own home folder and it will be read by terminal every time you start a terminal session.\nAlso as mentioned in comments, you will generally only be able to see these using terminal and using ls -lha.\n\nA: I'm on the new Mac M1 processor.  I don't know if that's a factor in this case but I found that I had a file called .zprofile that actually got ran when a new terminal was created.\nI think in most cases you could find a file like this if you go to\ncd ~\n\nand do\nla -a\n\nI wanted to load my aliases in .bash_profile on startup so I put this into .zprofile\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nNow, I don't have to do that myself every time I get into a new terminal.

It looks like I can't solve the issue with contacts the same way.\nDoes anybody know how to use different contacts on different iPhones with the same Apple ID?\n\nA: The only reason I can see for sharing an Apple ID is to share purchases.  Otherwise as you have found out, you are sharing contacts, calendars, emails and maybe even video calls and imessages etc.\nLuckily, whilst all the above are iCloud functions, they are not mapped to your App Store account, and you can sign into separate accounts for each of these functions on your device.\nSo, on the assumption that the above is your scenario, then just sign into the App Store with the existing Apple ID which then is only responsible for purchases and download authentication etc., and then one of you can sign up for a separate free iCloud account to handle all the other functions.\n", "Q: Download Over Cellular?

When you run it, some of them succeed but the majority seem to fail due to error code -1731. Subsequent runs the same behavior happens until you have no more shufflable and bookmarkable tracks.\nI would expect that if the code errors on the first run it would keep erroring but that's not what happens.\nWhat's happening here?\n\nA: Add an explicit get to resolve the reference to the tracks:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat with t in (get tracks of playlist \"Listen Smart\" where shufflable is false)\n        set shufflable of t to true\n    end repeat\n    repeat with t in (get tracks of playlist \"Listen Smart\" where bookmarkable is false)\n        set bookmarkable of t to true\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nTry running a script like this:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    repeat with t in (tracks of playlist \"Listen Smart\" where shufflable is false)\n        t\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIf the playlist has three tracks where shufflable is false, the result at the end will be something like item 3 of every track of playlist \"Listen Smart\" of application \"iTunes\" whose shufflable = false. If you set the shufflable of the first two tracks to true inside the repeat loop, there won't be an item 3 where shufflable is false.\nIf you replace repeat with t in (tracks with repeat with t in (get tracks, the result at the end will be something like item 3 of {file track id 54774 of user playlist id 54771 of source id 73 of application \"iTunes\", file track id 54775 of user playlist id 54771 of source id 73 of application \"iTunes\", file track id 54776 of user playlist id 54771 of source id 73 of application \"iTunes\"}.\n\nA: As a complete hack, this seems to do the trick.\nNote that it's super unsatisfying so I'm still very interested in hearing a better response.\n", "Q: Can you share a Wi-Fi connection using Personal Hotspot? I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 6.1.3. I turn on cellular data + 3G and Wi-Fi constantly.\nI was at a site office today and my iPhone automatically connected to the office's Wi-Fi. The tech guy was not around to provide me with the Wi-Fi password to use on my Windows laptop. I then connected my iPhone to my Windows laptop using the USB cable and turned on Personal Hotspot on my iPhone.\nAt that point, is my laptop using cellular data through iPhone, or the Wi-Fi access point my iPhone is connected to?\nI noticed that my iPhone has the 3G symbol in the status bar. But when I disconnect the cable from my laptop, it switches to Wi-Fi.\n\nA: If you are connecting through the Personal Hotspot on iPhone, it will switch to using the cellular data network that your phone uses.  \nThis is the nature of how the Personal Hotspot feature is designed. See this article on Apple's website.\nSo in your case, your laptop was not piggybacking through the wifi connection on iPhone. It's an unfortunate design choice but as far as I know a current limitation. Maybe with a jailbroken device you could get past that but doesn't seem worth it for this case at all.\n", "Q: iMessage sync with the computer? I know that if you have an iPhone and an iMac computer/laptop, you can text off your iPhone, then once coming within a certain radius of your computer, iCloud uses Wi-Fi and sends the conversations to your iPhone. However, i was wondering what happens if the laptop is dead?  I assume it can't transfer the messages, correct? Also, I was wondering what happens if BEFORE you charge the laptop and turn it on, you delete the messages off your phone? Will they still somehow be transfered to your laptop?\n\nA: What happens in your proposed case is that if you delete messages from the iPhone, and then power on your Mac, the Mac will not receive those deleted messages.\nEDIT: Well, folks, I stand corrected. I certainly believed the above to be the case, but my tests proved otherwise. I sent several messages from multiple devices to other devices that were powered down. Each message was deleted before the recipients were powered back on. Although there was a significant lag in reception (one took nearly ten minutes), all messages that were sent were received, even those that were deleted.\nSeveral of the messages were out of sync, which doesn't surprise me given the flakiness of the iMessage system during its infancy. However, to the original question, the answer is that messages, deleted or otherwise, eventually find their destination, even to devices that were powered down when those messages were transmitted.\n(Hat tip to tubedogg for the correction.)\n", "Q: How to thoroughly waterproof a Macbook? I am just now coming to know the hard limits of water destroying equipment. I don't know if it's realistic to be able to have my Macbook as a floatable rubber ducky in the bath in this day & age, but products like Liquipel and commercials of scuba divers using iPads have me curious. \nIs liquipel the best protection on the market? Are there other custom shops that could do anything to make a MacBook either resistant to liquid or even waterproof?\n\nA: I'm going to stick my neck and say that you cannot do this.  No matter what materials you have to hand, your MacBook requires open access to the internals via vents and grills etc for fans to push unwanted air out, or suck cooler air in etc.  You can't safely just block all this up.  You can get a wide range of keyboard covers to allow you to type with wet/dirty hands etc, but protecting the entire unit isn't really practical at all. Servers are amenable to being bathed in mineral oil but that requires special cabling, removal of all blowers and potentially modifying the heat sink depending on the specifics of the CPU and coolant temperatures.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.grcooling.com\n\n*http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Server-Cooling-Hardware-mineral-oil,17348.html\n\nA: it's a very interesting prospect and my first thought was flashflood by nanostate\nIt would require fully dismantling the device which is difficult in itself but I doubt this would work on a whole macbook anyway because the screen would be hard to coat properly.\ndismantling a macbook ain't an easy task!\nThen there's the issue of how the heat generated by the processor and components would affect the coating, it could well negate the protection or worse damage the parts.\nAnd much like the previous answer the fans would be an issue the moment submersion occured because water is far more viscous than air so they'd burn out or be serious damaged by the water.\nIn regards to the point made about mineral oil submersion, this is totally possible because of the nonconductive nature of the chosen oils. Amari made this amazing fully submerged custom pc that used fluorinert and I remember reading about how hard it was to find pumps powerful enough to push the liquid around, once fully loaded the computer weighed something like 100KG!\nSo really a conventional laptop isn't something that could be easily made waterproof however because of the nature of ultrabooks using super low power processors it's only a matter of time before Apple release a Macbook Air without vents or fans making this a more feasible idea! You can guarantee the Liquipel guys will have attempted this or will in the future as no doubt there could be a lot of money to be made in waterproofing a laptop, I say this as I'm sitting outside and a dark rainy looking cloud looms above haha.\n", "Q: Docs needed to read before submitting app to App Store What are the documents one has to read before submitting an app to the App Store?\nI guess these are the two:\n\n\n*\n\n*App review guidelines\n\n*iOS human interface guidelines\nAre there others?\n\nA: Since Apple has a review process, you might just submit your app and react if there are problems in review.

Now she says \"I dont have a home number for John\" (this is my name). A friend is having the same problem. What has happened?\n\nA: I had similar problems, only Siri was not finding contact information of any kind, was not locating my friends, and not opening apps on command. I found that the problem was that Siri was having an issue with opening apps was causing all problems listed. To fix I used a Cydia app called iFile to locate the following files:\n/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.LaunchServices-045.csstore\n/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installation.plist\n\nDelete both the files, close iFile, and reboot device.

Did you mean these other names.\" Then she gives me a list of the all other Smiths except Joe. I thought it was a fluke, but it started to occur with other regularly used contacts. A restart did the trick at least for now. I only restart my phone when I get on a plane, so it had been three weeks since my last shutdown\n\nA: Go to Settings-> Mail, Contacts, Calendars-> My info \nand select the contact that you want to be matched with you. Be sure that this contact has a Home number. That's it\n\nA: Don't know if you resolved this, but I had this problem and discovered that Siri differentiates numbers labeled \"mobile\" and numbers labeled \"home\". Setting it to \"Home\" works, setting it to \"Mobile\" it doesn't.\nThis is the top hit for this question via Internet search so I hope this helps and I save some frustration out there.\n", "Q: How do I create a Folder Action Script to tar items dropped in folder?

But I'm clueless as to how this might be done. Reading now about tar and it's options as I'm sure there is an \"include\" function for pointing to a list of items to add to the archive.\n\nA: Rather than spending your time with Folder Actions (which I, and many others, have found to be unreliable), might I suggest that you give Hazel a try?\nhttp://www.noodlesoft.com\nDisclaimers: I'm going to start off by telling you it isn't free (it's US$28), but if you like automation, this is the place to start. There is a free 14-day trial. I am completely unrelated to the company except as an extremely happy user.\nHazel allows you to create 'folder actions' very easily using a nice GUI which is similar to creating Mail.app rules. You can take action depending on filename, extension, kind (i.e. \"images, documents, movies\") and many other.\nHere is the rule I use for any file/folder added to ~/Action/ZipIt/ \n\nHazel looks for any file which is not already an archive (I could have told it to act on any files at all, but I want to avoid compressing files which are already compressed). I could add other criteria (which could be options or requirements, like boolean \"AND\" or \"OR\" statements).\nWhatever it is will be archived, then moved to the Desktop, then it will be shown to me in the Finder.\nSee the little \"Options\" button next to the 'Move to Desktop'? Click on that and you can tell Hazel what to do if it detects that the file you are going to move is a duplicate.\nThere is also an option to have Finder brought to the front or not.\nThere are lots of other actions Hazel can do besides archive:\n\n(Note: iPhoto and Aperture are greyed out because I don't have them installed.)\nThe options to run AppleScript/Automator/shell scripts means that you have the power to do pretty much anything you can imagine.\nI could go on and on, but here's one more example: I have Hazel watch ~/Downloads/ for .zip files. When it finds them, it unzips them to ~/Action/Unzipped/ (you can do this either by telling Archive Utility to use that folder, or use The Unarchiver). Hazel then looks in ~/Action/Unzipped/ for new files which end with .app and, if found, moves them to /Applications/ and opens them. Voilà! Instant installation of apps.\nIn the world of 99¢ apps, $28 probably sounds like a huge expense, but to me Hazel is one of those tools which takes something Apple did, but not very well (Folder Actions), and replaces it with something that will make you wonder why Apple didn't do it. You get a 2 week trial, and a dedicated developer who has worked on this app for years, and who is very good at answering support questions.\nSorry to sound like a fanboi, but when it comes to Hazel and a few other Mac apps, I really am.\n\nA: Try:\non adding folder items to theFolder after receiving theAddedItems\n    set myList to {}\n    repeat with x in theAddedItems\n        set end of myList to quoted form of x's POSIX path & space\n    end repeat\n    set myList to text 1 thru -2 of (myList as text)\n    do shell script \"tar cvf \" & myList & \" | gzip -9 - > ~/Desktop/files.tar.gz\"\nend adding folder items to\n\n\nA: There is another option.\nInstead of a Folder Action (and the problems inherent with them), you could use QueueDirectories in launchd to call a shell script.\nFor example, this will call the script /usr/local/bin/mktgz.sh any time a file is put into /Users/foo/Action/Gzip\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.tjluoma.mktgz</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/usr/local/bin/mktgz.sh</string>\n    <key>QueueDirectories</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/foo/Action/Gzip</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI have a more developed version of this available at https://github.com/tjluoma/mktgz.\n", "Q: How to know what's my iphone 4s carrier using IMEI? I have an iphone 4s ios 6.1.3 my cousin bought it from U.S.A or so he says. He says the carrier is Verizon CDMA. However in the settings I see carrier: virgin 14.0\nI am outside the USA so i need a sim unlock, I contacted virgin USA, they said that the IMEI is not registered in the system, i need to contact apple they will unlock it.\nI contacted apple USA on the phone, they said they don't unlock phones, they only help with hardware issues, I need to contact virgin to unlock it!\nI contacted a local apple store, I asked them how to know whats my carrier? They said virgin 14.0 is nothing, not important, it doesn't mean that my iphone is virgin\nI gave them the IMEI and they are trying to see if it can be unlocked.\nI have some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to know what's the carrier using IMEI? My IMEI is 99 000266 076389 5 I tried to use an online IMEI checker, it only says service expired\n\n*How to know in which country it was registered? As you know virgin and other carriers are available in many countries, I want to know what support team I should contact.\n\n*Since the phone seems to be locked to the carrier, is there a way to know what's the iphone phone number was using IMEI? \n\n\nA: Indeed, Apple cannot provide you such information and they do not either unlock iPhones. This can be done only through the Mobile Network in which your iPhone is locked to, and you need to meet some criteria (I think they are different to every carrier). The number one requirement is to have paid all the monthly fees and you are the owner of that iPhone (That was very obvious).\nNow, in order to find out the Network that blocks your iPhone, you will have to find an online IMEI Checker, like the one it is mentioned in a previous answer. The free imei checker (unfortunately), are not always accurate (I have checked many times the same imei number, and in some cases [very few] the results were changing). There are some paid IMEI checker services, which are very cheap and in case of false results they will fully refund you. You can check the IMEI Checker I have used, and their results (Until now) are very accurate.\nI highly recommend to everyone to make those kind of checks before buying an iPhone from an online store. Unfortunately I learn it the hard way, so always double check what you are going to buy! :S\n\nA: Apple can't unlock your phone. That sort of thing is about carrier networks and it can only be unlocked by the carrier that the device is locked to.\n\nA: In this case, your best bet is to enroll the help of the carrier you wish to establish service.\nI believe Apple when they say that they do not unlock phones. I have never heard of an instance when someone in your position went to Apple and got an unlock. I have much experience asking AT&T, Verizon and Sprint to unlock a device and from what I understand, the carriers jointly maintain a database of IMEI that they (and their contractors) feed IMEI information and unlock status.\nApple sets up iTunes activation software that reads from this database, so in some indirect manner, I suppose a lawyer could argue that \"Apple\" is doing the unlocking, but in practical terms - they just honor whatever is in the database that the carriers maintain.\n\nA: Apple keep your iPhone information in their server. Basic this information can identify by Serial Number or IMEI number. But Serial number and IMEI number will change if phone replaced by repair.\nAbout iPhone information, Apple record this on database with active carrier (when you make purchase), and current carrier (carrier you are using on your phone) and this information can be change if you request unlock on carrier. Then carrier will request to change on Apple's database.\nYou can do check this information in some site like imeidata.net, basic they just fetch from apple server.

It may be set to have the numbers at the beginning of the title for some reason, and iTunes sorts album names that start with numbers after \"z\".\n\n\nA: Make Album = Album Artist = Artist.\nThose three attributes should be same.\nBackup your data before doing this.\nThis is the only method worked for me.\nI moved artist tag to comment tag for future.\n", "Q: Is it possible the create a pkg that doesn't require root access (user & password prompt) The title says it all really, is it possible to create a pkg that can install without the user requiring to enter their password?\n\nA: There's an option in PackageMaker.\nYou can still install into /Applications too, but the user would need to be in the admin group because the default permissions for /Applications are drwxrwxr-x+ 90 root  admin, so as long as the user is in admin then they'll have write permissions.\n\n\nA: You can't install into ~/Applications without admin access and password. In 10.7 and onward Apple changed permissions so even admins need password to install into /Applications, whether using installer or drag and drop.\n", "Q: Why Does CalendarAgent Access Strange Domains? Okay so I have OS X's Calendar app setup using a Google calendar, and I have Little Snitch installed so I am warned when an application tries to make unrecognised outgoing requests.\nWhat I'm seeing is that the CalendarAgent process occasionally tries to access Google domains that don't appear relevant, such as translate.google.com, feedburner.google.com or play.google.com, none of which seem necessary when I've already allow calendar.google.com.\nDoes anyone know why these domains are being accessed, and whether I should let allow them or just block/ignore them? When I temporarily block them it doesn't seem to affect anything, but it just seems weird for requests to go to these domains.\n\nA: I would say because those links are on calendar.google.com and Calendar app is following the links for some reason. When I go to calendar.google.com in a browser it has links for play and feed burner and translate. \n", "Q: iMessage no longer working on Mac after AppleID change I recently just got my first MacBook Air.

Is there any way to disable this dialog in Messsages or otherwise?\n\nA: This is more of a workaround. If you enable the \"Save history when conversations are closed\" option under Preferences->Messages, you won't be prompted when deleting conversations. \n\nA: You can hold Option and click Delete or (x).\n\nA: After reviewing the preferences as well as defaults, there does not appear to be a way to disable the confirmation message.\n\nA: I figured it out.....

You can find this in system profiler. \nIt will be something similar to this. \n\nIf your speed isn't 6 Gigabit but is 3 Gigabit then that would be why you aren't getting the speeds you'd expect. \n", "Q: Change window of an app while Drag & Drop Is it somehow possible to change the window within an application with ⌘+< (sorry, German keyboard here, I guess it's ⌘+` (?) on English keyboards) while Drag & Drop something? While it works between different applications it seems not to work within one application with multiple windows. It's especially annoying with small screens and a lot of overlapping windows.\nExample 1: Mark text in browser, drag it, ⌘+TAB to terminal (mutliple windows), ⌘+< to the terminal window you want to drop the text.

Is there a way to make the clip longer?  I thought of maybe looping it or duplicating it but I can't figure out how.  The slow motion option won't work either.  Do the presets in the movie trailers stop you from doing this?\n\nA: Looping is a function of the player (i.e., QuickTime).

Basically, MMS does not add EXIF data to the photo, but the iPhone, once it receives the photo, adds its own EXIF data, including the current date and time. \nSo, long story short, there is no specific data field that conveys whether or not a photo was sent via MMS.\n", "Q: Control odd-even page pairing in Preview in two-page mode By default, Preview displays pages like this in two-page mode:\n\nHow can I get it to display them like this instead?\n\nAcrobat does the latter but Acrobat is not nearly as responsive with this file as Preview is.\n\nA: I didn't find any way to display facing pages the other way in Preview.

How does it know of all the networks that are present in the location? How often does it check for the networks ? \n\nA: The 802.11 specification has a standard for Beacon Frames that get sent periodically to broadcast all the details about a particular hotspot.\nAll Apple hardware for Wi-Fi implements this specification and the radio just has to listen for beacon frames over a period of time and present those options to the software.\nI don't have a analysis or trace of the specific chipset within any iPhone, but my experience is that the device joins known networks within a second or so of coming into range of a network that is saved and set to be auto joined. Also, it would clearly start listening for beacon frames as soon as you turned on Wi-Fi from exiting Airplane mode, starting up or waking from sleep.\n", "Q: Multi-monitor: spaces thumbnails on external monitor missing I've been having the following issue since about two weeks:\nMy external monitor, containing the OS X title bar, does not show the thumbnails for my three spaces when in mission control.

I created the following folder:\n/Users/thi/bin\n\nI put my scripts in this folder, but if I type in the Terminal:\nmyScript\n\nIt doesn't run.\nI was told I have to export this bin path, something related to echo $PATH, but I don't know how to do it.\n\nA: You typically would put additional paths after $PATH like PATH=$PATH:/$HOME/bin because if you don't want to supersede another executable with the same name that might be in /bin, etc.\n\nA: You need to add the following to file ~/.profile:\nexport PATH=/Users/thi/bin:$PATH\n\nThen source ~/.profile\nNote, that you may need to create this file, and because it begins with a . it might not be visible in the finder for editing via an application like a text editor.  To list all files including hidden ones, use:\nls -la ~/\n\n\nA: If you use bash, add a line like this to ~/.bash_profile:\nPATH=~/bin:$PATH\n\nPATH is marked for export by default, so you don't need to use export.\nIf both ~/.bash_profile and ~/.profile exist, bash only reads ~/.bash_profile when it is invoked as an interactive login shell. ~/.profile is also used by other shells that might not understand the same configuration options as bash.\nTerminal and iTerm 2 open new shells as login shells by default. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, it reads ~/.bash_profile but not ~/.bashrc. The terminal emulators on other platforms often open new shells as non-login shells, so for example bash reads ~/.bashrc but not ~/.bash_profile. OS X users often use ~/.bash_profile as the personal configuration file corresponding to ~/.bashrc on other platforms, but it is also common to source ~/.bashrc from ~/.bash_profile or to tell Terminal or iTerm 2 to open new shells as non-login shells.\nYou can also change the path more globally in /etc/paths or /etc/launchd.conf, but in many contexts the path will still default to /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin. And I have only really needed to change the path in shells and text editors.\n", "Q: Will iMac G5 recognize external cd/dvd rom? The SuperDrive on my G5 used to read disks without problems, but now it thinks all the disks I insert are empty.

So I want to find an external CD/DVD-ROM and use it to install new OS.  \nMy question is (I'm new to Apple stuff): will it recognize the external reader without issues, just plug and play?\n\nA: You don;t say what OS version you are using on your G5, but if you use a standard non-fancy external USB attached DVD Rom drive, then I can't see any issues that would stop it from reading the drive an an OS level, but I'm not sure that this will be the case at the firmware level.

The account is linked, so my email is updating, but it won't sync the contacts.\nHow do I do it?\n\nA: There is an exact guide offered by copytrans (mentioned in the previous answer) which shows how to transfer iphone contacts to Outlook on a PC: http://www.copytrans.net/support/how-to-transfer-iphone-contacts-to-outlook/\n\nA: \nTo sync contacts with your computer, choose \"Sync Contacts with\" within iTunes for Windows, or \"Sync Address Book Contacts\" on your Mac.\nYou can sync your contacts with:\nMicrosoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, Microsoft Outlook 2010 (Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7)\n  Windows Address Book (Windows XP)\n  Windows Contacts (Windows Vista / Windows 7)\n  Address Book (Mac OS X)\n  Microsoft Entourage 2004, Microsoft Entourage 2008, or Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac\nNote: If using Microsoft Entourage, use Microsoft Entourage 2008 12.1.2 or later if syncing with Mac OS X v10.6 or later. If you would like to sync data on your Mac with Entourage, enable syncing between Entourage and Address Book.\n  Notes:\nWhen syncing contacts, you can choose to sync all of your contacts or only selected groups. The option to sync selected items may not show up until after the first sync.\n  You can select a group of contacts to which all new contacts created on your iOS device will be added.\nAdditional options for syncing include syncing your contacts with Yahoo or Gmail/Google Mail. You will need to configure it with the user name and password for your Yahoo or Google account.\n\nIf you want to import contacts without using iTunes, try using a third party tool to do so. We've used CopyTrans Contacts to do this. \nHere is a link to a video showing the process.\n", "Q: Faster Press and Hold Character Picker Does anyone know how to make the character picker appear more quickly? \nI use it enough now in my German language studies that it has become second nature for the critical marks and much faster than using the alt+keypress shortcuts. \nOnly problem is that it's so second nature that sometimes it doesn't pop up quickly enough so I end up typing the character and the number shortcut sometimes (IE u2 instead of ü). Anyone know how to make it appear with less delay? Ideally, I'd love if I could just hold the character and press the number but it appears that OSX insists on waiting for the menu to pop up.\n\nA: For completely other reasons I installed a keyboard remapping program called KeyRemap4MacBook and it solved my problem here. There is a tab called 'key repeat' for such customization. I had a hunch suddenly that since the Character Picker replaced repeating keys that maybe it would work. And it did. \nInstall the software and change the 'delay until repeat' option under that tab. Character Picker letter entry very nearly keeps up with the rest of my typing now.\n\nA: The \"Character Accent Menu\" settings can be adjusted under: \nSystem preferences -> Keyboard -> Delay Until Repeat\nIf you reduce this time, it's the fastest way to insert any accents in my experience. Setting the initial key repeat rate is the same as setting the time for the character accent menu to appear. With this solution, there is no need to change to international keyboards etc (see the other answers). see here. \nIf you set it to the minimum value, the delay will be 15 ms, which should be quite fast. However, there seems to be an actual delay of about 300 ms until the menu appears (maybe displaying the menu takes a while? Don't know). \n\nThere's people using scripts to set the delay from 15 to 1 ms, but I'm not sure whether this helps: see here: github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos, the relevant parameter is InitialKeyRepeat\n\nA: Just select the 'US international keyboard (pc)'. You can then enter accented characters the 'windows way'. So, if you want an é, just press ' and then e\nan ë is doen with \" and e and so on. This is by far the fastest way.\n\nA: Correction:\nSorry for not reading the question carefully. Judging from what you want to achieve, I can only come up with a way to use TextExpander. Basically, you need to create an abbreviation for each pair of accented character.\nFor example,\n\n\n*\n\n*a1 becomes à\n\n*a2 becomes á\n\n*a3 becomes â\n\n\nThen you can just type a1lpha which it‘ll replace the first typed a1 with à. You also need to make sure the abbreviations are expanded everywhere. The default setting only expand when the abbreviations comes after space. \nPrevious Answer:\nI’ve removed the summary, but I’ll keep the link alive. You can read more from the source.\n\nA: In OS/X, all languages have \"instant\" ways of entering the characters in that language without doing a press-and-hold, which does add an annoying amount of time it takes to type letters with diacriticals.\nYou just have to remember to set the right keyboard. If you don't see a small flag in the menu bar, open the Systems Preferences app, choose Keyboard, then make sure the \"Show keyboard...\" checkbox is checked. Under that same dialog, the \"Input Sources\" allows you to add new languages.\nOnce you do this, that keyboard will appear under that icon in the menu bar, and you can then select that keyboard anytime you want.\nThen, for example, to instantly type an accented A in Spanish for example, you just type a single quote followed by \"a\", which you can do as quickly as you can type.\n", "Q: How do I hide the parent folder of the user home folders in File Sharing? I'm running 10.8 server and I have a folder named Users and it is the parent folder for every local network user's home folder. Now, when the user connects to the server he sees his home folder, but also the parent folder Users. He can even list the contents of it.\nHow can I hide this parent folder? I don't want it to show up at all when connecting. The only thing the users should see is their home folder. Nothing else. Since the Users folder is the parent folder, it cannot be unshared.\n\nA: Mac is mostly unix under the hood.  Try setting the permissions of the /Users folder to everyone only execute.  \nE.g.

So it would be:\nalias ep=\"cd /Users/thi/Dropbox/CurrentProject\"\n\nMy question is, where should I put this alias? Inside /etc/bashrc? Or should I create a file called ~/.profile and place it there? Where should I put it?\n\nA: I keep aliases in ~/.bash_profile.\nTerminal and iTerm 2 open new shells as login shells by default. When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, it reads ~/.bash_profile but not ~/.bashrc. The terminal emulators on other platforms often open new shells as non-login shells, so for example bash reads ~/.bashrc but not ~/.bash_profile. OS X users often use ~/.bash_profile as the personal configuration file corresponding to ~/.bashrc on other platforms, but it is also possible to source ~/.bashrc from ~/.bash_profile or to tell Terminal or iTerm 2 to open new shells as non-login shells.\nIf both ~/.profile and ~/.bash_profile exist, bash only reads ~/.bash_profile when it is invoked as an interactive login shell. ~/.profile is also used by other shells and programs that might not understand the same configuration options as bash.\n/etc/bashrc is owned by root, and it might get replaced when you upgrade OS X.\nSee man bash|less +^INVOCATION or https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html for more information.\n\nA: Typically you put alias definitions into the same file as your $PATH definitions which is probably ~/.bashrc.\n\nTechnically speaking an alias is not a shortcut to a folder but for any shell command. So you can also have things like\nalias heal='xattr -d com.apple.quarantine'\nalias la='ls -lFa'\nalias ll='ls -lF'\nalias ls='ls -FG'\nalias show-path='echo -e ${PATH//:/\\\\n}'\n\nto make your life easier. Aliases are replaced as-is by the shell so if you run\nheal downloadedFile.dmg\n\nit gets expanded to\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine downloadedFile.dmg\n\nand executed afterwards. If you need more flexibility with parameters you may want to look into shell functions (but that probably should go into another question).\n\nA: i am not expert in bash but i think you should put your alias inside .bashrc in your home directory. \n\nA: The short answer is: (generally)\nAdd it to ~/.bash_profile\necho 'alias ep=\"cd $HOME/Dropbox/CurrentProject\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nNOTE: There shouldn't be any space between the alias/variable and the equals sign (\"=\") and the value. If your value has spaces then the whole value should be put in quotes.\nA better answer is: (probably)\nTry setting an environment variable, instead. This is probably more like what you actually want.\necho 'export EP=\"$HOME/Dropbox/CurrentProject\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\necho 'alias ep=\"cd $EP\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n\nNOTE: That environment variables are accessed by prepending the dollar sign (\"$\"). However, when being defined, the dollar sign (\"$\") should be omitted.\nAn alternative answer is: (possibly)\nSymbolic-Links. AKA. Symlinks. {FKA. Aliases. (Mac OS)}. {BKA. Shortcuts. (Windows OS)}.\nln -s <dirA/subB/fileC_in> <dirX/subY/symbZ_out>\n\nNOTE: symlinks are sometimes denoted by prepending the ampersand sign (\"@\"). \n\nA: This answer neatly summarises what ideally belongs in each of ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, and ~/.bash_profile. In summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile should be super-simple and just load .profile and\n.bashrc (in that order)\n\n*~/.profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as\nenvironment variables (PATH and friends)\n\n*~/.bashrc has anything you'd want at an interactive command line.\nCommand prompt, EDITOR variable, bash aliases for my use\nA few other notes:\n\n*Anything that should be available to graphical applications OR to sh\n(or bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile\n\n*~/.bashrc must not output anything\n\n*Anything that should be available only to login shells should go in\n~/.profile\n\n*Ensure that ~/.bash_login does not exist.\n", "Q: Access messages in Outlook's 'Drafts' folder I would like to use a message that is stored in the 'Drafts' folder as a template for other messages.

After that, what should I do so every time I open the terminal these files get read?\n\nA: You can use the touch command.\nFor instance,\ncd ~\n\nto go to the home directory.\nNow we will create a file called .bash_profile (the dot means that it will be hidden).\nThen use nano or vi in the Terminal. Unless you know what vi is, just use nano. To open up these files, you would use:\nsudo nano .bash_profile\n\nsudo makes sure that you will be able to save these files. Here, you can add aliases. nano or vi will automatically create a new file if it does not exist in your current directory in Terminal.\nAfter you are finished, press Ctrl + O, Enter, and Ctrl + X to save and quit. Finally, use\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nto reload the Terminal and it will read what you put in those files.\nOf course, you can alias that too if you want. :)\nTo answer your final question,\nthese files will automatically be read every time you open the Terminal. However, if there is an error (For instance, don't put spaces between aliases), it will tell you.\nMore Information\nAs George pointed out, .bash_profile will run only on login shells. For non-login shells, you would need to create a .bashrc file with:\n    sudo nano .bashrc\n\nLinks\n.bash_profile vs .bashrc\nImportance of .bashrc\n\nA: You can copy those files from /etc/skel/ which are skeleton files for new users created by command like useradd on Debian based distros:\ncp -nr /etc/skel/. ~/\n\nThese files will be automatically loaded by shell every time you log in. Way of loading those profile files is described in your shell manual page. In case you use bash shell in special way (e.g., via ssh, ansible, etc...) you should use 'bash -ilc command' if you want execute command in bash shell with ENV prepared by those profile files\n\n\n*\n\n*-i means interactive shell what is often required by .bashrc\n\n*-l means login shell which causes .profile to be loaded (or .bash_profile if exists - see manual page of bash) which then loads .bashrc (if interactive)\n\n\nA: You can also use a GUI text editor like TextEdit:\ntouch ~/.bash_profile\nopen -e ~/.bash_profile\n\nopen -e is a shortcut for open -a TextEdit.\nYou don't necessarily have to create .profile or .bashrc. Terminal and iTerm 2 open new shells as login shells, so bash doesn't read .bashrc. If both .bash_profile and .profile exist, bash reads only .bash_profile when it is invoked as an interactive login shell. .profile is read by ksh when it is invoked as an interactive login shell and by bash when it is invoked as sh as an interactive login shell.\nI have actually told iTerm 2 to open new shells as non-login shells, and my .bash_profile just contains a line like . ~/.bashrc. tmux and the shell mode in emacs open new shells as non-login shells by default. .bash_profile is still read when I ssh to my computer.\n\nA: I prefer to use GUI text editors such as BBEdit or TextWrangler.

If you want to start over and re-partition the disc, you can do that without erasing it first.\n\n*Once you have selected the disk or partition to format, click the Erase tab.\n\n*Choose the type of disk format you want (generally you can stick with the default, `Mac OS Extended (Journaled)').\n\n*Enter a name for the formatted disk/partition.\n\n*Click Erase.\n\n\nTo re-partition without erasing first:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the physical disk in the left-hand column. That is, the icon aligned to the left side of the window. Those indented are partitions on the physical disk. To re-partition you must have the physical disk selected.\n\n\n*Click the Partition tab.\n\n*Select a Partition Layout from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Give each partition a name.\n\n*Click the Apply button.\n\n", "Q: Doesn't Safari cache pages? Whenever I go back or forward in the Safari navigation history, it reloads the pages even when I just visited the page two seconds ago.\nWhen navigating using back/forward buttons or swiping back and forth, the app always reloads the page from the internet.\nCan I change anything to make Safari cache the pages I just visited more aggressively?\n\nA: The answer is no, Safari doesn't cache pages - it does however cache elements that make up a page when the rules that the web server associates with each element allows caching.\nYou can see this on your specific pages by turning on the Develop menu in Safari Preferences:\n\nAs you can see from this picture, the page where your question is posted allows many items to be cached and the load time for those elements is in the 0.1-0.3ms range. The items that are not cached have longer load durations so perhaps the pages you are navigating either have few items with cache enabled or the overall page load time is dominated by non-cached layout and content.\nIf you want to cache content for offline reading, use the Reading List feature to store the page for offline use. That does more aggressively cache much of the most pages to allow reading of the page while totally offline at a later date. In your case, when Safari is online, it will check to see that the reading list version of the page is current, so it might not be exactly what you are seeking.\n\nA: Option 1: Incompatibility with Safari Extensions\nDo you have any extensions in Safari?\nI was personally having this problem too. To fix this, I disabled all my extensions and it tuned out that AdBlock was causing this for me.  I have it disabled now and it doesn't reload when going back anymore.\nFor others who have no extensions:\nOption 2: Adding NoPageCache\nFrom an Apple Discussion Page:\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded NoPageCache from here\n\n*I closed Safari and reopened it.\n\n*I tried the app and it was still reloading pages.\n\n*I disabled and removed from safari the app (preferences/extensions)\n\n*Surprisingly it's not reloading anymore pages\n\nResources\nApple Discussion Page\nMany forums such as this one reveal that this is a bug in Mountain Lion. Many people have filed complaints but Apple has yet to do anything.\n\nA: The blue progress bar is a combination of contacting the server, downloading data, and drawing (rendering) the page in the window. If you click back, depending on your connection speed, connection lag, system speed and a bunch of other factors (how much is happening in the background, how much free RAM you have, etc) it may take a bit for the page to reload in the window, but this does not necessarily mean it is re-downloading all data.\nDisabling WiFi (or any internet connection) and trying to go to a URL will ALWAYS fail, because it can't perform the initial steps to determine what page to load (cannot connect to the DNS server). Whether or not Safari ultimately downloads the page again, it will always connect to the website server first to determine if the page changed since the last visit.\nYou can test if Safari is caching by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Safari menu > Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Advanced tab.\n\n*Check the box for \"Show Develop menu in menu bar\".\n\n*Close the Preferences window.\n\n*Load this wepage: http://trakt.tv/user/tubedogg. Once it is fully loaded, click Reload the current page in the Address Bar.\n\n*Press ⌥+⌘+I to enable the Web Inspector.\n\n*Press control+1 to show the Resources tab.\n\n*Click the disclosure triangle next to Images.\n\n*In the right-hand window, review the Request & Response section. (You may have to scroll down to see it.) Check to see if Cached says Yes or No.\n\n\n\nNote that not all images may be cached, depending on the instructions from the server. For example, some ads will tell your browser not to cache them. But if you review many or all of the images on the page, most of them should say Yes for Cached. This will determine whether or not Safari is caching correctly.\n", "Q: How is Adobe Update Notifier auto launched on Mac OS X? It seems the Adobe Update Notifier sometime autolaunches on startup, however I cannot find where it's launched from. I've checked in Lingon as well as my login startup items but it's not there.\nAny idea where else it could be? The full process is:\n\n/Applications/Utilities/Adobe Application Manager/UWA/AAM Updates Notifier.app/Contents/MacOS/AAM Updates Notifier -psn_0_127007\n\n\nA: This sort of file can also be manually deleted from the LaunchAgents or LaunchDaemons folders in the /Library Folder -  with Administrator privileges. This is where the intrusive apps like Adobe often install things--and sometimes apps that are really trustworthy. It's not a bad idea to look through these folders now and then, to see what might have been installed.\nThere is also a LaunchAgents folder in your User library, where agents sometimes get installed that you can simply trash if especially not wanted.\nIt is never a good idea, however, to mess with anything in the System Library.\n\nA: The updater is registered with the system service launchd. Instructions to completely disable this can be found on The real way to disable Adobe Updater from your Mac OS X:\nOpen a Terminal window and type the following commands:\ncd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\nlaunchctl remove `basename com.adobe.ARM.* .plist`\nlaunchctl remove `basename com.adobe.AAM.* .plist`\nlaunchctl remove com.adobe.ARM.Scheduler-1.0\nlaunchctl remove com.adobe.AAM.Scheduler-1.0\nrm com.adobe.ARM.*\nrm com.adobe.AAM.*\n\nNote that depending on your version of Adobe programs, some of the above lines may generate errors. That's fine.\nIf the above does not disable it, you may need to remove it at a system level. You'd use the same commands as above, but with two additions/changes:\nsudo -s\n[type your administrator password when prompted]\ncd /Library/LaunchAgents\nlaunchctl remove `basename com.adobe.ARM.* .plist`\nlaunchctl remove `basename com.adobe.AAM.* .plist`\nlaunchctl remove com.adobe.ARM.Scheduler-1.0\nlaunchctl remove com.adobe.AAM.Scheduler-1.0\nrm com.adobe.ARM.*\nrm com.adobe.AAM.*\nexit\n\n\nA: There is an additional thing that may be good to try with Adobe Manager: remove the Adobe Manager application from your Mac. After you do the steps below, you will receive a message that Adobe Manager is not installed in your computer when you start any Adobe software, but it will start normally. Please, find below the steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find where Adobe manager is installed. When the Adobe Manager application is running, you can find its path location listing the processes of OS X. The command in terminal is \" ps aux | grep Adobe\" . After this command you will see all Adobe processes that are running in your Mac.\n\n*Find the location of processes that have \" Adobe Manager \" in the line. Probably the files are in the folder called \"Utilities\" or something similar. If you have Dreamweaver or another Adobe application opened, it will be in the list too but you choose only the ones that have \"Adobe Manager\" in the line.\n\n*after it you have deleted the folders with Adobe Manager in the name. you can do it with Finder or in Terminal with the command \" sudo rm -R  \"\nI hope it helps. \n", "Q: Understanding copying package files I am seeing some unexpected results while copying package files in a shell script. There are two interrelated issues.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have commands similar to the following in a shell script:\ncp -rp path/to/package/file destination/directory\nThe problem that I am seeing is that sometimes the package is copied as a whole, which is what I want. Other times the package \"goes away\" and just the contents of the package ends up in the destination/directory. I don't see the pattern which is causing this to happen differently. Specifically, in the shell script, the package is copied as a whole. But when I try the exact command from the terminal, I get only the contents.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the shell script, while the package seems to be copied as a whole, it takes a very long time. Like 20 minutes to copy a 17MB file to a USB drive. When I copy the same package via Finder, it copies in about a minute. Then during testing when I rerun the script, it does not take 20 minutes, but just the minute.\n\n\nThese two results are unexpected. I would expect the same result each time, not varying results with the package verses package contents, and the time to run the script.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I'm not sure about #2, but I suspect #1 is due to trailing slashes in the file path. cp -Rp /path/to/Application.app /path/to/destination will copy the entire package, while cp -Rp /path/to/Application.app/ /path/to/destination (note the trailing slash after the source) will copy just the contents.\nBTW, you should use cp -R instead of cp -r -- in some implementations of cp they're the same, but in some versions the lowercase option has ... oddities. According to the man page on OS X:\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\nHistoric versions of the cp utility had a -r option.  This implementation\nsupports that option; however, its use is strongly discouraged, as it\ndoes not correctly copy special files, symbolic links, or fifo's.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to create an own MacPorts (proxy)repository/server? Is it possible to deploy MacPorts server on an own server periodically updating it from global one (i.e. create MacPorts distribution/update proxy server)? So that all computers within organization could access this server to install software and not the global macports server?\nIs it possible with Homebrew, Fink?\n\nA: You could probably in theory patch Homebrew to point to your internal Git server.  But it would still download the source for all the packages from their normal upstream locations.  You could bottle everything, but that would be a lot of work.  It don't think it would work very well.\n", "Q: IPhone 4 won't charge? When I plug it in, it doesn't charge. But when I turned it off and plugged it in, it turned on, but didn't charge. What's wrong with it? Is it the charger or the phone?\nUPDATE:\nthe charge is going up, but it doesn't say it's charging... I don't know if that makes sense. It doesn't vibrate when I plug it in, it doesn't have the charging symbol, and it doesn't have the charge on the lock screen, yet it's charging(?)\n\nA: most likely your 30pin dock port is full of dust and dirt, take a tooth pick, and verry carefully remove any dust that may have been stuck there.\n\nA: The cables go bad so easily, particularly 3rd party. Do you have another to try?\n\nA: With iPhone 5+'s lightning port (I know this isn't for that model but still could be an overlap), my problem turned out to be that lint was inside of my iphone's charger port and was blocking one of the pins from making a connection. Cleaned that out and the problem was solved\n\nA: It used to happen to me on my iPhone 4S. either force reboot your iPhone, pressing home button and power button for a few seconds, or switch it off for a few mins and then start it again. It fixes the issue. I am not really sure what causes it, i guess it sometimes does it on extended use of phone. \n\nA: My iphone was doing literally the exact same as the poster.\nI cleaned it out (using dry toothebrush) and It charged again!\n\nA: I don't think it's an issue of charger dock or cabl, as I understand your iPhone is charging but not showing any sign, right? If this is the situation then I'm confident that it's an issue of iOS. Have you tried resetting your setting only? I mean don't remove all the data and just reset the settings and check if it works. If it doesn't work then you should reinstall your iOS using iTunes and even if doesn't work then try these solutions to sort out the issue.\nImportant: Do not try to open or put any hard thing in your iPhone, you may damage it badly, if nothing work then simply take it to the repair shop.\n\nA: Mine was doing that too. Apparently, this is due to contact wear, so it needs more pressure closer to the home button to work.\n\nA: Same thing with mine, showed it was charging for 4 hours, but nothing changed. While it was still on the charger, I called it from my husband's phone and it worked! I guess the phone call to it \"woke it up\".\n", "Q: Applescript failing even though variables are equal I have a file that is a list of numbers like so:\n\n01\n02\n03\n04\n...\n241\n242\n\nHowever, this was generated from a list of files so I am not sure if it contains all the numbers in sequence from start to end, inclusive (Meaning it might be \"13 15\" instead of \"13 14 15\"). \nMy applescript checks for that, and although it seemed like it was going it be simple, my applescript fails at the number 10 and beyond, even though my dialogues say that the numbers x and y are both equal. And by fail I mean it is telling me the numbers 10 and on are missing even though it shouldnt be, because x is equal to y at that point.\nHere is my applescript, and the list can be found here.\nset x to 0\n\nrepeat 242 times\n\n    set x to x + 1\n    if x is less than 10 then\n        set x to \"0\" & x\n    end if\n\n    display dialog \"x is set to \" & x\n\n    #Get's the x'th line of the file and sets it to y\n    set y to do shell script \"sed -n '\" & x & \"p' ~/Desktop/numlist.txt\"\n\n    display dialog \"y result is \" & y\n\n    if y is not equal to x then\n            display dialog \"The number \" & x & \" is missing!\"\n        #exit repeat \n    end if\n\nend repeat\n\n\nA: Your x values are strings when the value is less than ten (because you use string concatenation to prepend a zero), however they are plain numbers when the value is greater than or equal to ten.\nYour y values are always strings.\nSo, for values less than ten, your final comparison compares a string to a string; this works as expected. For higher values, the comparison will always yield false because it is comparing a number to a string.\n\nIf you want exact string matches, then you can use use this comparison code:\nif y is not equal to x as string then …\n\n\nIf you only care about numeric values, then you could remove the zero-prefixing code and use this comparison:\nif y as number is not equal to x then …\n\nEquivalently, you could do the coercion when you fetch the y value:\nset y to (do shell script \"sed -n '\" & x & \"p' ~/Desktop/numlist.txt\") as number\n\nThe parentheses are necessary there because do shell script has its own optional as parameter that is not the same as normal coercion.\n\nA: Here's my two-cent's worth.\nIn the following code, the class (or type) of x is changed after contatenating the text \"0\" to it from an integer to text.\nset x to 0\nset x to x + 1\nif x is less than 10 then\n    display dialog \"At point 1, class of x: \" & (class of x)\n    set x to \"0\" & x\n    display dialog \"At point 2, class of x: \" & (class of x)\nend if\n\n", "Q: iTunes wants to delete my books I have just lost my laptop, the one that I use to sync all my books.

When I try to sync my books, iTunes wants to delete them all.\nI did not purchase any from iTunes because they don't sell books in my store. What can I do?\nMy iOS version is 6.1.3, iTunes is at the lastest version.\n\nA: The most maddening thing about iTunes is it's preference to delete things before. then, syncing them. \nOne thing you can do now is to be sure and make a copy of your books folder, perhaps in Documents. You might also back that up to Dropbox. iCloud has not proven itself to be a reliable backup in the cloud, no matter that it syncs quite nicely.\nHaving said all this, I'm not sure where you are seeing the 2.5GB, and where the 750MB. Generally, one refers to books, or e-books. iBook is a reader, as is the Kindle app, for example.

I am trying to use some init.d script under OS X and I while some are just working properly, I discovered quite a few that to rely on /sbin/start-stop-daemon and I am looking for a port of it for OS X.\nAny ideas?\nNote, I know that OS X does not have support for init.d but there is nothing stoping you from using it to start/stop some services. It is much easier to install things like postgres, nginx using brew and control them using the usual service name start|stop|restart.\n\nA: You need to look at launchd which uses *.plist setup files in:\n/Library/LaunchAgents/, /Library/LaunchDaemons/ and ~/Library/LaunchAgents/\nUnder /System/Library/LaunchAgents/ and /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ are the ones provided by Mac OS X.\nWhen you e.g. install postgresql form Macports, there will also be installed an org.macports.postgresql93-server.plist file under /Library/LaunchDaemons/ (it is a link to a .plist file which is installed under /opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.postgresql93-server), but the daemon isn't enabled at install.\nThe content of this .plist file is (the key <key>Disabled</key><true/> need to be set to false, if you need to enable the daemon):\n<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"\n\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\" >\n<plist version='1.0'>\n<dict>\n<key>Label</key><string>org.macports.postgresql93-server</string>\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/opt/local/bin/daemondo</string>\n    <string>--label=postgresql93-server</string>\n    <string>--start-cmd</string>\n    <string>/opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.postgresql93-server/postgresql93-server.wrapper</string>\n    <string>start</string>\n    <string>;</string>\n    <string>--stop-cmd</string>\n    <string>/opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.postgresql93-server/postgresql93-server.wrapper</string>\n    <string>stop</string>\n    <string>;</string>\n    <string>--restart-cmd</string>\n    <string>/opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.postgresql93-server/postgresql93-server.wrapper</string>\n    <string>restart</string>\n    <string>;</string>\n    <string>--pid=none</string>\n</array>\n<key>Debug</key><false/>\n<key>Disabled</key><true/>\n<key>KeepAlive</key><true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: Rene Larsen's answer holds the secret but it was not called out.

I have applications like Skype and Pidgin which start at login and are hidden, but when I have more applications running and I do ⌘ cmd + ⇥ Tab to switch between application these hidden applications also appear there.\nHow can I avoid showing them?\n\nA: Here is a blog post from someone who managed to remove Finder from the Application Switcher by adding this entry:\n <key>NSUIElement</key>\n  <string>1</string>\n\nTo the info.plist file of the specific app (in this case, Finder).\n\nA: The old app LiteSwitch X (Proteron Software) would allow you to selectively hide apps from the application switcher. For several years now it has been unsupported but I just googled for it and found a beta version that claims to add compatability for OS X Mavericks so it may work for you. \nBack in it's day I loved using it but since it went undeveloped for so long, I had to look elsewhere (and couldn't find quite as good of a solution). I'll be testing out the new beta version myself! Until recently, the best I've found—though, it doesn't solve your problem—is Hyperswitch.

I do not use the folders ~/{Downloads, Documents, Public} and so I remove them.  But some Mac OS X process keeps recreating them.  \nHow can I disable the creation of these folders permanently?  What process(es) are creating them?\nNote:  I do download files, e.g. from Safari, but they then go to a different directory.\nSafari allows this to be customized, so why can't the default directory be erased?\nNote:  I have run a crontab to delete these folders on a routine basis, however this\nis not a satisfactory solution especially since it needs to be run by root or an administrator.\n\nA: It's definitively not recommended to remove these directories because a lot of applications just assume they are there. But it's your computer of course, so you can do with it whatever you like.\nInstead of hunting down all applications/processes which might recreate these folders you could change their properties to make them invisible in Finder and inaccessible for everything :\nchflags hidden ~/{Downloads,Documents,Public}\nchmod 000 ~/{Downloads,Documents,Public}\n\n\nA: When you buy a certain thing, say, a Mac, you accept its parts to a large degree.

I purchased my iPad mini last January. Now the charger doesn't work so well and sometimes it doesn't work at all.\nDoes the warranty cover the charger? \n\nA: Short Answer\nApple warrants all hardware for one year in general. Depending on where you purchased the hardware, your warranty coverage and service options may vary. If an Apple Store is convenient, make a genius bar appointment and bring your iPad, cable and charger in case the cause isn't just the adapter. If not, you can find warranty service options online: https://locate.apple.com\nExplanation(Proof)\nFrom Apple's Legal Support Page:\n\nThis Warranty does not apply: (a) to consumable parts, such as\nbatteries or protective coatings that are designed to diminish over\ntime, unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or\nworkmanship; (b) to cosmetic damage, including but not limited to\nscratches, dents and broken plastic on ports; (c) to damage caused by\nuse with another product; (d) to damage caused by accident, abuse,\nmisuse, liquid contact, fire, earthquake or other external cause; (e)\nto damage caused by operating the Apple Product outside Apple’s\npublished guidelines; (f) to damage caused by service (including\nupgrades and expansions) performed by anyone who is not a\nrepresentative of Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider\n(“AASP”); (g) to an Apple Product that has been modified to alter\nfunctionality or capability without the written permission of Apple;\n(h) to defects caused by normal wear and tear or otherwise due to the\nnormal aging of the Apple Product, or (i) if any serial number has\nbeen removed or defaced from the Apple Product.\n\nAs you probably read, the quote above never mentions Apple branded accessories.\n\n\nApple Inc. of One Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California, U.S.A. 95014\n(“Apple”) warrants the Apple-branded iPhone, iPad or iPod hardware\nproduct and accessories contained in the original packaging (“Apple\nProduct”) against defects in materials and workmanship when used\nnormally in accordance with Apple's published guidelines for a period\nof ONE (1) YEAR from the date of original retail purchase by the\nend-user purchaser (\"Warranty Period\").

This is for buying purposes; i.e. does the kernel schedule the processes and threads belonging to every process, and do the apps save states that can be resumed at the user's discretion?\nPlease fill me in on the scheduling/structure of iOS's kernel.\n\nA: No - the multithreading of processes is reserved for Apple OS only and apps (including almost all Apple apps) do not get to execute simultaneously when they are not in the foreground drawing to the iOS screen. Only if the app calls some limited API (safari or other webkit apps downloading in the background is one of the white listed background tasks - FWIW) can the app get work done on it's behalf by the OS/kernel when the app itself is in a suspended state.\nThe iOS kernel is the same foundation as the OS X kernel, so your question about app suspend / resume state is more about the application frameworks in use than the underlying structure of the kernel.\nThat being said, the iOS idiom is to have apps paused by the OS at any time and various states are cached and saved so that once the kernel resumes execution of an app - whether it was paused for a few dozen milliseconds or a few hours is seamless to the user when the app is programmed correctly.\nOf course, not all apps adhere to this idiom, but most do.\n", "Q: Why does the external monitor on my MBPR constantly lose its signal? I have a Macbook Pro Retina, manufactured in August of 2012 (mid 2012). The laptop seems to be incapable of continuously driving an external display. On some monitors it will lose the signal once or twice a day; on my home monitor it will lose the signal many times an hour, sometimes taking minutes to \"settle down\". The effect is as if I had un-plugged and re-plugged in the HDMI cable. However I see this happen on three different monitors, two of which come in through HDMI and one through Thunderbolt. I even bought an apple monitor for $1000 that I returned, because on that one every now and then the MBPR just wouldn't detect it at all (and I would still see it quickly drop and re-establish the signal a few times an hour).\nHere is a video of what that looks like, as it flashes to blue repeatedly: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19671563/IMG_1363.m4v\nI tried gfxCardStatus and using Discreet Only, no luck.\nThe apple store guys were no help. They claim they have never heard of this issue even though I repro it daily. When I check the Console, this is the first message I always see during an incident (for the worst-performing monitor, at least):\n8/24/13 4:30:01.312 PM WindowServer[82]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003d\nI have tried every conceivable Display setting (Best for Retina display, Best for External display), and I am mirroring. I never had even a single problem on my older Macbook Pro; I have had problems since day 1 on my MBPR and they are getting worse (i.e., the external monitor is losing its signal more frequently every day).\nCan anyone recommend a solution or suggest a cause?\n\nA: I was able to resolve this issue by using this $10 adapter: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A8DSY2/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nFor whatever reason, the MBPR likes the monster adapter much better than the Dynex DVI to HDMI cable I purchased from Best Buy. Now I use a DVI to DVI Dynex cable connected to a Monster adapter and it is much more reliable. \n", "Q: Email encryption options on an iPhone I've started taking security more seriously lately. (Why only now you may ask? Because I'm a trusting fool that's why.) I've now got emails signing automatically and encrypting where I have their key. \nPreviously I only did this when necessary, but I'm trying to breed a sense of change around me and taking my own medicine seems sensible. I have no issue with GPG in Thunderbird, Outlook, or on Android with K9 Mail & APG, but I have no idea how to handle GPG on IOS. \nI can't accept there's no way, it seems ridiculous, or maybe I'm approaching the problem wrong and there is a more appropriate route than GPG that's better supported?\n\nA: Try oPenGP.\nFeatures (as listed at iTunes page):\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Decryption / Verify.\n  \n*Encryption & Sign.\n  \n*Clear sign.\n  \n*Fully compliant with GPG & PGP® Desktop software.\n  \n*Text message (armor format) \"Decryption / Verify\" and \"Encryption & Sign\" through Clipboard (copy & paste), iOS Documents interation (ex:\n  iOS Mail.app -> oPenGP), Email, SMS, Dropbox, \"My Files\".\n  \n*Files (.pgp or .gpg files) \"Decryption / Verify\" and \"Encryption & Sign\" through iOS Documents interation (ex: iOS Mail.app -> oPenGP),\n  Email, Photos, Dropbox, \"My Files\".\n  \n*Local folder \"My Files\", to store encrypted documents inside oPenGP, can be managed through iTunes file sharing.\n  \n*OpenPGP/MIME renderer (RFC 2045 Plain UTF-8 message bodies, RFC 2046 Attached files), for reading mail with attached files sent with\n  GPGMail (open source plugin for Apple Mail).\n  \n*Automatic extraction of decrypted archives (.tar .gz .zip .7z .rar) included in OpenPGP/MINE format or in .pgp .gpg files.\n  \n*Ability to preview all decrypted files (Ex: .png .jpg .pdf .doc) or to send them through iOS Documents interaction (ex: oPenGP -> Quick\n  PDF).\n  \n*Importation of PGP keys (.asc files) through iTunes file sharing, iOS Documents interation, Clipboard, Dropbox.\n  \n*Search & import public keys from server (hkp).\n  \n*Secured keyring storage.\n  \n*Secured passphrase cache.\n  \n*Lock application with a passcode.\n  \n*Auto encrypt to myself.\n  \n  \n  Features NOT supported, but on roadmap:\n  - Trust, verify, sign & update public keys on servers (hkp).\n  - Creation of secret/public keys.\n\n\nA: Try iPGMail.\nMore here.\nFeatures (copied from iTunes app store):\n\nPGMail is an app that implements the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880) and\n  allows the user to create and manage both public and private (RSA and\n  DSA) PGP keys and send and receive PGP encrypted messages.\nPGP Keys and Messages can be passed to iPGMail several ways:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*From the iOS Mail.app - The iOS mail application will pass PGP attachments to iPGMail directly, eliminating the need to do an awkward\n  copy-and-paste. NOTE: PGP messages that are part of the main body of\n  an email will still have to be copy-and-pasted, only properly tagged\n  attachments can be passed automatically.\n  \n*Directly from the system clipboard. Copy-and-paste the PGP message text from any file, webpage, or message, and it can be imported and\n  decrypted by the app.\n  \n*iTunes File Sharing - Connect your device to a computer and open up iTunes, in the \"Apps\" section, you can scroll down and select iPGMail\n  under the File Sharing section and transfer files to and from the app\n  to your computer.\n  \n*DropBox - Starting with iPGMail v 1.14, you can link iPGMail to a dropbox account and transfer files to and from your dropbox file\n  space. This means you can encrypt and protect your dropbox files or\n  share files with others through your existing dropbox Public\n  interface.\niPGMail supports PGP key generation (RSA) directly in the app and\n  stores them securely using the iOS keychain for the application. Using\n  your own private PGP keys, you can encrypt and/or digitally sign any\n  messages. Optionally, your public key can be attached to any message\n  you send from the app so that the recipient can then import it into\n  their own keychain, either on the phone or on any computer with PGP\n  support.\niPGMail will import your private keys so you can reuse your existing\n  PGP identity and keys on your iPhone or iPad. Both public and private\n  keys can be imported through the interfaces listed above.\niPGMail allows the user to search public SKS PGP keyservers to find\n  registered public keys for other people with whom the user can then\n  send email that is digitally signed and/or encrypted encoded in\n  OpenPGP ASCII Armor.\nThis app is ideal for securing your files or for sending secure email\n  messages to specific parties without worrying about it being viewed by\n  anyone other than the designated recipient.\n\n\nA: PGP is a fantastic standard and has many uses and great implementations, but if you want to sign and encrypt email with a minimum of fuss, I think you'll find as I have that S/MIME is more well-supported.  Many mail clients (including the stock Mail app on iOS and Mail.app on OS X, and other popular clients such as Microsoft Outlook) can handle S/MIME out of the box with no addons.   Email certificates are authenticated by a CA, like SSL certificates for the Web, instead of requiring you to rely on the PGP web of trust to authenticate others' certificates and have them authenticate yours.\nYou can get a free S/MIME certificate from StartSSL.  Once you've created it, you can export it from your browser (be sure to use a passphrase!), email it to yourself, then open it within the iOS mail application to install it.  Your Mail account settings will then offer options to use the installed certificate to sign and/or encrypt your mail.\n(I have no affiliation with StartSSL, other than as a satisfied (non-paying) customer.)\n\nA: You don't necessarily need a program to do encryption. Yes if you want PGP you'll need one of the programs above.\nIf you want to have simple signing and encryption just get a certificate (free email cert is available from Comodo) and upload it on the phone.\nOnce added a verified mark will appear in your contact card for the corresponding email address. Now you can go into mail account setting and enable encryption and signing. \nOnly downside is that you can't activate / deactivate per message. You have to restart mail app once signing or encryption is activated / deactivated.\nThe same process goes if you have a mac / OSX and are using the native mail app.\nCheers,\nZ.\n\nA: Try And You And I, a free app that provides instant and rapid S/MIME enabling with and for your iOS device.\nThe blog explains the concept behind my app, as well as some technical details and tipps for S/MIME on iOS.\n\nA: Try my app: EasyPGP for iOS\nhttps://easypgpapp.com\nIt integrates with the iOS keyboard and lets you encrypt / decrypt within any app your using.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/easypgp/id1270644569?mt=8\n\nA: Try Tessercube.\nFree on App Store and Google play.\nAlso open sourced already here https://github.com/DimensionDev/Tessercube-iOS/\n", "Q: Continuing a \"stopped\" iCloud restore on iOS I was restoring my iPhone 5 to the latest iOS and chose restore via iCloud. The restore process - especially for apps - was frustratingly slow and actually stopped frozen after a while.\nAfter trying several other options, I finally \"Cancelled\" the iCloud Restore operation and then manually installed the apps via iTunes, as well as synced songs, etc.\nNow for some of the apps, data is missing and my Photos also appear to be incomplete. Since I \"cancelled\" the iCloud Restore (and was warned about not being able to do this again), is there any way at all I can coax iCloud into streaming the app data back into the installed app folders, as well as getting my photos? Would there perhaps be two separate ways of doing that?\nOr is the only other option to \"Erase Content and Settings\" and do the restore process all over again, allowing Photos to restore gradually via iCloud, while installing apps via iTunes parallely (without \"Cancelling\" the iCloud restore)? \nIf the answer to the last question is \"Sadly, yes\", then can it be assumed that if the app is installed via iTunes anyway, iOS will proceed to restore the app's data from iCloud? Or does the app HAVE to be installed OTA for the data to also be restored from iCloud?\n\nA: iCloud could be slow in restoring especially if you have lots of app data and your WiFi is not Speedy Gonzalez. I have some bad experience restoring with iCloud as my Photos app and Spotify app are both more than 5 GB each. \nThere is absolutely no way to let iCloud take over from where it left. You need to do the restore anew. \nI'd suggest, the next time backing up via iTunes or an alternative such as Copytrans Shelbee. The restore will go rather quicker as it is done over USB. The backup in iTunes is exactly the same as with iCloud (including app data).\n\nA: I agree the easiest path is to reset with \"Erase Content and Settings\". In my experience, restore what you can with iTunes first, i.e. update all your iOS apps in iTunes so the phone doesn't also have to update apps later after restore.\nAfter the iOS reset, try skipping the initial iCloud account and password prompts. After you restore your local settings from iTunes, then perform an iCloud restore, this should have an overlay effect applying the latest differences from the cloud and should minimize what is needed to be downloaded by the phone.\niOS/iTunes restores are not smart about prioritizing what is important first, probably since that differs for everyone, e.g. Mail and photos are important for me, next is app data, esp. passwords.\nFinally, if you do keep local backups with iTunes, make sure it's an encrypted backup, not for security, but a lot of app data will simply not backup without encryption.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the best solution is to do a restore on your iPhone to get everything back the way it was, assuming that your files where synced successfully to iCloud. I usually deal with OSX so I'm not as familiar with IOS so I cannot suggest any fixes from the phone itself. If you had the photo's, data, apps etc... on your computer you can sync them from iTunes, if not then you will have to do a restore. Stopping those things in mid install will cause nothing but trouble......\n", "Q: Mac Server setup for small office We have a Mac Mini with OSX server for our small web design company's office.

How to change it?\n\nA: You need to specify the permissions when executing mount - the local file permissions or the permissions you set with chmod on the directory to which you mount your share will not be taken into consideration. \nYou should do mount -t <fs_type> -o m=755 /path/to/source /destination\nI'm not sure which filesystem type is what you're trying to mount (is it nfs? or hfs?) - you only refer to a host system and a guest system without any more details. You'll need to specify the correct file system type to the mount command (but I'm presuming you have already done that and it did work). Also, it would be a good idea for you to read the man for the relevant mount command (so, if the fstype is hfs, you'll need to read man mount_hfs; similarly, if it's nfs, you need to man mount_nfs; have a look at the bottom of man mount for more fs specific mount commands). \nHope that helps!\n", "Q: How do I sync/merge my local Xcode git repository with a remote git repository?

Is there a way of specifying that Time Machine only backs up under certain circumstances - i.e. Ethernet connection is active...?\n\nA: This AppleScript will check if the Ethernet connection is active, and then run a Time Machine backup if so.\nFirst, disable Time Machine in System Preferences. The below method will run it automatically.\nWhile connected to Ethernet, you will need to run one command manually to confirm which interface Ethernet is assigned to. Run this command:\nifconfig\n\nIt should output a screen full of information. What you are looking for is a section labeled en with a number after it, and whose last line is status: active, like this:\nen1: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING>\n    ether 00:25:00:ef:30:3c \n    inet6 fe80::225:ff:feef:303c%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5 \n    inet 192.168.1.68 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    media: autoselect (100baseTX <full-duplex>)\n    status: active\n\nNote the number next to en at the beginning - this is the interface that your Ethernet connection is running on. In the script below, where it says en9, replace 9 with the number from above. (If you have a Mac Pro, it will most likely be en0 or en1. Otherwise, it will likely be en0.)\nif (do shell script \"ifconfig en9 | awk '/inet/ {print $2}'\") is not equal to \"\" then\n    do shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/backupd-helper &\"\nend if\n\nSave this as EthernetTimeMachine.scpt into your home folder (/Users/<yourusername>/).\nNext open up Terminal and type the following command:\npico ~/crontab\n\nThis will open up a text editor to allow you to schedule this script to run on an hourly basis, just like Time Machine does by default. Paste this line:\n@hourly osascript ~/<yourusername>/EthernetTimeMachine.scpt\n\nPress control+X then type y and press return to save and exit.\nTo disable it, go back into Terminal, again use the command:\npico ~/crontab\n\nThen delete the line you added above and use the same steps to save and exit.\n\nA: This is an alternative to the other script I posted. This one runs in the background and tests the network connection every two minutes to determine if it is using an Ethernet connection or wireless. If on Ethernet, it enables Time Machine; when the connection switches to wireless it disables Time Machine.\nStep 1: System Check\nWhile connected to Ethernet, you will need to run one command manually to confirm which interface Ethernet is assigned to. Run this command:\nifconfig\n\nIt should output a screen full of information. What you are looking for is a section labeled en with a number after it, and whose last line is status: active, like this:\nen1: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=b<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,VLAN_HWTAGGING>\n    ether 00:25:00:ef:30:3c \n    inet6 fe80::225:ff:feef:303c%en1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x5 \n    inet 192.168.1.68 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255\n    media: autoselect (100baseTX <full-duplex>)\n    status: active\n\nNote the number next to en at the beginning - this is the interface that your Ethernet connection is running on.\nStep 2: Create the AppleScript Application\nIn the script below, where it says set wired_interface to \"0\", change the 0 to the number next to en in the above output. (It should be 0; if you are on a Mac Pro, it may be 1.) Also in the below script, at the top where it says myusername, substitute your own Mac username.\n-- Edit variables here --\nglobal current_username\nset current_username to \"myusername\"\nglobal wired_interface\nset wired_interface to \"0\"\n\n-- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --\nglobal last_connection\nset last_connection to \"wireless\"\n\non idle\n    if (do shell script \"ifconfig en\" & wired_interface & \" | awk '/inet/ {print $2}'\") is not equal to \"\" then\n        -- on ethernet\n        if last_connection is equal to \"wireless\" then\n            -- turn TM on\n            -- else do nothing, we're still on ethernet\n            set last_connection to \"ethernet\"\n            do shell script \"sudo /Users/\" & current_username & \"/TMSwitch/TM_On.csh\"\n        end if\n    else\n        -- on wireless\n        if last_connection is equal to \"ethernet\" then\n            -- turn tm off\n            -- else do nothing, we're still on wireless\n            set last_connection to \"wireless\"\n            do shell script \"sudo /Users/\" & current_username & \"/TMSwitch/TM_Off.csh\"\n        end if\n    end if\n    return 120\nend idle\n\n⌘+s to save. In the Save property sheet, set the File Format as Application, and check the box for Stay open after run handler. Save it wherever you like - Desktop, or Applications Folder - it really doesn't matter, just know where you saved it.\n\nStep 3: Create the Shell Scripts\nNext, open Terminal. Type the following commands:\ncd ~/\nmkdir TMSwitch\ncd TMSwitch\npico TM_On.csh\n\nPaste the following line in:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine AutoBackup -bool TRUE\n\nPress control+x, type y and press return to save and exit. Then run this command:\npico TM_Off.csh\n\nAnd in this file paste the following line:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine AutoBackup -bool FALSE\n\nAgain, control+x, then y and return to save and exit.\nNext, enter these commands:\nchmod 4555 TM_O*.csh\nchown root TM_O*.csh\n\nStep 4: Setting Up sudo to Run Without a Password\nLetting the Terminal command sudo run without a password can be very dangerous. That's why the steps above created the shell scripts in their own directory, so what can actually be run is limited.\nEnter the following command in Terminal:\nsudo pico /etc/sudoers\n\nThen enter your administrator password when prompted.\nThis may bring you to a (mostly) blank screen, or it may have some text in it. If it's blank - that's fine. You'll just paste the below line at the top.

Now you can extend the size of the Macintosh HD by dragging the resize bar at the bottom right it can extend to take up the space formerly occupied by Untitled 3 and it won't affect your bootcamp partition.\n\nA: There is no way to merge partitions with Disk Utility. You can resize/extend partitions for your Macintosh HD, but not for Bootcamp.\nIf you look at this link, it gives you several options for programs that will resize your bootcamp partitions. All of them involve cloning your Windows installation and then restoring it back on a partition after you delete both partitions and then tell Boot Camp Assistant to make a new partition for Windows 7. After, you can simply restore the cloned Windows 7 image back onto the partition and it will boot up with the extra space.\nI have used this process myself to extend my Bootcamp partition.

I placed it in rice for a while, and it started working again, but the screen was extremely dull. Every day after that that I used it, the screen steadily got worse and worse to the point where I couldn't even tell what the background was anymore. Since then, it has sat untouched. I plugged it in today, and the screen is static-y and grey and indistinguishable. It still functions, but I can only tell due to my own memory. Is it worth anything?

I have setup a VPN connection by using my FritzBox WLAN Cable Router. I'm using this on my iOS devices to protect me from Wifi honeypots. Just by coincidence I switched VPN on on my device while on the 3G network and didn't notice it. Now I'm wondering: why would I if I want to switch off this great feature? Does it have a negative impact on performance, battery life or network speed?\n\nA: When you use a VPN to send all your traffic to another network, you are reducing the ability of the internet to route your packets directly from your phone to the servers and instead are forcing the network to put the packets the VPN embeds to travel first to another network and then to the destination.\nIn the case where you need to hide / encrypt traffic, this downside is clearly worth bearing. For general purpose use, you will almost always add latency and perhaps bandwidth constraints that make the network response slower - even assuming all the encryption is done in hardware and has no effect on battery life on the device nor on performance due to delays in the encryption / decryption.\nAlso, your network is far less resilient and you have introduced a single point of failure (the VPN termination) into your path to the internet.\nThese downsides can be mitigated when you apply VPN to some traffic as opposed to all traffic and ensure your VPN is well connected to the internet.\nIn some cases VPN speeds the network if the traffic you send elsewhere is throttled and the traffic to the VPN is not throttled, but this is an edge case and worth considering, but rarely a reason to use VPN exclusively.\n", "Q: How to configure VPN per app in iOS 7? As one of the business feature the upcoming iOS 7, Apple has announced the ability to configure VPN on application basis.\nHowever, details about this feature are hard to find on the web.\nI am wondering, if this configuration will be something that can be done on the Device itself, or if it has to be something that has to be set up by an IT administrator in the network?\n\nA: Here's how I understand it. Mobile apps that run on iOS 7 can indeed be set up to (either manually or automatically) connect via VPN, but the devices have to be managed with OS X 10.9 as the backend VPN server and MDM. This is intended to separate the corporate connection (which may be carrying sensitive data) from the personal one.\nFunctionally, a payload (XML file) will be pushed to the iOS device. The VPN payload is designated by specifying com.apple.vpn.managed as the PayloadType value. The VPN payload contains VPN connection information, but relevant to VPN-By-App, the OnDemandMatchAppEnabled key is enabled: \n\nIf true, the Per-App VPN connection starts automatically when apps\n  linked to this Per-App VPN service initiate network communication.\n\nAdditionally, there is a VPNUUID key:\n\nA globally-unique identifier for this VPN configuration. This\n  identifier is used to configure apps so that they use the Per-App VPN\n  service for all of their network communication.\n\nAnd a SafariDomains key:\n\nThis array contains strings, each of which is a domain that should\n  trigger this VPN connection in Safari.\n\nSo, the short answer to your question is Yes.\n", "Q: Finder window pops up every time Time Machine makes a backup I have configured a shiny new Time Capsule a few days ago. It runs firmware 7.7.1 and my Mac is on 10.8.4.\nThe Time Capsule works perfectly so far, except that every time Time Machine makes a backup, a Finder window showing the contents of the “Time Machine Backups” volume pops up (see screenshot).

That blocks pings to localhost on all my Mac OS systems. Go to System Preferences, Security & Privacy, Firewall, Firewall Options...  \n\nAlso, if you have \"Block all incoming connections\" that might also affect things. I would certainly turn off LittleSnitch since it also can and will block that sort of traffic if you haven't allowed it.\n\nA: Most likely it's your Mac OSX Firewall. \nGo to System Preferences / Security & Privacy / Firewall and see if it's on. If it is, turn it off for a moment and see if you can ping localhost (please note, before you can turn the Firewall off, you'll need to click on the padlock in the bottom left corner and authenticate). \nDon't leave your Firewall off though, unless you're absolutely sure that your Mac is not exposed to any external traffic at all (i.e. it's really only safe to do that when you're in a completely isolated network).

And I need space on my iPod, so if I deleted all the pictures from photostream, will it delete pictures from their iPhone? I don't want to delete any of their items. I'm totally confused as to why it keeps doing that even after all this time. \n\nA: Check and see whose Apple ID is being used by iCloud. Go to Settings -> iCloud -> Account. The Photo Stream associated with your device should be the one associated with the iCloud account that is logged into the same device.\nAlso, deleting items from the device will delete them from whichever user's account is associated with iCloud on the device.\n", "Q: Excel 2011 Opens Spreadsheet As Read-Only I have a spreadsheet (.xlsx) file that, when I open it on my MBP running Excel 2011 14.3.6, I get a pop-up telling me the file is locked and can only be opened in read-only mode.  About a minute later, Excel opens another pop-up and this time says that the file is unlocked and asks if I want to edit it.\nI've triple-checked permissions on the file and it's definitely editable by me.  I've also verified in Get Info -> General that it's not locked.\nThe file is located on a USB flash drive.  I created a copy of this file on the local drive (/Users/aj) and it will open fine without the warning.  Other Excel files saved on the USB flash drive open without this warning.  A copy of this file on the USB drive still has the warning.\nWhat can I do to remove the warning?  I use this file all the time and it's super-annoying.\n\nA: Does your file name contain a /? For example, if you take thisfile.xlsx, and make it into this/file.xlsx, it will only open as read only. I verified this on my own Mac.\n\nA: Whilst the first answer did not apply to the opening post, I'll use the old bugs in Microsoft Office to exemplify how a file that is read-only in an Excel window is not an open file. \n@AJ. (opening poster): given the available information, multi-platform use of different versions of Excel is the likeliest cause of problems in your case. Please see below, Persistence of temporary files …\n\nMicrosoft Excel 2011 problems with POSIX-compliant use of HFS Plus by OS X\nExcel 14.4.7 (141117) allows the user to include the solidus character / (slash) within the name of a file in, for example, the Save dialogue:\n\nSimply saving then closing the workbook with that file name will cause the file to be read-only, to Excel, for as long as there's a character that Excel can not handle. \nEditing the saved workbook, before initial closure, may expose additional bugs – one of which is shown at end of this answer. \n\nOther causes of Excel treating a workbook as read-only\nUse Terminal with ls(1) and lsof(8) to tell whether any lock-related file is present for the affected workbook; and to tell whether anything other than Excel has the workbook open. \nPlease note that lsof is executed as the superuser. \nApproaches to opening/locking\nNot all apps use the same approach. \nExample 1: a workbook file.xlsx opened first by NeoOffice then by Microsoft Excel: \n\nExcel responds properly to the Mac OS X native file locking of NeoOffice: \n\n\n*\n\n*the Excel window to the workbook is read-only\n\n*output from lsof confirms that the workbook is not open by Excel.\n\n\nAlso in the screenshot above\nThe COMMAND column shows that two processes have the file open: \n\n\n*\n\n*soffice.bin – here, that's NeoOffice\n\n*filecoordinationd – for system-wide file access coordination.\n\n\n\nExample 2: the same workbook file.xlsx opened first by Microsoft Excel then by NeoOffice:\n\nNeoOffice responds properly to Microsoft's approach to locking: \n\n\n*\n\n*the NeoOffice window to the workbook is read-only\n\n*output from lsof confirms that the workbook is not open by NeoOffice\n\n*output from lsof confirms that lock file is not open by Excel.\n\n\nEssentially\nUse lsof to discover what has the workbook open. If not filecoordinationd then it might be a third party backup or synchronisation application, or a metadata-related process … and so on. \n\nPersistence of temporary files\nA temporary file may remain in the file system longer than necessary. \nIn example (2) above we see ~$file.xlsx – a companion to file.xlsx – such files are normally invisible to Finder. \nIf an (invisible) ~$….xlsx file is present following (for example) a crash of Excel on your own Mac, then Excel should behave properly when the (visible) workbook is next opened. \nIn contrast: if for any reason an ~$….xlsx file persists after closure of the workbook by another installation of Excel, then Excel on your Mac may respond strangely. With reference to the opening post –\n\n… About a minute later, Excel opens another pop-up and this time says that the file is unlocked and asks if I want to edit it …\n\n– that symptom is very familiar to me from shared use of a workbook served by Microsoft Windows Server to Windows and OS X clients. \n(In my case, accepting the prompt to edit rarely allowed edition; there reappeared the alert about read-only access, then another prompt to edit, and so on … and that behaviour would persist after all users had closed the workbook. Resolved only by manual removal, from the server, of the invisible ~$….xlsx file.)\n\nBack to the bugs in Microsoft Office\nThe solidus / in an existing file name prevents Excel from opening the file (the window to the file is read-only): \n\nThat's relatively innocuous. \nHowever, edition following the initial save may present a succession of problems. Screenshots below show AutoSave/AutoRecover failure –\n\n\n\n– the workbook is saved and remains open (confirmed with lsof) but the behaviours are disconcerting to the end user. \n", "Q: Understanding Photo Stream I have some questions about Photo Stream:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are the photos that I take with my iPhone kept in the camera roll and PhotoStream folders? (Sometimes I take a photo and it appears in camera roll but not on Photo Stream, why?)\n\n*Are all the photos I take on my iPhone automatically uploaded and saved on my iPhone? How can I be sure?\n\n*What happens when I delete a photo from the camera roll or Photo Stream? Do they disappear from my iPhoto library?\n\nA: How Photo Stream Works\nIf you have Photo Stream enabled on both iPhone and iPhoto, any picture you take on iPhone is automatically uploaded to Photo Stream, and the automatically downloaded to iPhoto. iPhoto must be open for this to occur (but don't worry, the photos stay in Photo Stream for 30 days or until 1000 more pictures are taken, whichever comes first, so you don't have to have iPhoto running constantly).\nUploading Photos to Photo Stream\nPhoto Stream only uploads from iPhone while connected to WiFi. Occasionally a picture is missed, and as of now (August 2013) videos are never uploaded. There is no way to trigger an upload later if a photo fails to upload to Photo Stream. You can, however manually sync iPhone with iPhoto to sync videos as well as any missed photos.\nSyncing iPhone with iPhoto Manually\nPlug iPhone into your Mac then in iPhoto, click on your device in the left sidebar. There will be an Import button. It will automatically skip any photos previously imported from Photo Stream. Once imported you can choose whether to remove them from Camera Roll on the phone. If you do this, make sure you are syncing them back to iPhone in iTunes if you want them on the phone in albums.\nDeleting Photos\nDeleting from Photo Stream\nWhen you delete a photo from Photo Stream, it removes it from Photo Stream entirely. If it was already downloaded into iPhoto it will remain there under the (MonthName Year) Photo Stream album, but not in Photo Stream itself.\nDeleting from Camera Roll\nWhen you delete a photo from Camera Roll it removes it from that area but does not delete it from Photo Stream.\n\nA: the discrepancy may occur due to you taking the photographs whilst using cellular data. Unless you specifically tell your iPhone to upload the photos using cellular data, they won't upload until you have a WiFi connection. if you take a bunch of photographs whilst you have no WiFi, connect your iPhone to WiFi, (this will automatically happen anyway) open photos and go to your photo stream. scroll to the bottom and you will see all your photographs uploading one by one (they will appear at the bottom). I hope this goes some way to explaining! In my own experience, I have never experienced photo stream missing any photos however, it does not work with videos!\n", "Q: Disable ALL password prompts in Finder I FREQUENTLY mess with system/hidden files in /Library, /System, /bin, etc. and I'm tired of constantly being prompted for my (20+ Alphanumeric character) password. I'd like to have my \"Administer\" user account have all permission like root. I know it's a \"security\" hazard, but my network is locked down, drive is file vault 2 encrypted, and password is crazy complex (good luck dictionary brute-forcers). I can run Finder as root, but how can I make it the default behavior in 10.8/10.9?\n\nA: Do It Yourself: Option 1\nOpen a Finder window in Column View. Choose Go To Folder from the Go menu. In the sheet that comes down, type /System/Library/CoreServices. You'll see two Finders there. Click on one of them (just one click!) and make sure it doesn't say \"Classic Application\" in the preview pane. If it doesn't, then that's the one you want. Hold Option and drag it to the desktop (because you want to duplicate it).\nNow rename that app to RootFinder or something. Move it to your /Applications directory. That's all the setup; the only part you have to repeat is from here on in.\nOpen the terminal. Type:\n    cd /Applications\n    sudo open -a RootFinder.app\n\nEnter your admin password at the prompt. Note that your desktop picture will change, and a new default Finder window will pop up. Your original Finder windows or other running apps won't be affected, however. Now, you cannot move files from one Finder to the other, but as long as you're using only the root finder (opening new windows will open them as root finder, obviously), you have full root access to the bowels of your system and you can browse directories and copy/move files much more easily.\nTo get back to where you were, open the Terminal again. Type ps auxc | grep Finder and then sudo kill [PID] and enter the PID of the Finder. The Finder will automatically relaunch in your original account, and your desktop picture will change back.\nSource: Create a GUI Finder with root access\nThird Party App: Option 2\nWould you be interested in LaunchAsRoot?\nFrom their website,\nHow to use\nDrag the application (or a document) you wish to launch as root on top of the LaunchAsRoot application icon in the Finder.

I've used Preview to do this, but it resulted in a huge file size because the image was always copied. \nIs there any way (app, command line) short of Adobe Acrobat (too pricey) to duplicate a pdf page while just referencing the image? \n\nA: You can duplicate pages in preview by opening up the sidebar to display thumbnails (View->Thumbnails), click on the page you want to duplicate, and then hold down Option and drag the thumbnail to the new location.  That will create a duplicate of the page and leave it at the new location.  When you do it this way, it does NOT duplicate the internal images and assets, but will reference them on the new page.  I just confirmed with a one-page PDF which had a 400k scanned image: I turned it into a 6-page document which was still around 400k.\nIf you instead add the page you wish to duplicate with Edit->Insert->Page From File... it loads all the assets again and does not reference the ones you'd already loaded, causing the file size to balloon.

What information is gleaned from conducting an Apple Hardware Test ( or Apple Diagnostics for Macs purchased from June 2013), when trying to find out if something is wrong with my Mac ?\n\nA: The Apple Hardware Test only detects problems with the computer's internal hardware components (logic board, memory and wireless components) not external components nor software-related problems. \nIf the AHT displays an error it will be a hardware failure of any kind, which, in most of the cases, will be solved by replacing the component. So if you were to contact any Technical Support regarding this issue, providing this information could be helpful but most likely unnecessary. \n\nA: As Thecafremo stated in the first answer, AHT/Apple Diagnostics will only show \"No trouble found\" or provide you with an error code assuming it detects a failure.\nApple Hardware Test (AHT) essentially runs minor stress tests on the major internal components and sensors in your Mac.  The standard AHT test runs quick memory tests, fan tests, Mac wide sensor tests and a very brief hard drive read/write & SMART status test.  AHT also has a checkbox for an extended test, which runs the same tests as before but expands it's memory & hard drive tests, running full pattern tests on RAM and a longer disk scan on the hard drive.  The extended test takes a significantly longer amount of time, 1+ hours compared to 5~ minutes, than the standard test.  While it runs you will hear your different fans spin up to full speed for a few seconds and a progress indicator on the screen tells you what component it is currently testing.  Assuming no failures are found it will present a \"No trouble found\" message once it's finished.  If failures ARE found then AHT will return a cryptic error code that can be deciphered using the info below, pulled from an excellent CNET article:\n\n4ETH: Ethernet controller\n4IRP: Main Logic board\n4MLB: Logic board controller\n4PRC: Processor\n4HDD: Hard disk\n4MHD: External disk\n4YDC: Video card\n4SNS: System sensor\n4MOT: Fan motor\n4MEM: Memory module\n4AIR: AirPort wireless card\n\nThe below info, pulled from the same CNET article, can help you isolate specific sensors when the 4SNS error is returned.  The first letter should either be L for current, T for temperature or V for voltage, indicating the type of sensor. The second letter (A, e, M, etc) refers to the component area where the sensor is located.  So, using this along with the info below, we can assume that 4SNS....TH.... error would be the hard drive's temperature sensor.\n\nA: Ambient air sensor\nB: Battery\nC: Central processors (CPU)\nD: DC (direct current)\ne: PCI-express slot\nF: FireWire port\nG: Graphics processor (GPU)\nH: Hard disk\nh: Heat pipe (heat sink)\nL: LCD display\nM: Memory or memory riser boards\nm: Misc.

If errors are detected it will explain in terms along the lines of \"There appears to be a problem with your hard drive\" but can still return a cryptic reference code.  Apple Diagnostics gives you the option to reboot to your recovery disk though and to contact Apple's support site for options on resolving any errors found.\n", "Q: Can iPhone 4S' digitizer be fixed? My iPhone has broken LCD glass, LCD is working from inside but I think the digitizer is broken.\nI have visited many blogs and websites and most of them described to replace all the screen with LCD and digitizer. I want to know if there is a way I can fix the digitizer or do I need to replace the whole package?\n\nA: The LCD and the digitiser are a single integrated piece and cannot be separated for repair. As Alex said above you would have to replace the entire lot. \nThis forum post over at iFixit a very popular iPhone/apple/computer repair blog and shop highlights the fact this cannot be done. \nhttp://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/25507/Can+I+separate+the+glass+from+the+LCD+screen\n\nA: You should be glad that your LCD is working fine, else it would be a huge mess for you. You can't fix digitizer, you need to replace it. It's quite simple and you can do that on your own. Here is a blog link that will give you a step by step guideline on how to change your broken and damaged digitizer / Screen.\nhttp://blog.brokenlcds.com/replace-iphone-4s-broken-screen/\nWhen it comes to its worthiness, here is a site that buys smartphone broken LCD screens / digitizers (including iPhone 4, 4s and 5).

Awful Network Performance I have a MacBook pro running Mountain Lion. When I copy files over the local network, I get around 200Kb/s on a 1Gbps link (the light on the switch indicates 1Gbps). This morning I went to download the XCode 5 DP6 and was pretty apalled by 50Kb/s. Downloading from a Windows 8 machine connected to the same switch yields 2.2Mb/s.\nI've tried running the following, but is there anything else I could try?\nsudo sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=0\n\n\nA: Several things:\nDo a TCP Dump to analyze traffic, to see if you're machine is hitting sites that are bogging it down. At the command line, type sudo tcpdump -i en1\nDo a DNS cache reset. At the command line, type sudo dscacheutil -flushcache\nCheck the MTU settings.

If after rebooting your Mac there are still no output devices listed in System Preferences > Sound try running a system report. \nYou can access this by choosing About this Mac from the Apple () Menu and then pressing the System Report... button.\nOn the left of the System Report window there should be a section for Audio.  If you select that you will get a list of Audio devices.  If that is empty you most probably have a hardware fault and need to take your Mac to an Apple Store for repair.\n\nA: You may try resetting your SMC and NVRAM, which controls power for various components as well as retains settings for a few pieces of hardware.\nTo reset the SMC on your Mac Mini:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your system and unplug all cables (including power cable)\n\n*Wait 15 seconds at least\n\n*Plug power and other cables back in\n\n*Boot machine\n\n\nTo reset the NVRAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your Mac.\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P,\nand R.\n\n*Turn on your Mac.\n\n*Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you\nhear the startup sound.\n\n*Hold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup\nsound for a second time.\n\n*Release the keys.\n\n\nAside from that, running an Apple Hardware Test by holding D on boot, then running through the prompts to validate if an issue has been found with the actual hardware for the sound.\n\nA: Problem was solved automatically when i updated with latest version of OS.\nThanks for your valuable answers and response.\nThan\n", "Q: Deleted usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib -- computer won't start Long version:\nI mistakenly deleted usr/lib/libxml2.2.dylib and now the computer will no longer start (it just stays in startup mode indefinitely). Would the solution be to reinstall the operating system? The computer came with Snow Leopard and have since upgraded to Mountain Lion. If I reinstall the Snow Leopard version (given that's the one I have a disk for) am I in danger of losing anything on the hard drive?\nShort version:\nI actually have the correct version of libxml2.2.dylib saved on the Desktop, so if I could get into the computer I may be able to fix the problem.\n\nA: If you still have the Snow Leopard Installation DVD you should be able to solve the issue by booting from DVD and then open Terminal to copy the missing file from your desktop (which will be in /Volumes/however-your-disk-is-called/Users/Dash/Desktop) back into the correct location (/Volumes/however-your-disk-is-called/usr/lib/).\n", "Q: During Install: unexpected Arabic text in Elevated Permissions Dialog … why? Can anybody explain this, and more importantly how to solve it? It only appears to be the dialog that comes up asking for elevated permissions when installing an application, and everything works as expected, even though the text coming up is wrong.\n\nI'm running OSX 10.8.4 on an iMac, language settings wise I now have only British English installed, everything else has been removed.\nRunning sudo defaults read -g AppleLanguages produces:\nThe domain/default pair of (kCFPreferencesAnyApplication, AppleLanguages) does not exist\n\nAlso it doesn't seem to be all installers. I've just installed a new Canon printer, and the dialog requesting elevated permissions came up as normal.\n\nA: Mixed localizations like this have been reported fairly frequently in Mountain Lion, Arabic being the most common.  Normally it can be fixed by just going to system preferences/language & text/language and using the Edit button to remove Arabic.\nHaving only British English on that list may be risky, because the OS has no British English localization, so something else has to be used.

These terminal programs are interrupting the work I'm doing in other applications while they run.\n\nA: In my case it was the Maven Failsafe Plugin that caused the annoying window focus stealing of ForkedBooter, and setting the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS variable in .bashrc didn't help.\nThis fix applies to both Failsafe and Surefire (although in my case, Surefire wasn't stealing focus).\nIn your pom.xml, add a <argLine>-Djava.awt.headless=true</argLine> line inside the <configuration> for the failsafe (and/or) surefire plugin.\nIt will look like this:\n<!-- this is inside your <project><build><plugins> block -->\n<plugin>\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>${maven.surefire.plugin.version}</version>\n    <configuration>\n      <includes>\n        <include>**/unit/**/*Test*.java</include>\n      </includes>\n      <!-- prevent the annoying ForkedBooter process from stealing window \n        focus on Mac OS -->\n      <argLine>-Djava.awt.headless=true</argLine>\n    </configuration>\n  </plugin>\n  <plugin>\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>${maven.failsafe.plugin.version}</version>\n    <configuration>\n      <!-- prevent the annoying ForkedBooter process from stealing window \n        focus on Mac OS -->\n      <argLine>-Djava.awt.headless=true</argLine>\n      <includes>\n        <include>**/integration/**/*Test*</include>\n      </includes>\n    </configuration>\n    <executions>\n      <execution>\n        <goals>\n          <goal>integration-test</goal>\n          <goal>verify</goal>\n        </goals>\n      </execution>\n    </executions>\n  </plugin>\n\n\nA: As @patrix has suggested, it seems I'm only having this problem with Java processes. \nThis answer over at StackOverflow seems to solve the problem\n\nA: Can you run your terminal program in the background?

I'm trying to upgrade from my MacBook Pro's original HDD to a SSD. Right now my external HDD, which I installed OSX Mountain Lion on, has to be plugged in to boot. If I unplug it, I get a white screen with a flashing folder icon upon boot up.\nI open disk utility and it shows my samsung SSD, which I just repartitioned to use Mac OS Extended (journaled)\nEDIT\nI click finder and it shows under devices: \"OSX\" which is the name I gave my external HDD currently running OSX.. and \"Samsung SSD.\" OSX has the standard folders on a mac.. Samsung SSD is blank.\nHow can I get OSX to boot from my SSD rather than the external HDD? Thanks!\nWould doing this get it to do that?\n\n\nA: It looks like Disk Utility is being extra cautious and not allowing you to unmount the boot drive to copy it. Assuming your copy of Disk Utility is running from the OSX external drive, you will have to power down and try booting into Recovery.\nNormally, you press Command R to enter recovery but I haven't tested with no recovery partition on the internal drive, so you might instead boot holding option to see if the OS can find a recovery HD on the external drive.\nIf you partitioned both drives and have no viable recovery, you will have to use internet recovery or otherwise get a bootable OS that isn't the one you are attempting to copy.\nWorst case, return the bootable drive to the inside of the Mac and run an OS installer to re-install the OS onto the SSD. That will make a proper Recovery HD partition that will allow you to boot and run Disk Utility without needing a bootable OS separate than the two drives you want to copy. \n\nA: As suggested by tubedogg, use a program, such as SuperDuper! or Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) to clone your data from the HDD to the SDD. This should result in a bootable copy. However, be aware that SuperDuper! does not copy the hidden OS X recovery partition (not sure about CCC). If you also want that, you should carry out the procedure, explained by bmike, first. \nAlso go to \"System preferences > Startup Disk\" and make sure your Startup Volume is selected there.\n", "Q: Apple USB Keyboard not working on 27\" iMac (Intel Core i7) I have two similar iMacs (27\" - i7 - os10.8.4 ) and use Apple's extended USB keyboards on both of them.

OS X uses hidden files (prefixed with a . dot when using ls -la) to store meta information on the folder (position and sorting of the icons for example). To have a precise breakup of your directory size use\ndu -h /Users/azz0r/Sites/Personal/php-rest-api\n\nin Terminal. You can limit the depth of displayed files with the -d DEPTH option.\nTo see the hidden files recursively from a directory use the ls -laR command.\nTo show hidden file directly in the finder, you could also follow this post Show hidden files Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: Why do only some images received via iMessage have GPS data? I've noticed that only some of the images I receive from a friend of mine (who also has an iPhone 5) have GPS data.  (I test this by saving the picture and using a photo app to read the metadata.)\nI can't figure out why some do and others don't.  My friend is not changing his settings or doing anything weird.  This is all through iMessage.  \nThoughts?\n\nA: If Location Services are on for the Camera.app, EXIF data will include GPS data. If it is not, it will not for photos that are taken with Camera.app. Location data can be inserted on an app by app basis. I tested, for example, Camera.app, and Camera+. The former had Location Services disabled, and the latter was enabled. As expected, the former had no GPS data, while the latter did.\nFurthermore, photos that are downloaded from other services may or may not contain location data. For example, Facebook strips GPS data out of photos, while Photobucket does not.\nAny testing I have done has been with an iPhone 5, and also an iPad mini.\n\nA: For the EXIF data to arrive via iMessage, ALL the recipients must have iDevices.  If even one of them doesn't then it gets stripped out by Apple for everyone\n", "Q: can I get log into an iPad without using security code? I would like to know if there is a way to use someone's iPad without having to type in the security code.\n\nA: No. The security code prevents use unless you can find a way to crash the security or hack into the device.

Depending on how Mail is looking at a recipient's address, it may include brackets around it and/or include the person's name, in addition to the actual email address. These strings wouldn't match just the email address, obviously. Using Contains instead allows it to match the string you know should be there - the email address - no matter what Mail is actually matching against.\n", "Q: Can my daughter charge my credit card from her Apple ID? If I set up an individual account for my daughter can she charge my credit card with an app purchase?\n\nA: If your credit card is associated with her Apple ID, yes. \n\nA: Is Apple ok with it? - yes\nWould I do it? - probably not\n\nIf my daughter was young, I'd gift her an allowance and augment with larger gifted apps when needed or have some gift cards handy (you can often get them at 20% off at warehouse stores and online from time to time). If she were older, I'd want to get her a credit card account either on her own or tied to mine so she can start on managing her finances.\nIf neither of the above options makes sense for you, you most likely you will be able to specify your billing address on her Apple ID. Should you be comfortable giving her control over your credit card to make purchases, it's your decision which accounts you choose to store that billing information and who has access to the password and security questions.\nI would say that if you want to use that credit card with other Apple accounts, you might find one or both locked so it might be easier to set up an allowance or get her her own credit card (in your name or hers) number so that she has a cleaner setup.\nApple does use the name on the billing contact for the default name on Game Center and some other places, so your daughter might be not only spending your money, but representing you in some of her online activities.\n", "Q: Why did Apple Decide not to install Command Line Tools as default? Why did Apple Decide not to install Command Line Tools which now have to be installed through xcode?\n\nA: To answer your question, not many (relative term here) OS X users will install or have any need for command line tools because it is part of a larger group of tools to download. A large majority of regular, everyday OS X users won't be using these programs.

I accidentally moved some files around within a folder on my desktop. I pressed command Z to try and un-do the action (I may have accidentally hit some other keys in the process, I don't know,) but instantly the folder was wiped of it's contents and even the name of the folder changed to \"Untiled Folder.\" It seems my files have just vanished into thin air and I can't get them back.

Sometimes you may want to see the differences in folders in order to:\n\n\n*\n\n*See what files are different\n\n*See what files are missing\n\n*See what files have been added\n\n\nWhich may prove useful if you wish to keep the contents of two folders the same, or to show if files have changed between the local and remote copy of the folder.\nIs there a way to show this comparison using Terminal or otherwise?\n\nA: Yes. The diff command will do exactly what you want. To use it just type diff -rq and either drag the folders you want to compare into the terminal window or type the folders' path yourself. \nThe -r is to recursively compare any subdirectories found, and the -q toggles diff into brief mode. Without it, diff, will not only tell you which files are different, but also the actual line-by-line differences for any text files that exist in both locations but are not identical.\nOn the other hand, Kaleidoscope is a great Application to compare text, images and folders in a very neat and clean way.

Apple doesn't like to give the actual CPU model designations, but Google can help us here, and we learn that the two CPUs are the i7-3740QM and i7-3840QM. Googling again for the difference (http://lmgtfy.com/?q=i7-3840QM+vs+i7-3740QM) finds that in addition to clock rate, there are differences in cache sizes. But within the first page of hits on that search, you can see benchmarks that show nearly identical performance for the workloads tested.\nIn short, I wouldn't spend $250 more for that CPU. (But I wouldn't buy a retina MBp either. :)\n\nA: Very basically, this value designates the speed at which your computer's CPU runs. The faster the CPU speed, the faster, in general, the computer can process data.\nIn practical terms, the amount of memory, and the presence of a solid-state drive vs. a traditional HDD will make more difference in the performance of your computer than will a .1 GHz difference in clock speed.\n\nA: There are multiple factors on which the clock speed depends such as the number of cores, cache memory, architecture etc.Clock speed is the rate at which a processor executes a task and is measured in Hertz, Megahertz or Gigahertz (GHz). One cycle per second is called as “Hertz”. Gigahertz (GHz) means 1 billion cycles per second and when you talk about 2.4 GHz processor, you usually mean that this is the maximum frequency of the clock to each core which is 2.4 billion cycles per second.\nBut if one CPU is dual core having 2.6ghz of speed and another one is a quad core having 2.5 GHz speed then obviously the second one will be faster because each core is going to have a speed of 2.5 GHz which means 4 cores * 2.5GHz.\nReference: What does GHz in processor speed mean?Clock Speed of Processor\n\nA: I won't begin to guess what you might spend the $250 on if you didn't get that CPU bump, but most people should buy everything else they need (AppleCare, cables, software, cases) before paying to upgrade the CPU when there isn't a documented need to make money on a known task that would save time due to increased CPU speed.\nThe larger question is how to map Apple's CPU to Intel and whether industry benchmarks that will show a faster CPU does more math actually translates into an observable effect for the average (or for a specific) user.\nI would say you could get good advice from the following resources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.macworld.com\n\n*http://www.tomshardware.com\n\n*http://www.anandtech.com\n\n*http://www.mactech.com\n", "Q: Is there a way to use Ricoh1200s printer with OSX?

To make matters worse it does not allow me to browse/select the real app located in /usr/local/Cellar.  \nThis doesn't seem to be asking to much here, any ideas on how to change this?\n\nA: Not the cleanest solution, but pressing / while in the Open With dialog allowed me to get to /usr/local.  Found the solution here\n", "Q: Merging Two Folders Into One in OS X? When trying to drag various items into a folder in Finder in OS X and some of the items have the same name, OS X will ask if you wish to replace the items in the folder you are dragging to.\nHowever if you wish to merge the files from the first folder to the second folder:\nHow do you accomplish this ?\n\nA: If the folders are the same name, drag one to the location of the other, and BEFORE releasing the mouse or trackpad, hold down the Option key. You will be presented with three options, one of which is to Merge.\n\n", "Q: Using Finder To Arrange Applications By \"Application Type\" Finder is intuitively designed to help you find things on your Mac. In Finder Windows you can arrange icons or lists of files in all manner of ways: Name, Date last opened, Created, Modified etc, as well sort lists in Ascending or Descending order by clicking on the top column title.\nHow do you therefore go about arranging Applications by \"Application Type\" ie Productivity, Music, Video etc....... ?\n\nA: In Finder, you can Arrange By → Application Category:\n\nThis sorts your Applications folder by the category of the application.\n\nApplications without a category are listed under the Other section.\n\nA: This is a good place to use Labels. If you label each Application specifically, and then in Finder, sort by Label (Shift-Command-7), this will accomplish what you're trying to do essentially. \nYou can set Label names in the Finder preferences.\n\n", "Q: Fatal error after brew update interrupted While my system was performing a $ brew update && brew upgrade we had a power failure and my iMac shut down while updating packages/dependancies.\nAfter rebooting I tried to run $ brew update && brew upgrade again and encountered the following error:\n\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/': transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining\nError: Failure while executing: git pull -q origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\n\n$ brew doctor strangely returns a clean bill of health.\n\nA: Solved. The problem was running $ brew update && brew upgrade together.\nIt was causing some kind of Git formula conflict.\nI ran $ brew update and then $ brew upgrade, formulae were updated and all is good.\nAm now able to run both together again.\n", "Q: How do I take a screenshot and paste it in a file? I am trying to follow these instructions but not succeeding in what they are supposed to instruct.  Can somebody please shed light on how to do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*⌘ cmd + ⇧ shift + 3 will screenshot the entire screen and save it to your desktop. (You should hear a camera sound when you do this.)\n\n*⌘ cmd + ⇧ shift + 4 will give you crosshairs to use to select an area for copying. Move the crosshairs to the location that you want to copy and click the upper left, dragging the crosshairs to the lower right of the area you want. When you release, you will hear the same camera sound, and the screenshot will save to your desktop.\nAlso, ⌘ cmd + ⇧ shift + 4, then Space, then clicking any window will save that window to a screenshot.\nTo change the location of the saved screenshot, launch Terminal and use the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /path/ && killall -HUP SystemUIServer\n\nMake sure you change /path/ to be the location where you want your screenshots to go.\n\nA: If you take screenshots to the clipboard, you can paste them into the message and not deal with the intermediate file. \nUse ⌘ cmd control ⇧ shift 4 to go to clipboard. (Add control to the other shortcut.)\nNote that creating the file is more reliable than pasting for cross-platform messages.\n", "Q: Mac book charger Will using a 45w charger on my mac book pro 13 that came with a 60w charger cause operating problems? \nSine using a 45w charger my laptop cannot get past the grey/white loading screen? \n\nA: Using a lower powered AC adapter than the one that shipped with your Mac shouldn't cause the issue you're experiencing.\nTypically the only side effect to using the lower wattage adapter will be the inability to boot your Mac if it's battery is dead, since the lower wattage adapter doesn't provide enough power to power on the Mac without supplemental battery power.\nThe grey/white loading screen could be either a software issue or hardware issue.  To test this you can try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on your Mac while holding option, you should eventually reach a screen that shows any bootable volumes connected to the Mac as well as a wireless network drop down box.  If you see your hard drive listed here you can select it and click return to boot to it.\n\n*If your Mac still hangs at the white screen you can try holding the left shift key while powering it on, holding shiftuntil you reach the Apple logo with the spinning gear beneath it.  This should trigger safe boot, which runs a disk check during the boot process and disables third party extensions.  You may notice limited functionality when/if the Mac boots in Safe mode, see Apple's \"What is Safe Boot\" article for more info.\n\n*If both of these fail then you can try to boot to your recovery disk, assuming you have Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), and attempt to repair your Macintosh HD boot volume using Disk Utility.  To do so you will power on your Mac while holding option, just as in my first suggestion, but instead choose the Recovery volume if it's available.  Once booted to the Recovery disk you will choose Disk Utility, select your boot volume (Macintosh HD?) on the left and click \"Repair Disk\".  Once the repair is finished you can try rebooting.  If it fails let us know the error reported and we can offer further advice.\n\n\nIf all of the above fail and/or your hard drive doesn't show up in Disk Utility or as an option when booting with option held down then you are likely experiencing a hardware failure.\nHopefully that gives you a good starting point and/or resolution!\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 crashing constantly (Mountain Lion) I recently tried to send a video file that was too large via Outlook.

All the other projects within the same Git repository are fine and can be browsed with Finder.\n\nThis image should be displaying an Eclipse project folder, not what it is displaying currently. What's even more curious is that it shows a very old modified date. I have modified this project as of today August 27, 2013. The project runs and compiles fine, but is curiously messed up in Finder.  \nAs stated earlier, all other repo project folders appear to be fine. Am I using an illegal/reserved word? Please advise.\nThe folder is navigable via Terminal, just not in Finder.\nIt also appears to be from the usage of .service in the project folder name. Since Git will not allow me to rename, I am looking for a way to get around this in Finder.\nEdit\nI have been able to confirm that the name is causing the problem.  Now how to rename via git in Eclipse.\n\nA: First, you're right when you say that the problem comes from the .service extension of your folder.\nTo browse your project from Finder, you can right-click on the folder and click on \"Display Bundle Contents\", right under \"Open\".\n", "Q: iPhone 5 USB Audio I've been reading up on the Lightning cable, and there's been some debate over whether it transmits analog audio. I'm not sure how exactly the 30-pin connector works, or how the Lightning cable works (that electrical engineer stuff is over my head).\nI would like to know however if I am able to play audio into my car stereo from the iPhone 5. My car stereo, has a usb port that can connect to my iPhone via the 30-pin port. Does the iPhone 5 (with Lightning cable) have compatibility with these types of devices?\nEdit: For those interested, I'm not going to buy a 5; I'm due for an upgrade now, and I'll be getting the new iPhone whenever it's announced. I'd just like to know what the compatibility with my current setup will look like.\n\nA: If it works through the regular 30-pin to USB cable, it should work with the Lightning to USB cable as well.\nThis type of connection is through an all digital interface and I am not aware of any changes to it, when the lightning connector was introduced.\nIt's a different story, when you have a Y-Cable for your car. This would have a dock-connector on one side and a USB and Headphone-jack on the other.\nIn this case you will need a Lightning to 30-pin adapter. This would be an analog connection and the adapter would do the conversion from a digital into an analog signal.\n", "Q: Do any iPhone 5 docking stations offer both audio out and a lightning connector for charging? What iPhone 5 docking stations are on the market that provide an analog audio out connection similar to Apple's iPhone 4 dock?\nI currently use the above dock with my 4S for charging at night, but if I make an upgrade to the new iPhone, I'd like a Lightning dock.\nEDIT: I found one option on Amazon, but it appears to be low quality (some ship with Lightning port in the back, others with 30-pin port). I'm also concerned that plugging a 1/8\" jack into the headphone port will effectively silence my morning alarms.\n\nA: An OEM dock just popped up in store.apple.com after the 9/10 event: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MF030ZM/A/iphone-5s-dock\n\nA: From Apple's site is the Belkin dock for iPhone 5.\n\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro cannot connect to the Internet I last had my computer connected 3 days ago to a wireless network (the one I am still on with other computers). AirPort says it's connected and has a strong green light (full bars in wifi) but when I open System Preferences, the 902.1X: WPA: says FreeWiFi_Secure and the button says Connect, so I press that and under that it says \"Authentication server is not responding\" and has the waiting signal (spinning flower thing).\nThe wifi works as I am on it on my phone and no one else is having trouble in the house.\nCan someone please help this damsel in distress!\n", "Q: Unable to delete or archive mail Periodically, I keep getting an \"x messages could not be moved to the mailbox xxx.  An error occurred while moving messages to mailbox xxx\" popup (see below).  The only way I can resolve is to rebuild my entire mailbox, which takes a long time!  I am connected to an exchange server.  What is the likely cause of this issue?\n\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it successfully by rebuilding the mailbox (menu \"Mailbox\", then \"Rebuild\".\n\nA: The likely cause is network slowness when your Mail client is trying to move the messages on the server.\nIt's unlikely that your mailbox is so corrupt that you keep needing to rebuild and only the passage of time is significant in solving the issue.\nIf your computer hard drive were so unreliable that errors were creeping in with the same frequency that your Mail deletion happened, you would be noticing other corruption on other files.\n", "Q: TrueCrypt mount fails with cryptic error I am trying to mount a TrueCrypt file on my Mac (OS X 10.8).\nWhen I do so I get the following error:\n\nhdiutil: attach failed - no mountable file system\n\nThat is all there is. I tried running from the command line, but it switches to the GUI and then gives the same error.\n\n*\n\n*The password is correct. It gives a different error, if I mistype it.\n\n*The file is mountable and readable on Linux (Kubuntu 12.08 and 13.04)\n\n*I have two files were this happens (one is 470 Gb, the other is 300 Gb). One file where this is not the problem and at least reading works fine (haven't tested writing). That file is only 90 Gb.\n\n*The external disk where these files are on is formatted as ext4, which I mount through ext4fuse.\n\nPlease help me, I am in the process of copying the data onto a Mac compatible external disk. At the moment I am rsyncing over Wifi and it requires two computers running and takes ages.\nUPDATE\n\n*\n\n*Yesterday night, I copied the 300 Gb file to my Mac formatted external disk. The same problem happened, thus I'd conclude that it is not an ext4fuse issue.\n\n\n*The TrueCrypt volume is internally formatted as ext4.\n\n\n*It does not contain a hidden volume.\n\nA: Try mounting the volume as “read-only”:\nTrueCrypt → Preferences → Mount Options → Mount Volumes as read-only\n\nIf that doesn't do the trick then it's possible TrueCrypt could be having some issue with file system implementation mechanism (ext4fuse) not detecting that an ext4 volume is mounted. I've used FUSE for OS X with TrueCrypt and it works without any issues, so giving that a try instead of your current mechanism might help as well. \n\nA: In the end, I did not find a way to make this work under OS X. I copied the file to a Linux machine, mounted it and then scp'd everything to my OS X running machine. Reasonably simple but takes some time and one needs access to two machines. \n\nA: Try selecting \"Do not mount\" in VeryCrypt and then mount the disk manually. Open terminal:\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk5 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            VERACRYPT               +10.2 MB    disk5\n\ndiskutil mount /dev/disk5\nVolume VERACRYPT on /dev/disk5 mounted\n\nThere seems to be a problem with FAT32 and exFAT filesystems. After manually mounting the volume, I created a new with HFS+. I was able to mount it without any problems. I'm using Mac OSX High Sierra.\n\nA: I have been using a truecrypt container to hold the contents of my homedir and mounting it at every boot from a login hook. It worked like a charm, but due to the recent truecrypt oddities, I decided to switch to filevault. After the switch, I wanted to mount my truecrypt container (which contains a HFS+ filesystem) to copy over my data, and received the above error.\nAfter the initial break of sweat as I feared I lost all my data including a large part of my backups, I was able to resolve this by\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounting with truecrypt and the options --filesystem=NONE and (for safety) -m ro\n\n*With OSX Disk Utility, I was able to then simply mount the volume and copy over my stuff\n\n\nA: Please make sure the filesystem where the TrueCrypt volume is placed is not mounted read-only... \nSomehow I figured out that on MacOS you need a read-write filesystem even if you are only trying to mount it as read-only.\n\nA: The file you're trying to mount may have been made on a \"none\" file system.\n", "Q: OSX 10.8 - How to keep a custom dock for all users that login I have an iMac with OSX 10.8, joined to a work domain. I want to get create a custom dock and save it so all users will see my custom dock when they log in. I've done some Google searches and everything seems to point to these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create dock how you want it\n\n*Copy ~/library/preferences/com.apple.dock.plist to /system/library/user\\ template/english.lproj/library/preferences\n\n\nI've done this and then logged in as a new user, but am seeing a different dock than I created. I've also tried copying com.apple.dock.db to English.lproj/library/preferences as well, but to no avail.\nThe new users that will be logging in are network accounts.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: Dug up my notes from when I first modified the user template in our base images.  Ran back through the process, changing the default Dock to have about 15 items, on a fresh Mac and these steps worked.  I did a lot of this from the command line, so as to not fuss with changing/reverting permissions using Finder.\n\n*\n\n*Arrange your Dock however you would like for it to appear on new user accounts, changing the orientation and adding/removing applications.\n\n\n*Browse to ~/Library/Preferences and copy the com.apple.Dock.plist file to your desktop.\n\n\n*Open Terminal and start a root session by typing: sudo -s\n\n\n*Enter your current account's password when prompted\n\n\n*Copy the copy of your modified dock preference file from your desktop to the User Template in your Mac's System folder.: cp ~/Desktop/com.apple.Dock.plist System/Library/User\\ Template/English.lproj/Library/Preferences/\nThat should do the trick.  I tested this on a fresh Mac by logging into both a Guest account and a new (created after the above steps) standard user account, both accounts showed the proper Dock with 15~ items.\nIt shouldn't be necessary with these steps but if you run into trouble you should verify that the /System/Library/User Template folder has permissions set to: System - Read/Write & Everyone - No access.\n", "Q: If I buy a Mac that was shipped before Mavericks was released, will it have Mavericks preinstalled? What should I expect if I purchase a Mac soon after the new OS was released?\nI'm looking to know what will be pre-installed and how that might affect me as a consumer.\n\nA: Update: The info below is still valid for past practices but Apple yesterday released Mavericks and announced that it is free to download through the Mac App Store.  New Macs shipping today will still more than likely have Mavericks pre-installed, but if you do end up in a situation where a Mac you ordered a few days ago ships with Mountain Lion installed you can simply upgrade by installing Mavericks from the Mac App Store at no charge.\n\nIn the past Apple has included \"drop in\" upgrade DVDs with new Macs that shipped prior to the official release of the new OS.  This means that for a month or so after Snow Leopard was released you were likely to buy a new Mac that booted to Leopard but had a Snow Leopard disc tucked away in the box.\nOnce the new OS' went to a download only method Apple switched to an \"up to date\" program, where you could submit the Mac's serial number to a webpage and receive a redemption code to download the new OS from the Mac App Store.  The same time frame of \"about a month\" seemed to hold true with this last new release.\nObviously I can't say with 100% certainty that this will be the case with Mavericks but I would be surprised if any significant changes were made.\nThe up to date webpage is no longer active but this MacRumors article has a screenshot from when around the time it launched.\n\nSource - I worked at Apple, at an Apple Authorized Reseller and have received Macs in bulk for my current job, all at times when Apple launched new operating systems.\n\nA: Mavericks is free so just install from App Store\n", "Q: Apple ID change I changed my Apple ID to my new email address.  Now when I receive a text message, the box showing my old Apple ID and request for password appears.  Is there a way to make this stop happening?\n\nA: When the old password prompt is incorrect, you may need to sign out of the services using Apple ID one by one. \n\n\n*\n\n*Messages\n\n*FaceTime \n\n*App and iTunes stores\n\n*Find My Phone / Find My Friends\n\n*iCloud (do this last and only of needed)\n\n\nOnce the device signs out, your secure token and device ID should clear instantly, but consider waiting 15 minutes before signing back in. Use that time to sign in to http://appleid.apple.com to clear out any old addresses, credit cards, rescue emails, etc...\nAlso, I would sign out of any other computers or iOS devices that used that email on Messages. \nOnce I needed to contact Apple support to clear a account, but you could also just leave it signed out overnight and try after a longer stetch than 15 minutes as well. \n", "Q: Sharing screen with Messages.app on Mountain Lion Both computers are running OS X 10.8.4\nWhen trying to initiate the screen sharing feature, the other computer gets the request, then clicks \"Accept\" but thats as far as we get.\nThen we see this:\n\nI have posted the contents of the \"Details\" section:\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=yWYYCbgv\nI am thinking we may need to open some ports on the firewall. Anyone know which ports need to be open? Or if this is even the issue.\n\nA: Try opening up port 5222 (for iChat/Messages).\n", "Q: Do iTunes Connect sales chart show updates as well as new downloads? Just curious, does the sales chart in iTunes Connect combine the stats from updates and new downloads?\n\nA: The downloadable iTunes Connect sales and trend reports separate new sales and update downloads by separate line items with a different code for each type.  You can also select separate charts for new downloads or for updates in the app and on the web site.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to Wi-Fi (The Wi-Fi network \"network name\" requires a WPA2 password) I have had my MacBook Pro for a couple of months (recent Windows convert and total Mac novice). I am running OS X 10.8.4.\nOur cable company recently upgraded our modem and cable box and I am no longer able to connect to the Internet over Wi-Fi. \nI can connect via Ethernet. Also, two windows laptops, two iPhones and an iPad are all connected via Wi-Fi so I believe the wireless signal is working and can be connected to. \nI can see the network but when I enter the password the login box shakes like an incorrect password was entered. This is the same password I use for the other devices and I have carefully entered it many times so it should work.\nI would appreciate any thoughts you might have.\nThanks,\nJason\n\nA: I would recommend removing the wireless network from your preferred networks. You can do this by going to your network preferences. As follows: \nOpen Network Preferences > Select your Wi-Fi connection > Advanced. \n\nSelect the network from the list on the first Wi-Fi Tab and hit the [-] key then click OK. \n\nOnce you have done this, click Apply on the next screen. \nNext you want to remove the password from your keychain to make sure its gone. So open up Keychain Access Application. \nSearch for the wireless network name. Select the network name and hit delete key. Click the delete prompt to be sure. \n\nClose Keychain access and retry connecting to the wireless. This should have removed all traces of the wireless network from your computer and allow you to try it again. \n\nA: I had the same problem. I kept entering the WPA2 password CORRECTLY, and it was rejected each time.\nI went into Settings as above to change, and noticed that everything was grayed out. I then remembered that the account I'm usually logged into is not an administrator's account (for security reasons).\nSo I had to go back to the main Network pref pane, click the lock icon, and give my administrator login name and password.\nWithout doing anything else, I was now able to access the wifi network again and it took my password without any difficulty\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work with you, but my brother has the same issue. He uses a MacBook Pro 2010, while I have a MacBook Pro 2011. I can connect to my Wifi, yet he can't. Invalid password always comes up.\nAfter trying some ways, I found that I need to turn ON QoS setting on my Wi-Fi. And set it to WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) (if not available, I think just turn it ON). This setting is located on your Wi-Fi-router admin page, network tab, wireless section (Wi-Fi admin page usually just type on your browser 192.168.1.1 from connected device, with \"admin\" username and password).\nNow both of us can connect.\n\nA: I had to remove a custom \"location\" in network preferences. Once i did that, using \"automatic\" instead, everything started working again.\n\nA: .Hi Guys. I obviously was having the same trouble. What I did by chance was have my Macbook Pro El Capitan connected to my router with a serial cable and accessing the net and just removed the cable, and hey-ho it's working!\n\nA: I had the same issue with my 2006 MacBook 1181a after I upgraded the router in my apartment and installed an extender. I tried everything to no avail. Then I went into to admin page of my network and changed my password and it is working just fine now! Hopefully it will stay that way. I had only numbers as my passcode before, now i have numbers and letters. Maybe that had something to do with it? Good luck and I hope this helps!! \n\nA: Just fixed this problem for myself. One computer would not connect, even with the correct password. It would connect to a MiFi card, however. And every other device could connect to the router. So, they were both working, but not with each other.\nBoth the computer and router support 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. But it turns out the 5 GHz transmitter on the computer failed, but was still trying to connect at 5 GHz. My router was configured to use the same SSID and password for both configurations, so I changed the 5 GHz to use a different SSID. That forced the computer to connect at 2.4 GHz and everything started working again.\n", "Q: Does Safari's history store IP addresses?

Oversee your account balances, track investments, keep budgets, and manage your bank accounts, credit cards, loans, assets, and cash. Do it all in a straightforward and stylish interface.\n\n\nA: I manage my entire financial life in Quicken, including my chequing and savings accounts, employee stock plans (from both current and former employers), other individual stocks, 401(k) through my current employer, retirement plans, life insurance, mortgage, and credit cards.  I also have a budget that I track progress against.  I know that I'm an edge case in the amount of stuff that I actively track in a financial application.  \nI haven't found any of the Mac applications to meet my needs.  I've tried them all, repeatedly, and none of them are satisfactory for what I do.  It's usually the stock or the retirement plans where they simply can't do it.  As a result, I use Quicken for Windows.  It's the only reason that I use a virtualization application on my Macs at home.\n\nA: Chronicle\n\n\nEnter your bills in Chronicle, then forget them. You won’t need to wonder if you’ve paid a bill—Chronicle remembers for you. Why risk a late fee? Chronicle never forgets: it keeps track of all your bills, and reminds you when each one is due using Notification Center (Mountain Lion  required) and Calendar (optional), even when it isn’t running.\nWith multiple repeat options, all you have to do is set up your bill once. Each time you make and log a payment, Chronicle automatically updates the due date, and will remind you next time.\n\nNow, if all you care about is reminders for payments, and you aren't tracking a budget or a bank statement, Chronicle is perfect. I've used this since it was an alpha software, and I very much like its simple UI, notifications, and iOS/OS X syncing via DropBox.\n\nA: You might want to check out Microsoft Money and a Mac, a post I wrote in July of 2008 and frequently update, in which I detailed and reviewed about thirty different personal finance programs for the Mac and gave them all failing grades. (The article also includes over two hundred comments from other frustrated Mac users.)\nPlease don't flame me for posting a self-link; this is a topic about which I am very passionate and truly believe I am offering valuable input.\n\nA: Moneydance\n\n\nMoneydance is easy to use personal finance software that is loaded with all the features you need: online banking and bill payment, account management, budgeting and investment tracking.\n\nI've used Moneydance for many years, and it handles credit cards and bank accounts in multiple currencies quite well. The main app is written in Java, and has OS X, Windows, and Linux versions. The iPhone companion app is free, but requires the desktop app to work.\n\nA: I am a Mac user attached to elegance and esthetics as a significant factor in productivity for cognitive reasons. Personal finance is also for me particularly problematic because I hate doing it. I will find excuses to procrastinate. Therefore, the cognitive efficiency of the human interface is of paramount importance.\nFor transaction entry that means (for me) inline entry. Entry in a dialog or sheet is a major impediment. Entry in a side or top/bottom panel is a minor impediment (because when I conclude the entry, it is displayed far enough from where I entered the data to require a visual shift of context to make sure the entry was correctly accepted).\nAnother (secondary) criterion for me is an iOS version with synchronization, allowing at least the quick entry of a transaction when and where it is incurred.\nHaving pondered all that, and having tried many contenders, I would recommend two programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*MoneyWiz: excellent Mac native interface. Excellent overall feature set. Unfortunately, transaction entry is not inline, but in a popover window.\n\n*YNAB: even better feature set. The right approach to personal finance (IMHO), inline transaction entry. Big minus: written with Adobe Air, the Human Interface is not native, and gets infuriatingly in the way. I wrote extensively on their user forum about that, and  clearly, they are not sensitive to that at all.\nBoth have an iOS version. YNAB's is not full-featured.\nEventually, I chose YNAB. Inline entry is that important, and their approach is really good. I will continue now and then to push them on making it a native program, but I don't hold my breath.\n\nA: Let me put in a half-vote for SEE Finance. For my purposes the biggest missing item is Tags, promised in the next version which I'm afraid is far behind schedule. I've tried most of the other products listed in the other answers. Correct handling of investments, decent UI (especially category assignment), and tags seems to be a hard triple to find.\n\nA: I finally found the solution to the Quicken on Mac problem. I downloaded Oracle Virtual Box, a free tool that allows me to run Windows on my Mac. (Windows becomes a separate running application, that you can tab to).\nThen I installed Quicken.

Airs and other SSD based Macs generally have plenty of horsepower to deal with thousands of messages a second let alone per minute and the system logging infrastructure scales very well, uses little RAM and is miserly with CPU and disk access.\n\nNow, as far as hunting down the culprit - it's going to be a bit of sleuthing unless someone has already slayed this bug by noticing why the space got added in that directory for the app.\nI would probably edit the plist file for that process to set the respawn to be 100 or 300 or 600 until you have a handle on the error (and if you don't want to see so many messages).

So I tried splitting my library into smaller ones per year, however that won't speed up the process.\nWhat can I do to actually speed up the process?\n\nA: You could speed things up by connecting the iMac to a newer Mac in target disk mode (connected over Firewire) and then try the copy letting the new Mac do the faster copy.\nHowever, the estimate might be over inflated and once you get over copying the small files, the actual transfer might only take 5 to 8 hours even if the Mac is running mostly idle.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=time+to+transfer+145+GB+at+a+data+rate+of+10+megabytes+per+sec\nWhile the transfer is running, you can see both the instantaneous transfer rate in terms of data rate and IO rate.

No third-party software like apps are installed --- the device is all but fresh from the factory. \nThe device gets non-responsive sometimes when I get an incoming call (about one call in 20) -- the phone keeps ringing but it's impossible to answer it because the touch screen won't respond. After clicking the lock button (on top of the device) a few times, the call is lost and the device gets back to normal, which makes me think this is an iOS bug and not a hardware problem. \nIs there any workaround for this problem?\nEdit: After using the phone more, I've noticed that the UI may suffer hiccups in many more situations (for instance when texting somebody a message); the phone freezes and becomes unresponsive for a few seconds. This behavior is obviously most annoying when you can't answer incoming calls.\n\nA: I couldn't ring out or accept incoming calls on new Iphone 5 as it had become unresponsive, there are very few apps installed on phone as it is new. Turned power off and back on and phone works again. Hope problem is not recurring.  \n\nA: Restarting and resetting the phone seems to have solved the problems. It now works like a charm.

Is it possible to boot iMac from external USB CD-ROM?\n\nA: I can't say for certain that booting from a USB optical drive wouldn't work but I would be surprised if it did.  PowerPC (G3, G4, G5) Macs only natively supported booting from Firewire devices.\nWith that said, there are old tricks to making a PowerPC based Mac boot from a USB2 hard drive.  I've never tested it with a USB optical drive but you might give it a shot none the less.  The text below is copied from the excellent tip at Mac OS X Hints...  This may work for your needs but I would strongly urge you to proceed with caution as it involves making alterations to Open Firmware.\n\nFirst off, I have tried and tried again over the years to boot various PowerPC Macs via a USB2 disk. Thankfully, somewhere about the time the iMac G5 with the ambient light sensor (ALS) was released, Apple tweaked their Open Firmware, which allowed us to boot PowerPC Macs from USB2 drives. \nMachines that I have tested this hint on and made it work are:\niMac G5 w/ ALS\niMac G5 w/iSight (thanks to the eager user who emailed me)\n12\" PowerBook 1.3GHz\nWithout further delay, here's the process to follow. \nNote: As with all hints that have to do with Open Firmware, proceed at your own risk! I have not experienced a problem and I don't see how this hint could render your Mac useless, since the default can always be recovered by resetting the SMU. \nHere's what you need to do...\n  You need a USB2 drive with an OS X system installed (I am using 10.4.3, though any I think will work as far as what the machine can boot). As you know, there are many different ways of getting a system on a USB drive; contact me if you have any questions on how to do that, or search macosxhints.com for that information.\nConnect the drive to your machine, and find out which partition the OS X system is installed on. I usually find this by going to Disk Utility and looking at the info for the partition on the USB disk with OS X. That is, disk2s3 is usually for a USB disk with no OS 9 drivers installed that is the second disk disk. disk3s9 might be a USB disk with OS 9 drivers that is considered the third disk. There are other ways of finding this out, but in my case, my disk is disk2s3 (the 3 on the end will come into play soon).\nStart up the machine in Open Firmware (this is the fun part). Hold CommandOptionOF right after the machine is turned on.\nHere is the moment of truth. If this step does not work, I have had very limited success getting a machine to boot off USB2. In Open Firmware, type devalias, and you should get a list as output. In this list, look for ud, usually below where you see hd (ud is \"USB Disk,\" I presume). If found, it will usually have beside it /pci@f2000000/usb@1/disk1, or something similar. Again, if you see this, I have not had this fail yet.\nNow type printenv boot-device, which will usually get you output of boot-device hd:,\\:tbxi. (See where this is going yet?)\nType setenv boot-device ud:3,\\:tbxi where the number after the colon corresponds to that partition number we found in step two. You should get an ok back.\nType printenv boot-device, and you should see the change displayed already. Something like:\n  boot-device   ____     ud:3,\\:tbxi   ____     hd:,\\:tbxi\"\nType mac-boot and cross your fingers.\nAnd now some more fun, there is a Unix script that can be written to enable this, because after all we are only changing a nvram variable. The command would be similar to this:\nnvram boot-device ud:3,\\\\:tbxi\nNow this looks a tad bit different then what we typed in Open Firmware, but that's because we have to escape the two backslashes, each with a backslash of its own. \nIf this fails, there is a remote possibility that you can still boot off of USB2, but you may need to substitute ud for /pci@f2000000/usb@1/disk1, or something similar. If the firmware cannot list the contents of the drive, it seems it cannot boot off of it. \nAs you should know (thanks to the owner of the iMac G5 w/iSight for letting me know I should mention this), USB2 booting is not supported, therefore you should remember OS X has no support for booting USB 2 and the firmware has no support. So in System Preferences, the USB disk will not be shown as a bootable drive. In the optional boot menu (reached by holding down Option during boot), it also will not show. \nSo the two ways that I know how to enable it are through terminal by using the nvram command, and directly in Open Firmware. Hope this hint helps someone out there. I figured my trick was shot as soon as the Duo Core machines came out, but I now realize there are quite a few people with PPC Macs that might be able to use this hint.\n\n", "Q: Name resolution is using proxy server over my local DNS server I'm running a local DNS server to resolve .dev as a testing domain on my machine, the resolution works fine and shows the proper answer through dig and ping and I can pull the home page instantly with curl.\nThe DNS server is my only configured name server in System Preferences acting as a forwarder to the corporate DNS servers.\nHowever, in the browser the domain does not resolve properly. This appears to be because of my corporate proxy server, which is somehow taking priority in resolving over the local dns server.

How can I change the resolution order so that the proxy is second to my local DNS server?\n\nA: It seems as though setting the search domains explicitly to be:\n*.dev\ncorporate.com\n\nIn System Preferences fixes the problem.

Wouldn't it be cool, if you could somehow use the desktop software running on your Mac on your iPad !!!\nIs this possible ?\n\nA: Using remote desktop tools, yes.\nFor example, Remoter VNC, LogMeIn, and Teamviewer come to mind immediately.\n\nA: Parallels Access, a new iPad App from Parallels makes it easier to use desktop software on your Apple iPad tablet. With one part remote access and one part native iPad app, you get a desktop experience on a tablet that almost feels like you are using the software just like it was on your Mac.\nFor more info see the link above and also read this review published in The Mac Observer yesterday.\nAdditionally see this introductory video.\nIt is a premium product $80 per year, however a 14 day free trial is available (Windows/OS X/iPad Compatible).\n\nA: As other users suggested, this may be possible using other \"middleman\" software.\nHowever, all (relatively new) Macs have Intel CPUs and all iOS iPhone/Pod/Pads have ARM processors. The compiled binary files are simply not compatible.\nRemember that, although they share components, these are fundamentally different OSs. OS X  (mostly) uses the AppKit Framework for UI, and iOS uses the UIKit Framework. Although these APIs are very similar, they are not interchangeable.\nSo, even if there was a way to trick your iOS device into accepting a *.app file, it would never launch (or crash immediately upon launching) without fundamental changes to the hardware and software architecture of iOS and its devices.\n\nA: There are several dozen VNC and RDP apps in the iOS App Store (and yes, there seem to be at least 2 vendors of RDP servers for the Mac), as well as another few that use custom remote display viewing protocols, that allow one to use software running on your Mac on your desk from an iPad while sitting on your couch (etc.). \nMany of these apps have been available since before the first iPad was announced, and run on the iPhone as well.\n", "Q: Web development on PowerPC I'm interested in LAMP stack and Nodejs stack for PowerPC (iMac g5).

There is no problem with the wifi because my family doesn't face any such problems on their laptops. I tried refreshing network preferences but didn't work.

I don't have the same luxury with Snow Leopard, although I guess I could virtualize an instance of it, and run it on the desktop side as well.\n\nA: You cannot install 10.7 server on a 10.8 client. \nYou will need to purchase 10.8 server to install it on your 10.8 client. \n\nA: You might try redownloading it from the Mac App store - Server\nSince the version of Server changed between 10.7 & 10.8 you won't be able to install it using the same package as you did for the server but if you can redownload it from the Mac App store I believe you should be able to connect it to your 10.7 server.  I'm currently running 10.8 server on our Mac Pro server and using Server beta on my 10.9 MacBook Air to administer it.  It seems like I was in a setup similar to yours this time last year.\nOnce you launch the Server app you can connect to the 10.7 server by choosing \"Other Mac\" from the main window (see attached image), enter the server address/name along with your server admin credentials.\n\nHopefully this works for you!\n", "Q: Once you remove an app from iOS notification center, can you add it back? I exited out of my snapchat notifications in the notification center (I clicked the \"x\" on the right hand side) and now I can't see anything and I want to get it back.\nI don't know what to do.\n\nA: Nope you can't get it back once you dismissed the notification. \n\nA: I did this to a couple apps, and then realised my mistake. So far, I have only been able to restore the application to the notification screen by completely removing it and all its configurations (through General > Usage > app name), but that is far from ideal.\nI'm very interested in a better solution.\n", "Q: iPod touch notification center I exited out of a couple apps while I was in my notification center on my iPod touch.

I want to add a smart folder for each label in the sidebar (I believe there is no way to directly to add the labels, so I have to resort to smart folder). However, all of them have the gear icon in the sidebar, even if I changed its icon and the icon is correctly shown in finder itself.\nNote that I am NOT changing the smart folder's default icon, I just want to change them to a red, green, blue ... dots, just like the labels.\nHow can I achieve this?\nMore info:\nChanging the icon itself does not affect sidebar look.

You can't (unless there's a third party tool about which I am unfamiliar). However, you can change the default icons to your heart's content. Here's how:\nAs a test, I created a Smart Folder that finds all PDFs in my home directory. The default glyph for the Smart Folder is a gear, as noted in the OP.\nHere are the steps to change the glyph:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the directory /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources\n\n*Locate the file called SidebarSmartFolder.icns\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Rename it to SidebarSmartFolder_old.icns\n\n*Paste into Resources folder the glyph you want to use in its place.\n\n*Rename it to SidebarSmartFolder.icns\n\n*Reboot your Mac.\n\n\nYou'll see now that my Smart Folder glyph in the sidebar has changed to the new one.\n\n\nA: You can create your smart folder and then change its icon in the same way you can with any other icon on OSX:\n1) Copy any image or icon and copy it to the clipboard (Cmd+C)\n2) Select your smart folder and press Cmd+I to show its information window\n3) Click on the icon on the top left\n4) Press Cmd+V to paste the image/icon from your clipboard\n\nI just tried it and works : )\nUpdate: I am using OS X Mountain Lion\n", "Q: Scaling text in Keynote I have a complex drawing in Keynote, which I need to resize. I can do this by making the drawing into a group, but unfortunately it contains many text labels, which do not resize when I change the size of the group. I can change the font size, but it's quite hard to get the new font size to look the same as the old one. What usually happens is that the new text is slightly larger than the text boxes, so I end up having to manually resize each one in order to make it readable again.\nUsually I get around this by taking a screenshot and inserting it into the presentation as an image. However, in this case I need the image to have a transparent background. I tried using Keynote's Instant Alpha feature, but it left white in the interiors of letters like \"O\" and \"a\", and manually removing that is just as much work as manually resizing all the text boxes.\nSo is there some kind of method or workaround for resizing the text of a keynote drawing along with the other elements, while keeping the background transparent?\n\nA: In Keynote.app: Select all parts of the graphic you need to scale, then copy them to the clipboard (Command-C).\nIn Preview.app, just create a new document (Command-N). Contents from the clipboard will be automatically inserted. Save this document as PDF somewhere, and drag it to Keynote. This should do the trick.\n\nA: My solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*duplicate the slideshow, \n\n*resize the entire document (Document tab of the 'properties sidebar' > Slide Size dropdown)\n\n*copy the correctly sized elements back to the original doc.\n\n\nAny variation of this will probably work - the key principle is that if you resize from the Arrange properties tab, objects will resize whilst text won't; if you resize the document: everything stays in proportion.\nUsing the accepted answer's method, I wasn't able to edit the content I'd pasted from preview (the pdf contains a rasterized png, I believe).\n", "Q: Switch from a not-installed Windows partition to Mountain Lion I tried to install Windows in dual boots (version 4 I think) in my Macbook Pro 10.8. Everything was fine until Windows boot for the first time for it's installation. The operating system was not able to find Windows related drivers on the usb key I used with Bootcamp. So, my mistake was to shutdown and try again, but now Windows can't find my bootable device anymore.\nThe real problem is that I'm stuck on Windows' booting partition and can't go back to OS X. I tried several times Command+R or pressing T or Option during booting but everytime I face a lock icon with a password field. The password field doesn't recognize my administrator password and I never activated the root user. For testing I tried differents password that could be default one such as 'root' or 'admin' or 'sudo' but none of them actually works. If I can get passed this step, I can actually follow other tutorials.\nIn brief, is there a way I can switch back to OS X partition without using option key or is there a password for this locked screen?\nI wish that I was enough clear to be answered by someone.\n\nA: That password I think is EFI password.\nTo reset your EFI firmware password, hold Command and R keys while your Mac is starting to start in Recovery HD. Then, go to the Utilities menu, open Firmware Password Utility and disable the EFI firmware password.\nIf you don't remember the EFI password, take your computer to an Apple Store\nIf you don't have any Apple Store nearby, look up here, maybe you will find something good for your situation: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=reset+efi+password+macbook&oq=reset+efi+password+macbook&gs_l=youtube.3...197.5674.0.5891.22.16.0.6.6.0.353.2286.7j5j3j1.16.0.eytns%2Cpt%3D-27%2Cn%3D2%2Cui%3Dt..0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.1_D0FcEVNL0\nP.S. you can try to remove the battery for a couple of minutes, sometimes it helps: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n", "Q: My Apple E-mail is incorrect I tried going to the AppStore and iTunes, etc. and it said that I have the incorrect Apple email (for the Apple ID) and I tried changing it to my actual email but it pops up as a different email.\nIs there anything that I can do to reset it to my actual email?\n\nA: In iTunes...\nTap Featured at the bottom of the screen.\nScroll to the bottom and tap the account name then Sign out.\nTap Sign in and use the account you want.\nThen tap Updates.\nsource: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3078909?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove or delete the \"Music\" folder? Is there anyway to get Music out of my way in my home directory?  Either deleting it, or moving it to someplace else.\nNow, I know that this question has been asked before (I've read this one and this one too), so I know that some more details are needed or I'll get back bogus answers...  So: what I want is to rename or remove the actual folder, hopefully with any magical stuff that the OS is doing with it (like scanning it for changes, or worse: add meta-data files).\nSymbolic links are unrelated here, since I want to move the actual directory to a place I don't really care about, I don't want to create some other name for it.  I also don't care what's visible in the Finder -- so flipping some hidden bit that makes it not show up there won't do me any good.  This is making it a very different issue from the ones in those other questions.\n(The complete story is that I have recently started using a Mac, and I need to wire it into the network of file syncing that I do across many machines (using unison).  Naturally, I have music in a music directory, which collides with OSX's Music thing, so I need to get it out of my way.  That's why I don't care how it's shown in the Finder or if I'm losing some marvelous iTunes features.  (I will most likely not even notice it if both Finder and iTunes disappear from this machine.))\n\nA: Do you have any indication that the OS will mind if you just rm -rf Music?\nAs far as I know, iTunes is the only app that uses that directory (at least on my machine, there seems to be nothing else in it).\nSo if you don't ever launch iTunes again, that directory should never reappear. If you want to guard against accidentally opening iTunes, you can move its library to a different location before removing the directory.\n\nA: It won't work. The system keeps re-creating a Music folder in the Home directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you run them, then yes, iTunes and many other applications use the ~/Music directory.\n\n*Moving the iTunes Media folder won't get you out from under that. iTunes creates many other items in the ~/Music directory in addition to the Media folder, and those other items will not get moved from ~/Music when the Media folder does. And given the chance, (i.e., running it), iTunes will create those items, re-create them after you remove them, and re-create them again and again.\n\n*As far as I can tell, and I've worked pretty hard on it, you're stuck with something called \"Music\" or \"music\" going to be in your Home directory. I say \"something\", because it can also be a file. It doesn't sound like this approach is a viable solution for you, but it may be for others with almost exactly the same requirements (but not exactly the same). It worked for me. Though not a solution, hopefully the preceding information is informative. I believe it to be incontrovertible.\n\n*After deleting the offending folder, I created two empty, zero byte files and saved them in the Home directory. I named one \"music\" and the other \".music\" with no file extension in either case. Their presence blocks the system from creating a folder in that location with the name \"Music\". I set the immutable flag (chflags uchg ~/music) on both, I manually hid the visible one, and I roundly revoked the \"write\" permission from each. One would think that would do the trick, but when the system cannot save its folder there because it cannot over-write the files, it tries to change the permissions back and restore its power to write. To overcome this I made root the owner of the two files. That about did it. No more Music folder.\nNote to Editor: Please do not alter the syntax of \"something called 'Music' or 'music' going to be in your Home directory\" above. It may sound awkward, but it is extremely precisely worded. I'd rather not post at all if the phrase is not allowed to stand ver batim. Thanks.\n\nA: I do not know about the other answers, but checking the ACL (ls -le) gave me this:\n0: group:everyone deny delete\n\nso I chmod -N'd (or chmod -a# 0) the folders to remove the ACL and I successfully deleted Music like a piece of cake.\nI have deleted Downloads, Music, Movies, Desktop (maybe also Documents), Public using this method, but I have not been able to delete Pictures for some reason.\nAlso, if you would like to also make your files \"undeletable\", just add the ACL:\nchmod +a 'group:everyone deny delete'\n\n\nA: If you just want to hide it from Finder, open your Console and execute the following command line in your Home directory:\nchflags hidden ./Music \nThe directory is still there, however, Finder will not display it as it is marked hidden. \nIf you change your mind, then: \nchflags nohidden ./Music\nFor complete chflags documentation, type:\nman chflags.\n\nA: From: Remove Movies Home folder at Official Apple Support Communities\n\nIt is set to not delete because it may be expected by some programs.\n  If you really think it is necessary to delete the folder, you could\n  remove it in the Terminal with\nsudo rm -r ~/Movies\n\nBe careful and good luck. If you mess up typing the command you could\n  delete something you didn't want to. sudo will ask for your password,\n  but won't actually show anything on screen when you type it. rm is\n  remove and -r tells it to work through any subfolders. ~/ is your home\n  directory.\n\n", "Q: How do I find links for iTunes U Videos to download using the 'resume' feature in curl I have a flaky internet connection and I was trying to download some course videos on iTunes U. Three attempts to download 800 MB files failed because the connection was reset. So I'm now trying to find a way to use curl and its -C - option to download the videos with the ability to resume.\nBut I struggled to find an effective way to get the link from which iTunes downloads the videos. There might be CDN's hosting the content and the URL's will change over time. But how do I find out which link curl must download the video files from right now?\nThese are free videos and I don't think there's authentication involved. Even if that were the case, there should be some way to get the relevant cookies and use them with curl.\nUpdate: I found a link to the RSS feed in this case and I picked up the link to the relevant mp4 files. But in general, how do I get to the rss feeds for iTunes U courses?\n\nA: It turned out to be pretty simple in the end. I just had to grab the source of the rss feed that instructed my browser to switch to iTunes. Once I download the rss feed using a tool like curl, this one for example, it's a matter of scraping the links to the mp4 files and downloading them with curl.\n", "Q: Macbook Air (Mid 2013) keyboard and trackpad not detected I was holding down a key (can't remember which) and then my keyboard and trackpad were no longer responsive.

It can however detect external keyboard and mouses. I have Googled endlessly for hours.\nAnyone else experience this issue or have any suggestions? \nI am desperate. I will travel to Alaska and hit option 5 times at this point.\n\nA: This sounds like the kext that controls the built in keyboard / mouse is either missing or damaged.  I believe the kext in question is something along the lines of \"IOUSBFamily.kext\". I doubt this would be a hardware/firmware issue though since Windows recognizes input from the built in keyboard/trackpad.\nYou might try repairing the disk using Disk Utility in the recovery volume and then repairing permissions using Disk Utility while booted to your Macintosh HD volume.\nIf those don't resolve the issue then I would attempt an archive & install of the OS...\n\n\n*\n\n*To boot to the recovery partition you need to power it off\n\n*\n\n*On start up, using the USB keyboard, press command + r or if that doesn't work press option until you see your partitions, then select recovery 10.x\n\n\n*Wait for the recovery tool to boot\n\n*Select \"Reinstall OS X\"\n\n*Follow the on screen prompts to reinstall OS X\n\n\nThis process SHOULD preserve your data but as always it's a good idea to have a backup of any pertinent data beforehand.  The reinstallation will go through and reinstall the base system files, which should include the missing/damage kext responsible for the problem, while leaving any files you've added  alone.\nHopefully all goes smoothly and that fixes it for you!\n\nA: People are yelling thanks for this solution:\nhttps://lbarclay.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/macbook-pro-trakpad-and-keyboard-not-working/\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Hibernates Straight Away Whenever my Mac goes to sleep when its on battery, it straight away saves its contents to the hard drive and powers off, going into a deep sleep.\nThis gets really annoying when I walk away for 10 minutes to make a coffee for example and come back to have to wait up to a minute (depending on what I'm running) for the laptop to wake up. This only happens when its on battery though.\nI have tried an SMC and cleared the PRAM/NVRAM but it hasn't seemed to work.\nAdmittedly the other day I was using a terminal command to disable hibernation when plugged into a power supply and must have mucked it up then. I don't seem to remember the command that I used and therefore can't use it to reverse it.\nBut yeah would there be a way to stop my laptop from hibernating the second it goes to sleep on battery power?\n\nA: The default hibernatemode on Apple laptops is 3 which does the following:\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.\nSo, to have instant wake from sleep change the hibernatemode to 0 which does the following:\nhibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\nTo see what your current hibernatemode is set to, run the following command:\npmset -g | grep hibernatemode\nTo change the hibernatemode for instant wake from sleep, run the following command:\npmset hibernatemode 0\n\nA: Possibly you tried this already, but going into system preferences and making sure the hibernation time is a useful number like 30 minutes? And restarting to make sure it's \"set\". \n", "Q: Markdown editor with edit and view mode I'm looking for a OS X markdown (or similar) editor that has an edit and a view mode.

I could not find a native way to retain embedded hyperlinks when saving to a PDF from Excel 2011.  However, there are a number of workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have Numbers (the Apple equivalent of Excel) you can upload your xls file and then save as a PDF from there.\n\n*If you don't have Numbers, you can use an online conversion tool such as: http://www.zamzar.com/\n", "Q: Hear ambient sound while listening to music with headphones on OSX I don't want people to yell at me when they want to say something while I'm using headphones on my desktop computer.\nI'm thinking an app could just listen to the ambient sound and lower the volume when it is loud. Apparently, Awareness does something like this on iOS.

It would be far preferable for it to default to the location of the .docx file I'm working with. Is there a way to achieve this result?\n\nA: The save as PDF option in the Print window is controlled by the system, not Word. It will default to the last place you saved a PDF because that's all it knows about. It is completely separate from (and unaware of) the Open and Save dialog boxes. That said, you can save a Word document as a PDF from File > Save As, and that will respect your last working directory related to the docx file.\n", "Q: Wifi channel selection Is it possible specifically select a Wifi channel use? I am defaulting to channel 6 which has a low signal to noise ratio.  \"Wifi Signal\", ver 1.3 suggests that several other channels offer better qualities.

Your computer when it isn't connected essentialy listens on 1, then 2, then 3, then 4... \nIt creates a list of all the ones it finds, then presents the list to you.\nSome WAP's also can be configured to set a particular channel.  In addition you may be able to change the default power setting.\nMy experience has been that WAP location and antenna orientation have far more to do with SNR than channel number.  If this is a home network, you may want to look at putting a WAP at opposite ends of your house.  If you do this, only ONE of them serves DHCP requests.  Or both serve to a central computer.  Or you set all local addresses manually.  2 DHCP servers is a pile of grief.\nTo formally answer your question:  At the client end, no it is not possible.  At the WAP yes it is possible.  \nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to get Open File selector to show hidden files? I would like my Open File selector to be showing hidden files.

(shift-command-.) to show hidden files in a file dialog temporarily.\nTo make Sublime Text show hidden files by default, run:\ndefaults write com.sublimetext.2 AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\n\nTo show hidden files in all applications but not in Finder, run:\ndefaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false\n\nYou can apply the changes by quitting and reopening applications. AppleShowAllFiles also affects other views besides file dialogs.\n", "Q: Fresh Lion install on a MacBook Air (Late 2010) without Recovery Key As the title says, I have an MacBook Air (Late 2010 - MC505LL/A*), with preinstalled OSX Lion. Also it shipped with an USB key called \"Recovery Key\", and afaik, I'm supposed to use this key if I restore/format my Mac\nThe problem is that I can't find the USB key, and I'd like to know if I can do a fresh install of Lion without it.

I can use osascript or even just open to open the AS App, but that will run its on run handler, not the on open droplet handler I need to be run. I tried passing the \"dropped\" file in (osascript /Path/To/App.app /Path/To/Droppings.txt), but it still runs the on run handler. Is there a way to do this? And if not with bash, is it possible from another AppleScript? Thanks.\n\nA: You can use another AppleScript that tells Finder to open files with the droplet application.\nFor example save this script as /Applications/droplet.app in AppleScript Editor:\non open a\n    repeat with f in a\n        say POSIX path of f\n    end repeat\nend open\n\nThen run:\nosascript -e 'on run {f}' -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to open POSIX file f as alias using POSIX file \"/Applications/droplet.app\"' -e end /bin/test\nTo open multiple files, convert the list of arguments to a list of file objects:\nosascript -e 'on run a\nset l to {}\nrepeat with f in a\nset l to l & POSIX file f\nend\ntell app \"Finder\" to open l using (POSIX file \"/Applications/droplet.app\")\nend' ~/*\n\nAlternatively, create the droplet application with Automator instead of AppleScript Editor:\n\nThen run open -a droplet2 /bin/test.\nThe run handler is also used for files dropped on the application.

Summary\nUnable to boot into the OS X partition of a 2013 MBA which dual-boots OS X and Windows 8 via BootCamp. Could \"Repairing Disk\" via \"Disk Utility\" damage the working Windows 8 partition? What other utilities/actions should I try?\nDetail\nI have a 2013 MBA that was setup by the Ops department in a company I did some work for to dual-boot OS X (for me) and BitLocker-encrypted Windows 8 (for work on their codebase) via BootCamp. They had to wipe the OS X Recovery partition to achieve this. At some stage the OS X partition was working fine (I'm assured), but I'm only able to boot into Windows 8 now. To complicate matters my access to the account on the Windows partition is now disabled (so I can't do further diagnostics through it), but that's another story. The Ops department have had a look but it's beyond their experience with BootCamp.\n\n\n*\n\n*On pressing Alt/Option on startup I can get into the BootCamp Boot selector; it lists only \"Windows\"\n\n*From within Windows 8, when I choose the BootCamp \"Boot to OS X\" option, it just starts up in Windows 8 again.\n\n*From within Windows 8, the BootCamp control panel lists two \"Windows\" related startup options, both of which appear to boot to the same \n\n*From within Windows 8 I could confirm there were 2 accessible disk partitions of approx equal size, one looked (to a cursory examination) to have the filesystem structure I'd expect from a Unix, from which I extrapolate that the files of the OS X partition are still in place and undamaged.\n\n*When I run Internet Recovery, Disk Utility lists 5 partitions. It is unable to mount any of them. disk0s2 and disk0s4 must be the Windows and OS X partitions as they are almost 50% of the total volume each (the others are all ~ 100MB), but both show up as MS-DOS (FAT), whereas presumably one should be a Mac OS Extended format? I tried to \"verify\" the first three, all got as far as \"Checking file system\" and then failed \"Error: This disk needs to be repaired. Click Repair Disk\", some with extra info:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk0s2 Format: MS-DOS (FAT):\n** /dev/disk0s2\nInvalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block 000000\n\n\n*disk0s3 Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled): [No extra explanation]\n\n*disk0s4 Format: MS-DOS (FAT): \n** /dev/disk0s4\nInvalid signature in fsinfo block\nfix? no\n** Phase 1 - Preparing FAT\nFAT[0] is incorrect (is 0xD9058EB; should be 0xFFFFFF8)\nCorrect? no\nFAT[1] is incorrect\nCorrect? no\n** Phase 2 - Checking Directories\nRoot directory starts with cluster out of range(0)\n\n\n*disk0s5 Partition Type: DE94BBA4-...

(corresponds to Windows Recovery Environment): unavailable for verification\n\n\n\nMy questions are\n\n\n*\n\n*Could running \"Repair Disk\" damage the working Windows partition?\n\n*Does this sound like a common problem that can be easily fixed by doing X (my google-fu drew a blank)?\n\n*What other utilities/actions should I try that definitely won't damage the working Windows 8 partition?\n\n\nA: I managed to run more diagnostics against the disks from the Windows side. From the BitLocker password screen, choose something like \"Esc\", \"Esc\", \"Skip this drive\", \"Advanced\", \"Utilities\", \"Command-line\" (please correct), then use manage-bde -unlock to unlock the BitLocker drive, and use various wmic commands to examine the disk partitions. Through this I confirmed:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk0s2 is my OS X partition. There are some tools which can change Guids in the GPT; it seems this is what happened to my OS X partition. This explains why OS X doesn't recognize it, but when booted into Windows I could access the data in it no problem.\n\n*disk0s4 is my Windows partition. To the best of my knowledge, the Invalid signature in fsinfo block errors I was getting are due to it being fully BitLockered which means the encrypted bits on disk don't look like a valid partition. Windows can apparently recognize the signature and warn you on trying to read from a locked BitLocker partition.\n\n\nThese are all the possible solutions I came across (largely through Apple's very helpful Tech Support), including the things that didn't work for me and why:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your existing partitions as images to an external drive via the \"New Image\" option in Disk Utility. I do have a 1TB backup drive, but it's NTFS formatted and apparently OS X can't write to NTFS disks by default (try this to enable NTFS write access on a standard OS X installation - but it doesn't work in Internet Recovery as the terminal gives you access to a read-only file-system only).\n\n*Backup your existing partitions as images to an external drive via [name of Windows program here]. I couldn't find any built-in Windows utilities capable of this, and due to my Windows login being disabled I couldn't access a full Windows environment to run any proper backup tools. I tried running them from the BitLocker command-line but I couldn't get any of them to work, I assume because the environment is heavily cut-down (and most of them insist on \"installing\" rather than just \"running\").\n\n*Backup your existing files by transferring them to another Mac via Target Disk Mode - I have no second Mac on hand to make this work.\n\n*Just run Repair Disk - it is reportedly very unlikely to damage anything. When I tried this it just said it couldn't repair the disk - possibly because the BitLocker partition doesn't look like a valid partition (see above). A bit of an anticlimax after agonizing over the decision for days...\n\n*If you have the Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block 000000 error, someone wrote a utility which can reportedly fix the GPT up again. I couldn't use it because I couldn't find a way to install all it's dependencies (e.g. Python...) in the Internet Recovery read-only file-system.\n\n*Just erase some/all partitions and start again - in the end I decided to take the plunge and erase the existing corrupted OS X partition, leaving the rest untouched (once I'd made myself relatively certain which one was OS X). Disk Utility makes it very straightforward to erase a single partition and install OS X on it.\n\n\nErasing the OS X partition and re-installing has now resulted in me being able to dual-boot OS X and Windows 8 via BaseCamp as desired. Next time I'm in Windows I'll have to check whether I do indeed have \"MacDrive\" installed, and remove it if I do.\n\nA: if only you could remove the drive an just attach it to another windows8 machine, where if the drive is recognised and accessible, bitlocker should prompt you to authenticate.\nif you have a virtualised instance of the disk, maybe you could attach the flat file to another windows 8 guest and see if the drive is recognised...\n(:\noption 2 (bit of a longer shot)\nreinstall osx on the previous osx partition.

However the stars are not filled. Anyone no why? Here is a pic:\n\n\nA: I haven't seen it documented anywhere, but my impression is that only apps with a large number of reviews get colored in stars.\nThe app in question still has no reviews that have aged in long enough (or numbers enough) to get a summary yet. My guess is that after a certain number of reviews (around 100 by my experience) an application will get a summary update on the store. Also, there is probably a timer (maybe 30 days) when the ratings will get solidified and drawn in solidly.\nIn this case, it looks like you'll want to wait until 20 to 50 reviews are added and three weeks have passed and then see if the ratings are updated as you expect.\nAnother possibility is that the reviewers gave you zero stars and good words which seems less likely, but possible as well.\n", "Q: Trying to copy files and preserve ownership First I tried cp -Rp to preserve ownership of copies files.

I have an Apple Mail smart mailbox set up to filter out all of the messages that contain a certain string in the subject line.\nNow, the problem is that there are A LOT of these messages and so they clutter up my main inbox. As it stands, I can simply see the messages in the smartbox, but they reside in the main inbox. \nIs there anyway I can get these messages to move from my main inbox to the smartbox?\n\nA: A smart mailbox is just a virtual mailbox showing mails which match certain rules. This means that you can't physicallye move mail into a smart mailbox.\nIn your case you could create a physical mailbox folder instead and use mail rules to move mail matching the subject string directly into this folder on arrival. Apple has a support article explaining how to use rules which might help here.\n\nA: The short answer is no. Smart mailboxes are basically filters. All mail is still in the original mailbox. Or as Apple puts it:\n\nA Smart Mailbox shows in one location messages that are stored in other mailboxes. For example, a Smart Mailbox might show all messages from a specific sender or with a certain type of attachment, regardless of the mailbox where they’re stored.\n  Source.\n\nYou could however create your own sort of smart mailboxes by using rules to move messages around based on certain characteristics. https://support.apple.com/guide/mail/use-rules-to-manage-emails-you-receive-mlhlp1017/mac.\nFirst create your folders.

This should give you an idea how to work with rules and folders.\n", "Q: How to stop iTunes to auto download \"Available apps\" on start? I have downloaded few apps on my iDevice and stopped the download realizing that was not the intended app.Whenever I start my iTunes, it tries to download them.\nHow can I stop the apps from getting downloaded ?\n\nA: Go to iTunes Menu Item => Preferences => iTunes Store => Disable Apps under Automatic Downloads\n\n", "Q: Download Xcode with developer account and then change account I have a developer account now, and I can download Xcode 5.\nBut soon I won't need this account anymore, and I may\nget a new (organization type) account.\nMy question is, will I be able to use my new organization\naccount to write programs with Xcode 5 I downloaded previously?\nAnd also submit possibly with this new account?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes.\nIf you submit the app to the App Store using your first account, then you can use iTunes Connect App Transfer to transfer it to a new account.\nIf you work on the app without submitting it to the App Store, you can change account and there will be no problems (you will have to change the App ID & provisioning profiles if you obtained these with the old account).\n\nA downloaded copy of Xcode is not linked to an account, so you can use Xcode with any account, or no account.\nThe limitations come with the documentation - pre-release documentation will not be available in Xcode if you don't link an account, however Xcode will still work fine without the documentation.

I'm having difficulties playing games without a live connection to the internet (actually to the steam servers).\nIs this a configuration issue or a limitation in the following game titles:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tomb Raider 2013\n\n*PAYDAY 2\n\n*Dead Island\nI'm hoping to host multiplayer games with my friends without needing Wi-Fi or LAN that connects to the Internet or an external / central game server. \n\nA: On the Steam website (through the links you listed) the only one listing \"broadband internet connection\" as a requirement is TR 2013. The other two have no requirements for internet connection indicated.\nThat said, I have not played any of those games so I cannot certify that the specifications are correct. But I would think they are pretty careful with those, given all the debate going on regarding internet connection requirements for gaming.\nOn the other hand, I am quite sure that if you want to host multiplayer games with your friends you DO need some kind of LAN connection (wi-fi or wired).\n", "Q: How do I Create a Macro or Shortcut to run a Command Sequence Terminal The following was posted by Codler as an answer to a question of read/write difficulties on NTFS drive which worked perfectly.\nMy question is, is there a way for a noob like me to create a shortcut method of running these steps in Terminal instead of typing it in each time I want to mount the drive?\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Plug-in your device\n  \n*Write in Terminal diskutil list and look for IDENTIFIER where TYPE is Windows_NTFS.\nIn this case it is disk1s1\n  \n*Then run the following:\ndiskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1\ncd /Volumes\nmkdir Elements\nsudo mount -w -t ntfs -o rw,nobrowse /dev/disk1s1 /Volumes/Elements\nopen /Volumes/Elements\n\n\n\nA: You don't want the hard drive to show up in the Finder? I had a similar need in the past, and solved it by adding a line to /etc/fstab:\nLABEL=<disk label> <mount point> ntfs auto,nobrowse\n\nwhere:\n\n\n*\n\n*<mount point> is the directory where you want to mount the hard drive, in your case /Volumes/Elements. I'd recommend, though, that you mount the drive elsewhere to prevent name collisions, as /Volumes is used by the Finder to mount removable drives. Let's say you choose /MyVolumes.\n\n*<disk label> is the hard drive name as it appears in the Finder, I guess Elements.\nSo, in your case, the line should read:\nLABEL=Elements /MyVolumes/Elements ntfs auto,nobrowse\n\nNow, /etc/fstab is a system file so care must be taken not to break anything:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications>Utilities>Terminal.\n\n*In Terminal, type:\nsudo mkdir -p /MyVolumes/Elements\n\nto create the folder /MyVolumes/Elements.\n\n*Now type:\nsudo cp -a /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak\nsudo cp /etc/fstab ~/Desktop/fstab.txt\nsudo chown $(whoami) ~/Desktop/fstab.txt\n\nType your password when asked.\nThese commands: 1) create a copy of /etc/fstab you can fallback to if anything goes wrong, 2) copy /etc/fstab to your Desktop, 3) change ownership of the copy on your Desktop so that you can edit it.\n\n*Switch to the Finder, double click fstab.txt on your Desktop and add at the bottom of the file (the file is probably empty) the following:\nLABEL=Elements /MyVolumes/Elements ntfs auto,nobrowse\n\nPress ⌘S to save the file and ⌘Q to close the editor.\n\n*Back to Terminal, type:\nsudo mv -f ~/Desktop/fstab.txt /etc/fstab\n\nto overwrite /etc/fstab with your modified version.\n\n*Plug in your drive.

Normally, when things work, you wouldn't know how the screen gets drawn, but here you can see a problem in one of the steps.\nIf you are comfortable swapping RAM - you might try removing half the ram and test, then swap the second half, but this is likely something you'll take in for a technician to look at once you have a good backup. \nYou could also try reinstalling the OS, but my guess is you would see graphics errors when booted to install DVD or even the built in tests which would confirm it's hardware.\n\nA: From your screenshots this seems like a hardware issue, likely with either the video card or RAM.  Since the issue shows up in screenshots you can at least rule out the LCD panel and the associated video cables.  If it's available you might try booting to another operating system to see if the video abnormalities persist as this could possibly be software related as well.\nI would start by running AHT (Apple Hardware Test), the diagnostic tool that shipped with all Macs.  Depending on the history of your Mac it could be built in or would be found on the gray restore DVDs that shipped with your Mac.  To run AHT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power down your Mac normally, by clicking on the Apple menu and choosing Shut Down\n\n*Power on your Mac while holding D on your keyboard\n\n*Keep holding D until your Mac either shows the icon below or the normal Apple logo / boot screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If your Mac boots normally you will need to try these steps again, but first insert the gray DVD that came with your Mac.  I forget which one contains AHT so you may have to try both disc 1 and then disc 2.\n\n*Once AHT loads you will choose the middle tab, Hardware Tests\n\n*The only option here is whether or not you want to run a quick (default) or extended test.  The extended test is much more thorough when checking RAM but it does take quite a bit longer.  In your situation I would recommend the extended test.\n\n*Depending on the outcome of the test you will either be presented with a cryptic error message or a \"No trouble found\" message.  The latter is obvious.  See my answer from a few days ago on how to decipher the error messages that AHT returns.\n\n\nIf AHT returns no trouble found after a couple extended testing passes then I would encourage you to try booting to another operating system (Snow Leopard / Lion on another Mac via target disk mode for example) to see if the issue persists.  If the iMac works with no issues while using a different OS then I'd say the next step is to perform a reinstallation of Snow Leopard.\nHopefully that gets you started!  Worst case you can make an appointment to take it into an Apple store, if convenient, and have them diagnose it for free at the Genius Bar.\n", "Q: Outgoing e-mail server from Safari / text document When I send/share a URL in Safari I want the default outgoing sender to be my gmail and not iCloud address.  How do I set that. Also when I'm in a text document and I want to share/email it, the default shows my iCloud email, but I want it to be gmail.  I know I can change the outgoing in the e-mail program, but I want it to be the default.\nInside the e-mail program gmail is set as the default outgoing server.  The problem arises only when I'm sending/e-mailing/sharing straight from Safari or a document on my MacBook Pro.  When the e-mail program comes up the @iCloud account is the default outgoing server.\n\nA: Assuming you're using OSX 10.8, under Mail > Preferences > Composing, the drop-down menu for \"Send new messages from\" can be changed from the default \"Account of selected mailbox\" to the specific account you want (in your case, the Gmail account).\n", "Q: How to uninstall zsh I'm new to Mac. A friend installed all kinds of additional software including zsh which I would like to uninstall. So how can I uninstall zsh?\n\nA: If your friend changed the command that shells are opened with, you can change it back to the default login shell from Terminal's preferences:\n\nIf the default login shell was changed, you can change it back to /bin/bash by running chsh -s /bin/bash.\nzsh is included with OS X (in /bin/zsh), but even if your friend installed a newer version of zsh, you don't necessarily need to uninstall or remove it.\n", "Q: Creating screenshots of iOS devices from OSX without Xcode Is there a way to create screenshots of iOS devices from OSX without using Xcode? I am looking for a fast way to do that.\nI know 2 methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Xcode\n\n*Taking a screenshot on the device and sharing it using message/mail whatever\n\n\nbut both these methods are cumbersome and slow. I want to be able to create those screenhots fast.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: You could use airplay mirroring to an Apple TV or your Mac and take screenshots from those output displays\nEdit: Also, just enable photo stream on iPhoto and your phone and it'll automatically upload any screenshots you take with the power and home buttons.

In the present instance \nsmb://the_windows_server/home/my_folder\n\nI do not have read privileges for the_windows_server/home/. The upshot is that OSX mounts the_windows_server/home, which has a nice 'not accessible' icon, and I stuck outside the folder I own and I want access to.\nI am on OS X 10.8.4, samba provided by the OS.  I know I could do something to the windows server, but I do not manage it and I know it will be a painful and drawn out process to sort out if I try the 'ask the IT guys to fix the windows server' approach.  I would like to explore possible solutions on my OS X side of the equation.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly you are able to mount the folder via samba, but you can't read the upper folder within the share.\nTo access the folder you have access to you can go directly to the folder using the 'Go to Folder' option in Finder: Click 'Go' in the menu bar and choose 'Go to Folder':\n\nOr hit Command + Shift + G.\nI assume your samba share is mounted as /Volumes/home/my_folder, so enter this path in the text box that shows up and hit enter. Finder should open a new window showing your folder within the share.\nIf your share is mounted on a different path you could check the folder /Volumes for its name, using the same method as described above.\n", "Q: Determine age of iPhone unit How can I determine the manufacture date/age of any iPhone device?

And if not, how do I reinstall the system in case one day everything goes wrong?\nThank you.\n\nA: The newer Mac minis (and I believe all other Macs as well) ship without restore media.  All of the newer models now have recovery volumes and an option for internet recovery built into their firmware.  The recovery volume (and internet recovery) has an option to download and reinstall the OS without the need for external physical media.\n\nOS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion include a feature called Recovery that includes all of the tools you need to reinstall OS X, repair your disk, and even restore from a Time Machine backup without the need for optical discs.\n\nYou can read more at Apple's \"About OS X Recovery\" KB article.\nApple also provides a tool that allows you to create a similar recovery partition on a USB thumb drive.  About Recovery Disk Assistant\n\nA: Apple does not provide OSX DVDs anymore. But you can burn one yourself (cf this Tutorial) \n\nA: No DVD is included.\nYou use the Recovery Partition on the Mini itself to restore OSX.

I have chosen to use my new MacBook Air as the router.\nI have connected my Air to the Internet with USB Ethernet and setup Internet Sharing to my Wifi. This works fine. I can connect other devices to my Air via wifi and access the Internet. Great!\nNow I want to intercept this traffic and modify it on-the-fly. I figured I need a proxy to do this but I need a transparent one, where I don't have to do any configuration on the device. I found that mitmproxy offers exactly these features. So I have it running on 127.0.0.1:8080, ready to intercept traffic.\nUnfortunately I am stuck trying to redirect my traffic coming in from the wifi (en2) on port 80 and 443 to 127.0.0.1:8080. The mitmproxy docs suggest a config for pfctl but it doesn't work. I noticed that Apple has provided some config for Internet Sharing, enabling NAT. So if I don't use their configuration then the Internet Sharing stops working. And when I try to add the rdr lines to their config it doesn't take effect (tried several places in the file /etc/pf.conf). My traffic just passes on to the Internet, bypassing the mitmproxy.\n\nA: I found the answer.\nI loaded my rules as part of the anchor com.apple/100.InternetSharing/natpmp which is the one used for Internet Sharing.\nThe file mitm.pf.conf contains the rules:\nrdr on bridge0 proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080\nrdr on bridge0 proto tcp from any to any port 443 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080`\n\nLoad it using the Internet Sharing anchor:\nsudo pfctl -a com.apple/100.InternetSharing/natpmp -f mitm.pf.conf\n\n\nA: In a similar situation I have used the firewall to redirect traffic from one NIC to the proxy. You could use something like that:\n$ sudo ipfw add fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from not me to any 80 in via en1\n$ sudo ipfw add fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from not me to any 443 in via en1\n\nIf worked ok for me.\nYou can also use the free WaterRoof program as a GUI to configure the firewall. It does not add anything to the ipsw command, it just gives you easier access to all the options.\nThis page helped me a lot in setting up my configuration:\nhttp://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/1/6/osx-wifi-proxy/\n", "Q: Which would be better for FCP and Pro Tools? Mac Mini 2.3GHz i7Quad or iMac 2.9GHz i5 Quad? I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question.  I've been a post production recording engineer and sound editor for 20 years, but for the last 4 I've been on disability because of arthritis and Crohn's Disease and so I haven't been keeping up on the technology.  I'd like to start trying to at least do a bit of freelance work but my MacBook Pro 2.2GHz Core 2 Duo just doesn't have the muscle any more.\nKeeping in mind that cost is absolutely a consideration, I'm looking at a Mac Mini 2.3GHz i7 Quad Core 4GB RAM (or 2.5GHz i5 Dual Core 8GB RAM) and a 24\" Dell IPS HD monitor or an iMac 2.7GHz i5 Quad Core 8GB RAM 21.5\".  I know both monitors would be the same resolution and the iMac monitor would probably look better, but I don't know which computer is better suited to my current needs.  At least for now I'd be running Pro Tools 8 and FCP Studio.  I know I'll have to learn FCPX at some point...but one thing at a time.  I don't need to have both programs open at the same time, so multi-tasking isn't a big consideration.  For the most part, data would be on external USB 3 drives.  But a couple of other questions.  Would I need to add RAM to the Mini?  Will the Mini support an IPS monitor and ALSO an HDMI monitor as a preview screen?  How much difference is Dual Core vs. Quad Core? I could get the 2.5GHz Dual Core Mini for only $600, and then add the extra RAM.\nI'm one of those rabid Apple lovers so I'd obviously prefer the iMac, but I can't spend an extra couple of hundred dollars just because it'll look better on my desk.  However LONGEVITY is as big a concern as cost.  I'm likely going to need this computer to do the job for quite a while!  So I know that for now the software I'm using doesn't really make use of multiple cores, but newer software will right?  Other than security, is there a big difference between the i5 and i7?  Also, I don't need to start tomorrow, so what is the rumour mill saying about new release dates?  Will new iMacs have Retina displays?  I've checked a bunch of rumour sites but nobody has any RELIABLE information.\nI'm sorry, I know it's a very loooong question and it seems like I've done no research on my own.  I have done some, but the answers vary greatly.  So any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.  If I can spend $900 dollars instead of $1300 I can eat next month (that's a joke - it's not THAT bad).  But I don't want to regret the purchase a year from now!\n\nA: Actually, the most important hardware component in video rendering is videocard (GPU).\niMac has discrete NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M adapter with dedicated memory, while Mac Mini has integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 card. The difference is jaw-dropping. Some benchmarks to prove this:\n\n\n*\n\n*3DMark 11: 2320 points in 650M, only 604 points in HD 4000.\n\n*3DMark 11 (GPU): 2112 points in 650M, only 524 points in HD 4000.\n\n*3DMark 06: 13453 points in 650M, only 4410 points in HD 4000.\n\n\nI believe, you got the point. HD 4000 is a bit less powerful than NVIDIA 610M. Quad-core processor will not matter when integrated graphics will render every frame for 2 seconds.\n\nGeekbench is more about CPU, than GPU. Video editing is more about\n  GPU, than CPU.\n\n8 Gb of RAM is enough for working with 4K@24fps projects.\nThis fall new Macs will be released with better hardware and the new OS X Mavericks will roll out with performance (CPU and memory) improvements (more free RAM for FCPX).\nSo I advice you to wait for a while with buying new Mac. Get better.\n\nA: According to everymac.com the mac mini configuration is more capable \n(geekbench results for 32 and 64-bit OS'es respectively)\nMac Mini 2.3GHz i7  10626/11825*\niMac \"Core i5\" 2.9 21.5-Inch 9202/10756*\npersonally i would add 4GB or 8GB more to the mac mini at some later time. (not at the time of buying though as apple tends to charge more than say, OWC)\nI think both computers would serve you well for what you want but i would prefer the Mac mini as the iMac is a bit less capable power wise and additionally more difficult to upgrade..\n", "Q: How can i see my iPad screen on a web browser I'm looking for an application that enables me to preview my iPad screen, on a PC or Mac Desktop.

As you know, the sound volume of Mac laptops isn't too loud.\nI bought Boom, a volume-booster software for Macs, and after some months of using it for listening to music or viewing videos at loud volume, the bass of my MacBook Pro's internal speakers died.\nNow the laptop has very feeble sound, no bass at all. Sound through external speakers has not been affected.\nSometimes the bass seems to come and go as if something is loose inside.\nI suspect the loud volume achieved with Boom caused vibrations that damaged the speakers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I right ? \n\n*Is Boom the culprit ?\n\n*Has this happened to anyone ?\n\n\nA: Boom is most likely the culprit to your speaker failing. Boom uses algorithms to increase the overall volume of the track to a point without clipping. Pushing speakers beyond what they are supposed to do can and will cause damage to them. The reason the speakers have a maximum volume is that is the safest high fidelity sound they can produce. \nHere is a review of how boom works algorithmically http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/review/boom_lets_you_turn_your_macs_volume_up_to_eleven \nNote the overall wave form increase in the article. This will cause damage, clipping and distortion with prolonged use. \n\nA: A bit of background as to how this type of software can blow your speakers.\nBoom is a compressor, in fact a brick-wall limiter.\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression\nWhat these devices do - & they are used a lot in the music industry to even out sound levels; sometimes tastefully, sometimes to try to gain another step in the Loudness War <- see my own answer on Music Fans for a not-too-technical explanation)\nThey do this, not by making the loud bits quieter, but by making the quiet bits louder - this increases the apparent loudness of the overall signal.\nMusic using extreme compression does sound louder, at the expense of any dynamic range - loud & quiet.\n…and here is where that is no good for your speakers…\nA speaker is a magnet with coil of wire wrapped round it, attached to which is a cone of paper or plastic [the speaker itself]\nIf you run an alternating current through that, it makes the coil move & the speaker sound.\nThe energy supplied to the cone is dissipated as the cone 'wastes' that energy by pushing & pulling at the air in front of it - that's how you can hear the sounds, of course.\nBut... not all the energy is transmitted as sound, there is wastage & that wastage is heat.  \nYour speakers were designed to be able to dissipate the heat of a normal music stream - Radio, CD, MP3, etc - even on full volume.\nAdd software to make that speaker move far more than it was ever designed to do & the heat build-up will eventually melt the wire in the coil, if it doesn't actually vibrate the entire structure to breakage first.\nIt takes much more energy to produce bass frequencies than treble frequencies, so in a 2-way speaker system, the bass is just more likely to give out first.\n\nA: my 2010 macbook pros's subwoofer speaker broken after 1 years I installed iboom, the thin membrane just ripped away. I would not suggest people installing iBoom\n\nA: They're laptop speakers.\nIf you want music and films to sound good, plug your MacBook into proper speakers or headphones.\nNo technology on the planet can make thumb-sized laptop speakers sound better than what Apple delivers out of the box. Apart from processing the signal and equalizing it, making it sound louder stresses the driver and degrades the quality.\nGet the digital audio or line level analog out to a proper amplifier if you need loud or a better quality is my advice.\n\nA: Yes, Boom is the culprit. It tore my speaker cones on Macbook Pro 2012 non retina. Boom not even once mentioned it would cause such issues, it similarly damaged my wired headphones after a year of boom boost.\n\nA: Boom by WILL damage your speakers!\nDon't use it or any other sound boosting apps.\n\nA: Boom 2 made my speakers distort, until I reinstalled OSX. That resolved the issues, and decided not to use Boom 2 again\n", "Q: Is an older version of Python a necessity? ML 10.8.4 and I have installed Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3.  I keep reading that it's necessary to keep the the 2.6 version around because the system uses it.  However, I've not found any software that needs it other than that which I installed (and I can control which version THAT needs - I complied and installed SciPy for 3.3.2 for example).  So, using macports I pointed the python link to the 3.3.2 install to see if there is something hidden that I've missed.  I've not had any problems.\nSo I'm wondering if it's even necessary to keep the old versions around.  I am aware that this will limit certain versions of python scripts that I install.\nDoes anyone know what I definitively will break by having python link to 3.3.2 in a base install of ML?\nAlso, I suspect that the 2.6 version is an old hanger on from Snow Leopard (machine migration) as supposedly, ML uses 2.7.  But I can't confirm that.\n\nA: While there are obviously differences in the different versions of Python, there are also differences between the \"system\" Python and those you install via Python.org, MacPorts, Homebrew, etc. All of these \"additional\" versions can coexist quite happily with the system versions in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions - I have 2.3, 2.5.6, 2.6.7, and 2.7.2 on my 10.8.4 iMac which originally came with Lion installed. /usr/bin/python is 2.7.2.\nBasically, there is no good reason to get rid of any of the system Pythons (they only take up ~200MB), and some very good reasons to not get rid of them. They are included for a reason, and there are various system utilities and programs that depend on them. You could get strange, unexplained behavior if you remove them, and vital stuff may not work, as Python scripts and libraries are behind some major system tools. Python has been designed to have multiple versions living happily side-by-side, so if your system is set up properly (which I generally trust the Apple engineers to have done), there won't be any conflicts as hypothesized by another answer. \nIf you want to change which version of Python runs by default when you type python into the Terminal prompt, then change your $PATH environment variable to point toward your installation of choice, do not unlink or change /usr/bin/python. For example, I use MacPorts, so /opt/local/bin is ahead of /usr/bin in my $PATH, so I never run the \"system\" version 2.7.2. You can then start your scripts with \n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nand it will search your path for the correct binary.\nYou should have no problems at all using MacPorts point to your version of choice. One thing I would suggest, though, is to keep /opt/local/bin/python pointing to the latest version of Python 2 (2.7.5, currently), and use /opt/local/bin/python3 point to 3.3.2. Yes, you have to remember to add the 3 on the end of the command, but several months back I tried setting python to Py3, and occasionally would get weird errors from some programs expecting Py2 to be there.\nHopefully this helps answer your actual question, please let me know if you need anything else.\n\nA: Having multiple versions of Python around isn't actually a bad thing, particularly if certain applications might have version dependencies. The main concern would be that of dependencies and versions — and indirectly permissions. \nIf you decide to get rid of the older version then be aware there are quite a few items you'll need to reconfigure to ensure everything is able to work just as well as it did before. If you're more concerned with having to manage multiple versions of Python I would recommend virtualenv; it's a nice tool to create isolated Python environments. \nPro's for getting rid of Python 2.6:\n• Apple listed Python 2.6 as security-fix-only (no more updates)\n• Two versions of Python on the same machine can potentially have conflicts\n• It's easier to maintain, while potentially freeing up disk space\n\nPro's for having two versions of Python:\n• Less worrying about certain applications not working because of broken dependencies\n• The ability to have different versions of Python!\n• Having a newer version allows you to use newer/cool packages\n\nIf you decide to commit to deleting Python 2.6 I would check out this excellent and thorough guide to upgrading: \nhttp://wolfpaulus.com/jounal/mac/installing_python_osx\nIf you decide to keep both versions then have a look at virtualenv.\nThe choice really is ultimately up to you.\n\nA: i got lots of sw \"that requires say python 2.6 on mac os x 10.8.4\". whether or not that same sw is on your computer i would not know.?\non a stock system if you delete 2.6 the only way it \"won't break\" is if you uninstall it correctly and then install the other correctly. fairly simple logic to understand i gather.\n", "Q: Default 'Authentication Required' dialog username I've got a 13\" MBP running 10.8. I recently changed my full name of my account, but whenever I get an authentication dialog, it has pre-filled in my old full name.

There is no earthing pin, only a socket with a metallic rim. Will it require some special socket that has a projecting earth pin?\nThis is for use in India @ 230W. My adaptor is 85w.\n\nA: The ground / earth is comprised of the outer-most two pins in the MagSafe connector (both original and the thinner + wider MagSafe 2) and requires that the ground be connected to the other end of your AC to DC adapter.\n\nRather than using a two prong plug, you could use a longer two prong cord and then ground the metal disc that serves to hold the \"duck head\" on the transformer/rectrifier/filter that makes up the bulk of the MagSafe adapter.\n\n\nA: The transformer is double insulated and thus does not require to be grounded. It's the same with your mobile charger and external hard-drive PSU.\nThe outer most pins are ground (-), the 2nd and 4th are high (+) and the middle is for the Mac to signal the led on the connector:\nhttp://pinoutsguide.com/Power/magsafe_power_pinout.shtml\nThe ground in the connector is NOT the same as the ground in your wall. The connector uses DC and the wall AC, and therefore it sounds complicated.\n\nA: The MagSafe Power cable can either put an extension cable or a plug on the 'brick'. I've noticed that if I only use the plug on the brick, then the aluminium case 'tingles' when I touch it. \nIf I use the extension cable on the brick, then the tingling is not present.

It normally charged from Apple 5W USB Power Adapter [Model No.:A1299] (output 5.0V, 1A), and normally charged from macbook USB port and required just 0.5A for charging.\n\nWhy it won't charge from LG adapter whose output current (0.85A) actually is between laptop USB port (0.5A) and Apple USB Power Adapter (1A)?\n\nA: I looked into the amount of current available from a USB charger when investigating how to charge multiple iPhones / iPads simultaneously.  Below is something I learnt that might be relevant.\nThere are several different ways that a charger can \"tell\" an iPod how much current it can provide - the iPod can't determine this directly.  If the charger is a computer, it will communicate this through a data transfer (similar to transferring MP3 file data).\nBut a simple charger won't use this method.  Instead, there are various standards (some proprietary, I believe!) which specify how much current can be provided, by providing certain voltages at the data lines.  USB has four pins: one ground, one power, and two data.  For example, apparently 2.8V on one of the data pins and 2.0V on another means \"you can draw up to 1 amp\".  See this link for some detail, although I think some of that is out-dated.\nI'd guess that the LG adaptor doesn't provide the signalling that the iPod expects.  I don't know a way to resolve this, other than to try a different adaptor - sorry.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut that I could use to set a task priority in Reminders.app on a Mac? I know that if I want to create a new task in Reminders and I write something like:\n\nBuy milk tomorrow at 3:00pm\n\nReminder.app understands by itself that the date and the time of execution of the task will be tomorrow at 3:00pm and it will set both of them for me. So I don't need to select the task, push the \"i\" button, check the option \"Remind me on a day\" and set a time and a date.\nMy question is quite simple, and is this:\nIs it possible to do the same for priorities ?\nI mean: I'd like to write something like:\n\nBuy milk !!\n\nand see the app that understands that the two exclamation points on the task mean that it has an higher priority. I tried to use different sentences and AFAIK there's no way of telling Reminders to set the priority for me, without having to manually set it. That would be super-handy for me.\nBut I might be wrong, and this is why I'm asking you if there's any way to avoid having to go in the options of each task and set the priority.\nThank you and best regards\n\nA: Yes.

I don't want to extend the network of the TC since then I would risk connecting to the Airport Express instead of the TC with my other devices, which would be undesirable.\n\nA: On a Windows version of Airport Utility ctrl-click on the \"wireless mode\" menu will give you an additional option \"join a wireless network\".  Without ctrl the option is hidden.\n\nA: You can do the setup to extend the network and then change it to 'join a wireless network' afterwards under the Wireless tab in airport utility. That's how I setup mine\n\nA: Yes, you can configure an Airport Express to connect to an existing WiFi network in client mode.\nFrom Apple's support site, AirPort Express: How to join an existing Wi-Fi network in client mode:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect an appropriate cable between the AirPort Express and the device it will serve.\n  \n*Plug the AirPort Express into a power outlet.\n  \n*After the AirPort Express starts up, select it in the AirPort Utility screen.\n  \n*If you are now repurposing the AirPort Express, first reset it from Base Station in the menu bar and select Restore Default Settings.\n  \n*After the AirPort Express completes the restore process, choose it from the Wi-Fi menu in the upper-left corner.\n  \n*Click the Other Options button.\n  \n*Select \"Add to an existing network\".\n  \n*Choose the Wi-Fi network name from the Wireless Network Name menu that you wish to join and click next.\n  \n*Enter the password to this network if required.\n  \n\n\nA: The question was whether one could configure an Airport EXTREME in client mode.\nThe first \"answer\" answered whether an Airport EXPRESS could be configured in client mode.\nI am using Airport Utility 6.3.5 to configure both an Airport Express and an Airport Extreme.  When configuring the Express, \"join a network\" is an option;\nbut not with an Extreme.  However, when I configure the Express to \"create network\", and then configure the Extreme to extend that network, the Extreme does in fact forward packets received on its LAN ports wirelessly to the Express, and onward towards the internet.  So the defacto result is that the Extreme is acting as a \"gaming adapter\", or \"client bridge\".\nNote: after I configured the Extreme to extend a network, I went back to see if the \"join\" option became available; it had not.\n\nA: I tried doing the same, and I managed to see the option to join a network by pressing and holding the option key on my Mac while selecting the field where the option should be. \n\nA: I have 2 airport extremes. I set one up as a passthrough wired from a Uverse modem. Then set another on up wirelessly for a USB printer in my living room. I used Airport Utility on my mac to set up and couldn't find an option to not extend the network. However if my devices connected to the wireless one, the speed was lost a bunch so I wanted to just connect all my devices to the passthrough one. Just found out that if I go on Airport Utility on my windows laptop, there is an box says \"allow wireless clients\". Just unchecked it and it worked. It's weird that AU windows version has more options to mess with than the mac version.\n\nA: :EDIT:  I have just tried this again and although I can \"join a wireless network\" with the Airport EXTREME, I cannot get it into client mode which would give out internet or LAN to the ports on the back.  bummer.  So I'm thinking this tool is only really good for the old Airport Expresses that no longer work with the new Airport Utility 6:\nWith just a bit of help from a script that opens the old Airport Utility 5.6 on your Mac using OS Mavericks or above. \nDownload from here:\nhttps://zcs.zyniker.org/airport-utility-v5-6-1/\nThen ...\nFirst rename your current Airport Utility to something like Airport Utility 6\nThen (in this order) drag the utility launcher to your Utilities folder.. authenticate\nThen Drag Airport Utility 5.6 to your Utilities folder .. authenticate\nThen double click on the launcher (the one you previously dragged to your Utilities folder)\nIt will open Airport Utility.  In the wireless section hold down the \"option\" key and \"join a network\" will be there.\nHow the Launcher Does What It Does\nWith the release of OS X 10.9 “Mavericks” Apple updated file Apple80211 (contained in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A). Whatever the other effects of this update, it broke backwards compatibility with older versions of AirPort Utility. Thankfully, the fix is simple: Inject an older version of the file when launching older versions of AirPort Utility. This is precisely what the Launcher does.\nWhen you run the Launcher, it simply injects the OS X 10.8 “Mountain Lion” version of file Apple80211 (which the Launcher contains) and then runs AirPort Utility 5.6.1 (which is included in the download of the Launcher). That’s it. One file is the difference between AirPort Utility 5.6.1 running and throwing an error under more recent versions of OS X.\n", "Q: Can Scrivener 2 import a TeX file? I've found the way to publish a TeX document with Scrivener 2.\nNow I'm curious that whether Scrivener 2 has a capability of importing a LaTeX file and establishing a Scrivener style document structure or not.\nI'm asking it because I'm writing a paper with other people who are not using Scrivener.\n\nA: Scrivener 2 does import LaTeX files as RTF (see dialog box below).\n\nI imported a sample LaTeX file into a Scrivener project, and the result was test-latex.scriv. See below.\n\n", "Q: How to delete thousands of contact email addresses A year ago when I upgraded my iPhone to the latest model, the computer technician who works on our business computers helped me with a couple of issues with which I was having problems.  He doesn't know what happened, but he ended up importing my complete business address book email addresses into my iPhone and now I have over 4,000 contacts of customers I will never contact with my personal iPhone.\nThis presents a great problem for me each time I want to look up a personal contact, I have to wade through hundreds of names until I find the one I need.   Is there a program that will allow me to work with this huge contacts list outside of the iPhone (such as on my regular computer with a large screen) and permanently delete those contacts that I don't need?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will solve the problem exactly as you specified, but you can hide those 4000 contacts of customers on your iPhone with the steps below.\nIf your entire email's contacts are synced with your iPhone, you can choose to display only actual contacts and hide those email contacts with the Groups button in the Contacts.app in iPhone\n\nFor instance, this is a sample screen that could show when you touch Groups\n\n(source: pcadvisor.co.uk)\nAlso, if you go to your Mail settings on your iPhone (Settings => Mail, Contacts, Calendars) and your Mail account, you can choose to remove your email contacts from your iPhone contacts by turning Contacts off in the picture below.\n\n\nA: The only method that I can come up with is enabling iCloud on your iPhone and delete the contacts your don’t need from iCloud.\nSince the contacts are synchronized online, anything you’ve deleted from the iCloud will also be applied to your iPhone. If you use Mac, you can also use the Contacts app to manage your existing contacts (by ensuring your iCloud on Mac is also enabled)\nPS. You can find iCloud in System Preferences.\n\nA: Just to basically state an implementation of an answer I found here regarding the creation of a group within the contacts tree in your Outlook. \n\n\n*\n\n*What you should do is to create a new group \"mobile\", and then go into you other lists - \"do a list view> and group them by mobile number\" - then drag all the contacts that have mobile numbers to your new group. \n\n*Do this for all your lists. Then set visibility on the \"groups tab\" in contacts to the new group mobile and voila!\n\nA: My issue was Exchange syncing contacts.\nI got the clue from the answer above. There is an option under groups to remove the tick from Suggested Contacts. This reduced my contacts to just those with phone numbers that I had added.\n", "Q: Figuring out what Photo Stream is uploading exactly Even though I have unchecked the Automatic Upload of Photo Stream on Aperture (same on iPhoto), I can see through Little Snitch that it is hogging my upload bandwith constantly.\nWhen I wait (hours, days..) to see what was uploaded, nothing is added to my photo stream.\nIs there any way to figure out live what is being uploaded?\nHere is what the Console returns when I block Photo Stream's outgoing connections:\nMSPublisher - 1307885906 Encountered temporary network issues during upload. Will try again later...\n\nThank you!\n\n\nA: If Aperture's activity window isn't showing you the file name of what is being uploaded then my suggestion is a bit terminal intensive (you've been warned).\n$ sudo fs_usage | grep 'DSC_'\nyou can replace what's in the ' ' with the beginning of your image names or even the suffix of .jpeg or .nef or what have you. You should even be able to write 'Aperture' just make sure that Aperture isn't in the foreground because that will give you automatic outputs from window server displaying the application being drawn.\nThis will output a list updated every millisecond of what files are being touched. So close all other programs you don't need and let Aperture try to do it's thing and terminal print it out. Fingers crossed!\n", "Q: How do I stop iTunes 11 from randomly match SD and HD episodes of a TV-series? I'm trying to add my entire TV-series collection to iTunes so I can easily view it on my AppleTV. Everything was great until I tried to add DVD-rips and BD-rips of the same show. Now it just randomly matches the qualities. It might match Season 2 episode 4 (DVD) with Season 4 Episode 9 (BD). Some series from Blu-rays are in 720p and some in 1080p, and I have the same problem with them! iTunes matches them completely at random.\nI've been trying everything (or at least what it feels like)!\nTags I've used are different between episodes: Episode name, Release date, Sort episode name, Short description, Long description, ContentID, TV Episode number, Track number.\nTags shared within a season: Copyright, XID, TV season number, Album, Disk number.\nMy temporary (and very, VERY space consuming) solution has been to make each and every episode in all the lower quality ratings available – a 1080p episode will be made into both a 720p and SD file also, a 720p will also be made into an SD file. I have over 4,000 episodes in my library, and it's very annoying to have at least two qualities of all of them.\nAnyone out there that has a solution? How do I make iTunes understand that Season 3 Episode 10 and Season 6 Episode 5 are different from Season 1 Episode 6?\n\nA: Have you tried directly editing the info in iTunes?\nFor example, you can manually select all of the season 4 TV shows, right click, press the \"Get Info\" button (Not what most people expect)\nYou should see a window like this (when selecting multiple items), which you should be able to directly modify the season number:\n\n\nA: (not able to comment due to low reputation. )\nNot sure about your naming convention, but i'd guess that S00E00 would be pretty standard, so try that and see if it works.\nFor example\ns04e01 Once Upon a Time.mp4\n\nIf this doesn't solve it, could you give more details to the nature of the mapping?\nIs it more like \nmy favourite episode HD.mp4 -> another episode HD.mp4\nor more like \nmy favourite episode HD.mp4 -> my favourite episode SD.mp4\n", "Q: View individual artists in compilation albums? I can't seem to set up my music collection so that when opening a compilation album on my iPad it shows a list of songs on the compilation album along with the artist of each song.\nIn iTunes on my computer it displays as expected - the song name appears with the artist below it in the compilations album:\n\nWhen synced to my iPad and clicking on the same compilation album it displays without the artist name:\n\nNote also that the album artist name below the album thumbnail is one of the track artists.\nThe settings for this album in iTunes on my Mac are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Each song has their artist name and song name completed.\n\n*Album artist is left blank\n\n*Compilation is ticked.\n\n\nWhy are the results correct in iTunes on the computer, but not on the iPad?\n\nA: I've written “Various Artists” in the Album Artist field, and ticked the Compilations box. It works fine for me in iTunes, on my iPad, iPhone, iPod nano and my ATV. So my suggestion is to try write something in the Album Artist field.\n", "Q: Easiest way to send multiple iWork attachments as Office documents My grandmother just switched from a PC to a Mac, and I suggested that she use iWork instead of Office for Mac. Now she is getting used to iWork, but all of the people that she works with use Office.\nWhen she wants to send multiple documents, I told her that she has to open each one and got to Share => Export -> Word and save them to her desktop. After that she needs to attach each one to the email.\nAs I'm telling her this, I think to myself \"There has to be a better way...\"\nSo, I come here to ask: Is there a better way? Is there some way to make Mail convert these .pages documents into .docx, .keynote into .pptx, etc.? I always thought that's what \"Send Windows Friendly Attachments\" did, but I have found out that it does something totally different.\n\nA: The sending of windows friendly attachments doesn't change the file, but it changes how Apple encodes the files into text for transmission. (think using tar and gzip instead of uuencode and compress).\nIf you send many documents in Word format, there's nothing preventing you from storing them all to the filesystem as .doc (or .docx) and letting pages import them when she edits. That way she does the conversion only when she needs to modify a file as opposed to having to do the conversion at send time.\n\nA: There is no easy way to convert iWork documents to Office and then send them via email.  In short, your options are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Pages, don't save as .pages files, but rather as .docx files.  To do this, your grandmother will have to use \"save as\" every time she saves the file, because \"save\" will simply save a .pages file.  You cannot set the default file format in Pages to be a .docx file.\n\n*Continue as she is doing now, and convert each file individually from .pages to .docx when she needs to send it to someone.  \n\n*Buy a legal copy of Office:Mac.  \n\n\nIf your grandmother works with people who use Office, the best solution is for her to use Office:Mac.  Pages can open Word documents, and it can save as a Word document as well, but this conversion is limited.  If the documents have a lot of formatting, they are likely to lose the formatting in the conversion.  If she receives Word documents with macros, she will not be able to use or modify the macros.  Keynote to PowerPoint and Numbers to Excel have similar issues.  We'll leave aside that it sounds like you have violated the EULA for iWork in associating someone else's Apple ID with your grandmother's new Mac.\n\"Send Windows-Friendly Attachments\" does not convert files from one type to another, and you probably don't want Apple Mail (or any other application) performing such a conversion without telling you about it.  It simply changes the encoding that it uses for sending the files via email.  \nThere is no method to batch-convert files from Pages to Word.  Pages' AppleScript and Automator dictionaries don't have commands for such a conversion.  \n\nA: Try iWork Converter, http://tyorex.com/iWorkConverter.\nIt can batch convert Pages files to doc, convert Numbers to xls, convert Keynote to ppt.\n", "Q: Software Recommendation for iOS app to wake Ubuntu computer with MAC Address I have an Ubuntu media server set up.

Could it be that, since I have not rebooted for a few months, some executables keep requiring memory slowing the system down (memory leak)?  \nIs it possible to recover unused but locked memory, without a reboot?  \n\nA: To answer your question, yes, applications and processes continue to start up and if you have not manually closed them or restarted the computer, you will be \"losing\" RAM. You can turn the inactive memory into free memory with this command in Terminal:\nsudo purge\n\nYou can also run Activity Monitor to diagnose what apps are running and sort the list by most memory.\n\nA: I noticed Chrome got mentioned.\nChrome too give me memory trouble. Especially when I open Google Drive, it just go crazy and eat all the RAM, and subsequently all the swap it can get.\nSwitch to Safari and regularly restart memory leaking applications.

SMC reset is not helpful in any case, did OS reinstallations many times with no noticeable effect.\nMBP is 1 year old, I have cleaned it up from dust and also did the thermal plaste reapply (Arctic Cooling MX-4).\nI use iStat pro on Dashboard and iStat menu for temperature monitoring in OSX and Mac fan Control along with Real Temp in Windows 7 (Bootcamp). Room temperature is pretty cold and I use two table fans directed to the MBP to help cool the alu case and also, MBP is elevated about 1,5cm in the back and 0,5cm in the front for better heat dissipation.\nNow for the temps and issue itself:\nIn OSX, it usually idles at about 45C average with default 2000rpm fans, quite no problem with that. All cores are +-3C around 45C. which seem quite fine. When really idling for few minutes, sometimes it goes lower even to 37-40C.\nI do not really game in OSX, but when I do (GRID 2, DIRT 3, and other more demanding games on low to mid settings) I set the fan speeds always to max 6200RPM. But even if I do, temps usually wobbles around 95C and I experience thermal throttling sooner or later. Temps do not stay at 95-100C but they oscillate, probably due to thermal throttling. Temps are generally better in OSX as it should be, but I made another test with Prime95 under both systems.\nOSX:\nI use torture test (in-place large FFTs: maximum heat and power consumption as stated), all four cores go 100% load, which are supposed to. I set fans to 6200rpm everytime I test this. \nStarting from idle temperatures and MBP case pretty cold, temps are like this:\nAfter 3 minutes, C1 is 88C, C2 96, C3 99, C4 95\nAfter 5 minutes, C1 is 91C, C2 99C, C3 101C, C4 98C\nThen it goes celsius by celsius up and up, about 20sec/1C more. Core 1 is usually able to stay under 95C, while C2 and C3 are running up the most, even to 104-105C, C4 is a bit lower, about 101-102C.\nSame torture test under Windows 7 shows similar pattern, except idle temps are about 55C and load temps go up little faster, while gaming under W7 (Battlefield 3 on lowest setting except resolution, which I use native) is experiencing throttling and Realtemp shows reaching 104-105C eventually on C2 and C3.\nOf course, I'm worried about my MBP and I do not want it to suffer any heat damage, so I stopped playing for now and hoping for some solution you guys may help me with.\nPlease notice, that MBP is not under warranty and there is NO apple store in Czech Republic, where I live.\nI did few thermal paste replacements before this one and I believe I made it correctly. Temperatures before the paste replacement we're slightly worse than I have now.\nThanks for reading and your help.\n\nA: I understand your concerns (justified or not), you love your Mac and want to keep it alive as long as possible.\nHere are some home remedy (Do it Yourself)-- (also available where you live).\nIf you want to keep your Mac cooler during HOT games, go to pharmacy and buy what they call a gel-pack (gel balení). Freeze it!\nThen put it under your Mac with a towel in between (to prevent freezing).\nThat will provide additional cooling for few hours. Have second gel-pack if you want to continue gaming for 24 hours a day :)\nAs for your temperature reports, so far they look normal based on this example.\n\nThrottling\nThis test wouldn't be complete if we didn't address the subject of\n  throttling. Prime 95 and Furmark can extract the maximum performance\n  out of the hardware. When both programs are run simultaneously, the\n  core frequency drops (caused by Prime 95) to 1.2 Ghz. Running Prime 95\n  alone, we measured temperatures between 92 and 104 degrees Celsius\n  (197.6 and 219.2 degrees Fahrenheit), and the word \"Throttling\"\n  flashes repeatedly in HWiNFO. Furmark on its own cycles through all\n  available Turbo Boost steps. After about one hour, the temperature\n  settled at a fairly consistent 85 degrees Celsius (185 degrees\n  Fahrenheit) with the fan system running. We never measured above 100\n  degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) with Furmark. This limitation\n  might be due to the power adapter: in the above scenario, the system\n  would require 86.6 watts - but the power adapter can only supply a\n  maximum of 85 watts. Immediately after running our different tests, we\n  subjected the system to 3DMark 06 and CineBench R11.5. The results\n  were identical to after a cold boot.\n\nThe fastest way to quick check is to use the surface temperatures as shown here.\n\n\nA: I have old Macbook Pro and very recent one and overheating problem only got worse. And that is for the brand new one, so it doesn't depend on the model.\nWhat I try and partially works, beyond restarting, is to watch my CPU performance in the Activity Monitor and kill whatever process I can.

The app switches some of the autocorrect features, so that you have to tap on the autocorrect bubble for it to be activated. The app also contains the ability to turn on autocorrect features for correct punctuation, and correct capitalization. Like AutoCorrector, you can create your own list of custom shortcuts.\nLinks/References\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2430621?start=0&tstart=0\nhttp://www.zeropaid.com/news/101147/6-ways-to-improve-your-iphones-autocorrect/\n\nA: In iOS 5, the file is stored at /var/mobile/Library/Keyboard/UserDictionary.sqlite.

My power button doesn't work and I have the white screen of death. The only way to reset the device I've seen is to hold the power and home button and then use restore on iTunes, but I can't do that for obvious reasons.\nAre there any fixes for this?\n\nA: You might be able to use RecBoot. Here is some information quoted from their web site:\n\nRecBoot is a free utility for Windows and Mac users which allow you to put your iPhone / iPod Touch in recovery mode easily. Its a\n  great utility for for those iPhone users who's iPhone Home or\n  Sleep/Wake button is not fully functional. Moreover this utility saves\n  you from learning the 3-4 steps of putting your iPhone into recovery\n  mode manually. Normally you need to put your iPhone into recovery mode\n  when your want to do a firmware restore.\n\nOnce you put it in Recovery Mode, you see a popup on your computer screen saying \"iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode\". From here, you should be able to restore.\nWindows Download\n\nA: Hold the home button until the phone displays the \"Connect to iTunes\" icon.\n", "Q: How to make an existing AppleScript file to work as a service? I made an AppleScript, saved it as a file in a specific folder on my hard drive. Now I want to assign a shortcut to it and looks like I have to make a Service via Automator, but the Run AppleScript asks me to put the code inside, while I want to execute the already existing .scpt file. How to do that?\n\nA: In the script, add an on run argument:\non run\n    -- do whatever the script does\nend run\n\nThen you can use the Automator \"Run Shell Script\" action, with the osascript command:\nosascript /path/to/script.scpt\n\nosascript is a command which executes AppleScript in the shell. You need the lines in the script to allow the script to be executed outside AppleScript editor.\n\nA: Perhaps you'd want to take a look at This Service, which allows you to \"create Mac OS X services from any script.\"\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend creating Automator services to assign shortcuts to scripts. There is a bug in in 10.7 and 10.8 where the keyboard shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. There is also a relatively long (maybe 0.1 to 1 s) delay before services are run.\nSee this answer for other ways to assign keyboard shortcuts to scripts. I use FastScripts and Alfred myself.\n\nA: You can RUN the existing script with a simple automator service like this.\nAnd assign your shortcut from within the keyboard short cuts as normal.\nJust remember some applications may need to be relaunched before they pick the shortcuts up.\nexample.\nsayHello script:\nsay \"hello\"\n\nAutomator service:\n\nWhich in this example uses:\n\n\n*\n\n*No input\n\n*Any application.\nThe Action is a Run Shell Script\nThe code just uses the unix command osascript and the path to the file.\nPass input can be to stdn or to argument\nThats it nothing special needs to be done to the script.\nFor further details on the osascript command look at the man pages for it. The man page give another example where you can pass arguments to the script.\n\nA: Yes, Automator is the best option here. To create the service follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and select Service:\n\n\n*Search 'applescript' and drag the action to the right pane:\n\n\n*Change Service receives selected text to Service receives no input so that it always appears in the Services menu:\n\n\n*Replace (* Your script goes here *) with:\ndo shell script \"/usr/bin/osascript /path/to/your/script.scpt\"\n\nif you wish to execute your existing .scpt file. Note that osascript can't handle user interaction like displaying a dialog window:\n\nTo overcome this limitation either use this workaround or simply replace (* Your script goes here *) with the contents of your script.\n\n*Save it:\n\n\n*If you wish, you can assign a shortcut to your new service. Select Services>Services Preferences in Finder (or any open application):\n\n\n*Assign a not so common shorcut:\n\n\n*Now your service is accessible from any application through the shortcut you assigned in the previous step:\n\nIf you ever want to get rid of the service open ~/Library/Services, delete the service and empty the trash:\n\n\nA: To develop a Service, you need some sort of software which will create a Service such as one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator to  create a .workflow\n\n*ThisService to create a .service\n\n*Xcode to create an .app\n\n\nAll of the above kinds of services are packages.  They are all folders which contain an plist that specifies the attributes of a Service.\nHere is how I created a Service using Automator that uses a \"Run AppleScript\" Automator action to call an existing .script.\n\n", "Q: How do I rename a Shared Photo Stream? The only option in my Shared Photo Stream appears to be \"Edit\", which lets me add/delete photos. Can I rename the title perhaps online somewhere?\n\nA: New method for iOS 7, 8, and 9:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Photos app\n\n*Make sure you're on the iCloud Photo Sharing screen (tap back as necessary)\n\n*Hit Edit (top right)\n\n*Tap on album name text from listing\n\n*Make your edits\n\n*Tap Done to save\n\n\nA: Go back one screen to the main Photo Stream screen. From there, tap on the blue arrow for the Shared Photo Stream you want to change, and you can edit the name, subscribers, etc.\nMain screen showing the blue arrow on the right:\n\nSub-screen after tapping on the Photo Stream I want to modify:\n\n", "Q: Does an iPhone Photo Stream upload store a duplicate of the photo locally? That is to say, does a photo uploaded to Photo Stream and/or a Shared Photo Space take up twice or thrice the space on my phone, or does each instance point to the same single data store?\n\nA: Yes one copy is stored for each \"service\" (for lack of a better word). So if it exists in your Camera Roll, Photo Stream, and a shared Photo Stream, there are three physical files on your phone.\n", "Q: What contributes to my iPhone iCloud backup size? Settings lists my phone's iCloud \"Backup Size\" as 2.2 GB (excluding other phones and general \"Documents & Data\") though all of its apps turned \"on\" for backup below don't even approach 0.5 GB when summed. What else is contributing to this unexpectedly large number, and how can I reduce them?\n\nA: Per Apple, this is what is backed up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchased music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books\n\n*Photos and videos in your Camera Roll\n\n*Device settings\n\n*App data\n\n*Home screen and app organization\n\n*iMessage, text (SMS), and MMS messages\n\n*Ringtones\n\n*Visual Voicemail\n\n\nThings like purchased content, Messages.app, ringtones, and voicemails are not actually explicitly listed in the backup screens for you to see how much space will be used. This would account for the difference.\n", "Q: iPhone contacts aren't syncing to iCloud Contacts on my iPhone 4 are not syncing to iCloud even though it is set as on. It is a new phone, and the contacts synced when I first set up iCloud, but not since. I have tried \"backup now\" and new notes appeared, but no new contacts.\n\nA: This is what worked for me after speaking with a very helpful Apple senior tech agent:\nOpen Settings> Mail, Contacts, Calendars> Contacts – Default Account = must contain a check next to iCloud.That’s it! Now all future contacts created on your iPhone (on your iPad, do the same as above), will also appear in iCloud and Outlook (if you’ve also set up Outlook). \nIf you have contacts that are already only on your iPhone/iPad then you’ll want to: Open Phone> Contacts> Groups (top left corner)> Hide All Contacts (top left corner). Then select/Checkmark all email accounts/accounts you see listed and make sure that iCloud it NOT check marked here while you’re fishing for all those rogue contacts. Click done and what will then be displayed, are contacts that you saved somewhere other than iCloud. Then recreate these contacts you see, one by one, by going into iCloud.com, your other iDevice or Outlook on your desktop and create them as new contacts. For best results I recommend that you DO NOT press save for the new contact until you FIRST press delete* on the non-iCloud contact you are about to make a copy of. Of course press delete only after you’ve copied all of the contact data.\n\n\n*\n\n*To delete a contact on your iPhone/iPad: Contacts> select the contact> tap Edit (top right corner)> Scroll to the bottom and select Delete Contact.     \n\n\nA: If you have more than one account with contacts, make sure your contacts are saved to your iCoud account and not any other (Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendar -> Contacts -> Default Account -> iCloud (or what ever you've named it). I use Gmail as main account, and therefore new contacts aren't added to my iCloud by default.\nIf you've done that and it still doesn't work, remove your iCloud account from you settings (Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendar -> iCloud (or what ever you've named it) -> Delete Account). Restart your phone and add it again and restart it once again.\nYour contacts, notes, events etc will NOT be deleted from your iCloud account, but any data NOT synced WILL (does not affect other account of course)!\n\nEdit: 2017-01-18 ~ With the advent of all the feature rich apps on your phone, you're likely to find that other apps besides the Contacts configured ones have access to add/modify your contacts, such as Facebook. This is why sometimes you have the same person show up multiple times on your phone, and not on your computer or other devices.\n\nA: I suggest you to try to reset your iCloud Documents.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://www.iCloud.com, sign in with your Apple ID. Click on\n\n*your name at upper-right corner > account settings Click Reset\n\n*Documents & Data Confirm reset\n(this will not erase anything, I just did it and it worked fine)\n\n*Restart your devices\nSee also : http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5824\n\nA: *\n\n*Got to Settings\n\n*Go to iCloud\n\n*Slide Contacts option to Off (You'll get a warning, make sure you choose to save the Contacts on your phone)\n\n*Close out of Settings\n\n*Wait 5 minutes or so\n\n*Go back to Settings / iCloud\n\n*Slide Contacts option to On (You'll get a message asking to merge Contacts, say yes)\n\n*Go to Settings / iCloud / Storage & Backup\n\n*Select Back Up Now\n\n\nA: I think most of the problem has to do with the fact that contacts can be saved in different groups.  If, by default, your iphone doesn't save contacts into your iCloud group it will not sync with Contacts on your Mac.  Therefore you need to configure your iPhone to save your new contacts to iCloud rather than another group (like Exchange).  Alternatively, you can configure Contacts to also sync with whatever alternative group is on your iPhone.\n\nA: It seems the default account under settings->contacts->Default account must be the iCloud account for the new contact to become an \"icloud\" contact. I cannot find a way to change group for an exisiting contact.\nIf the default acct as in my case was an exchange account it wont sync to icloud.\n\nA: I have an iPhone 5S and logged into icloud.com (via Windows) and couldn't see my updates from my phone. To resolve this, within icloud.com I selected icloud settings from the top right menu and Advanced > Data Security and select Sign out of all browsers. Once I logged back in online and on my phone the updates appeared. Genuis ;-) !!!\n\nA: If all of these answers aren't working for you, perhaps the contacts you've been wanting to transfer to your mac aren't in your iCloud account in the first place. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3515161 this thread fixed my problem, for my contacts were actually stored on the Hotmail-server.\n", "Q: Computer keeps crashing after I replaced the RAM I have an early 2010 MacBook Pro.

But I don't want to lose the game data stored locally, particularly Candy Crush. :) Is there a way to preserve data while upgrading?\n\nA: Make a backup and then restore the backup once the update has finished. \nA step by step guide is available here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4972, which states the following:\nTo update your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch from iOS 4 to iOS 5 or later, you must erase and restore your device first, before completing the update.\nAs part of the update and restore process, iTunes will (in order):\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up key elements of your device, such as settings, Contacts,\nCalendars, Notes, and your Camera Roll. iTunes will not, however,\nback up media content from your iOS device, such as music, apps,\nbooks, movies, and TV shows.\n\n*Update your device to the latest version of iOS software.\n\n*Restore your device from your most recent backup.\n\n*Restart your device.\n\n*Sync back media content from your iTunes Library to your device.\n\n\nA: make a back up then restore and use the backup to get all of your data back\n", "Q: How to make Rsync copy alias files? System specs:  2011 iMac, OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4\nI have come to understand that Rsync does not handle Mac Alises properly, and have now discovered that hundreds of aliases I've previously copied to my portable drive, are dead and useless because of this.\nIs there a way to force Rsync to handle aliases?  If the answer is a definitive \"no\", then how can I recursively batch convert all aliases in a directory to symlinks so that they will be handled by Rsync?  I've found references to an Applescript that would apparently do this, but the site hosting the script is long dead & gone.\nAs a last resort, does anyone know of something other than Rsync that would allow for incremental backups and also handle Aliases?\n\nA: Rsync can't look into the content of Alias files which would be needed to convert them. So if you want to have your backup be useable as is (without restoring it to the orignal drive) you will have to replace the Aliases with symlinks. \nThere is a solution for this on MacOSXHints.com.

My memory and CPU usage is fine and I have scanned for viruses countless of times an comes back with nothing. I have checked my spotlight search and apps running in the background (all the tips everyone gives you to check). If anyone has any suggestions it would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Here are some ideas for troubleshooting a slow Mac\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the console app (it is located in the utilities directory). Watch the log for any strange behavior.\n\n*Hold the shift key while booting to boot into safe mode, see if the issue continues. \n\n*Turn off half of the programs in the startup, see if issue persists, then turn off the other half.

That is... not an internet kiosk but a regular machine with no warning, notifications, popups, etc... removing all start up items, all notifications, putting an app on top and any other secondary tasks.\nThe idea is not only to keep an app on top of everything else (which is done by software) but tell the OS to not show ANY kind of warning/window/popup.\nThere's tools out there such as ecrisper and xstand but they're more oriented into letting a user browse online than telling the OS to be silent.\nSo far, my manual (no software) process is...\n\n\n*\n\n*Telling the software to stay on top of everything else\n\n*Go fullscreen\n\n*Removing startup items\n\n*Remove all notifications\n\n\nBut there's still system warnings (connection lost, secondary software crash, etc...). Any tips on this? Any software?\n\nA: If you can identify the sources of these pop-ups, you could write a script to automate your kiosk environment on new machines (I imagine the majority of the script would just be executing calls like 'defaults write com.apple...').\nTitanium's Onyx and Deeper have some pretty deep customising options, that would be my first point of call.\n", "Q: How do I run sudo command from standard account? From what I've read, it is good security approach to have two accounts, one admin and one standard.\nI am trying to run the following command in terminal on my standard account\nsudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle.bak killall SystemUIServer\n\nIt asks for a password at which point the process fails because the current user \"is not in the sudoers file.\"\nIs it asking for my admin account password or root password?  Do I have a root account/password if I haven't explicitly set one up? How do I temporarily elevate my access to execute the command without necessarily enabling root?\n\nA: The system is asking for the password of your account and then verifies whether you are allowed to run sudo based on the content of /etc/sudoers. By default only Administrators (which have the option ticket in Preferences) are allowed to do this.\nIn case you want to run shell commands with sudo without having to switch users all the time you have several options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ssh <any-admin-user>@localhost to log in as an admin user and run sudo then \n\n*Add your non-admin user to /etc/sudoers by logging in as an admin user, executing sudo visudo in Terminal, duplicating the %admin    ALL=(ALL) ALL line and replacing %admin with your username. This will allow you to use sudo in Terminal without giving you full admin access. Using visudo instead of editing the file directly will ensure that the file gets checked for syntactical correctness on save (an error in /etc/sudoers might lock you out of your system completely)\n\n\nA: I answered a similar question here\n\nSeems like you could use the SU command to switch to another user in Terminal. Once you've switched to the admin user you can use sudo commands coupled with the admin account's password.\nFor example, when I'm at one of my end user's Macs and I need to run something with elevated privileges (chown for example) without logging out and into the admin account (ladmin) I would use something like this (in bold):\nMr-Rabbits-Mac:~ notadminuser$ su ladmin\nThis will prompt for the ladmin account's password, once entered you will see a bash command prompt.  From here I can run any sudo commands desired, entering ladmin's password as needed...\nbash-3.2$ sudo chown user2 /some/folder\nThis will run the chown command using the now logged in ladmin user, prompting for the ladmin account's password.  Once finished you can type exit to return to your logged in user's prompt.\nScreenshot of similar process, only using sudo to run the ls command (just for example).\n\n\nA: Open Terminal and login to your administrator account. It should look like this:\nMyComputer:~ MyStandardAccount$ login MyAdminAccountName\nPassword: <enter password here> --The text you type will be invisible so no one can see the password\nMyComputer:~ MyAdminAccount$ sudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle.bak killall SystemUIServer\nPassword: <enter password here> --Text will be invisible again\nMyComputer:~ MyAdminAccount$ logout\nMyComputer:~ MyStandardAccount$\n\n", "Q: Replace \"Compress\" in Finder context menu with other compression app I've lost some sensitive data because the built-in compression utility generates corrupt files and doesn't show any error.\nAfter I compressed about 1 Gb of files with Finder's \"Compress\", I decided to delete the original data just to find that the file was corrupt and couldn't be extracted. This have happened to me acouple of times.\nIs there a way to change the default behavior to show errors during compressing or to replace zip from the compress contextual menu?\n\nA: BetterZip includes a service for compressing files:\n\nYou might also just use zip or tar from the command line:\nzip directory.zip directory\nCOPYFILE_DISABLE= tar -czf directory.tgz directory\n\nNote that zip currently removes extended attributes and ACLs.\n", "Q: Samba share randomly unable to move files/folders I'm having strange permissions issues with my OSX 10.8.4 server.

PDF-Reading has however only limited annotation support (notes in text and highlighting), while the ≈10€ Readdle PDF Expert should extend these abilities.\nHowever, I am slightly reluctant to purchase PDF Expert just yet, because I couldn't find out if the App integrates well with Documents; Since iOS usually doesn't give apps direct access to each other I fear, that syncing annotations made in PDF Expert back to Dropbox would require synching my pdfs to both apps -- aside from the obvious waste of space, this also brings the risk of file version conflicts.\nDocuments can send a PDF to Adobe Reader for annotating (quite powerful too), but it is then saved as a copy local to Adobe Reader with no way to move it back to Readdle directly. Worse yet, after doing so I have to versions of the same file; Such file duplications are one of the most annoying issues I have found with managing data on mobile devices; iOS just makes it especially common due to the (otherwise justified) high level of app-isolation. \nI fear that the same would apply to PDF Expert though PDF Expert should at least be able to use DropBox. \n\nA: The Documents app works very well together with the iPhone and iPad versions of PDF Expert (by the same company). You do need to go through the share dialog and you could use another tool such as PDF Pen Pro if you prefer or wanted a universal app for editing PDF that you locate and move using Documents app.\nSince iOS abstracts away the filesystem, unless you are careful to push changes back to a cloud storage location, you can get files duplicated, wrong versions and revisions. I don't think there is a silver bullet solution at this point for iOS file management other than using a single app that syncs directly to a shared folder.\nLuckily, PDF Expert does just that and works with a plethora of server backed storage options - Dropbox, WebDAV, Google Drive, FTP / SFTP, Office 365 / SkyDrive, Box, Oxygen and Huddle currently:\n\nEven better, you can set up sync to minimize the chance that you will forget to upload or download a changed document.\n\n\nA: With iOS 8, this has changed considerably. iOS 8 now allows for cross-app containers, allowing apps to share the same data container. This means that in iOS 8, you can add a document to one app and it is accessible in both places, without the need for the file to be copied. The apps work seamlessly and can both work on the same files as they are stored in a centralised location.\n", "Q: Mac Mini to Apple TV I know how to move YouTube and other material from my iPhone into the Apple TV. But, as I've just purchased a Mac Mini, I'm wondering, how can I move material from the Mac Mini into the Apple TV? \n\nA: You don't mention which AppleTV you own, so I am going to assume that it's the currently available model, or at least generation, because it's probably more likely, and its easier to answer :)\nThe answer it that you cannot move stuff onto the AppleTV, it's a streaming only solution.  Whilst it has a small amount of internal storage (I think 4Gb for the 1st version of the 2nd Gen model that I have) this is used to buffer streaming, particularly for movie rentals from iTunes etc.\nSo to simply view, rather than move, content that is held on your Mac Mini, or any device come to that, is to ensure that it is playable in a player that offers the chance to use AirPlay to wirelessly stream the content.  You'll need to be on the same LAN as the AppleTV to see the device, but assuming you are you should simply see it as an output source when you click the AirPlay symbol in the player.\n\nA: Your Apple TV doesn't have any significant storage; it is a stream only device. Other than YouTube, you didn't mention what content you're trying to \"move\", which I think you mean \"view\". You want to view content on your Apple TV regardless of whether then are on your phone or on your mini. \nYou have three options, assuming that your three devices are on the same network:\n\n\n*\n\n*Airplay. You can use Airplay from your phone and our mini to broadcast several types of content to your Apple TV.\n\n*iTunes. If you turn on your iTunes sharing (iTunes, preferences, Sharing) and tell tell your Apple TV to use that computer, you can stream any content you have on iTunes.\n\n*Apple TV Apps. There are a bunch of apps on your Apple TV, including YouTube and Netflix.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: How can I keep a macbook running when the display is closed? I bought a macbook pro retina 13\" few days ago. I have never had a mac before and I don't know where can I set the computer to keep running when I close the display.\nThe laptop came with os x 10.8.4.\nAny help?\n\nA: If you have an external display, then just closing the lid generally works.\nApple calls this \"closed clamshell\" mode or closed display mode.\nBut if you only have the macbook, and you want to be able to close the lid without sleep, for instance to move it from one class to another at school without having to use sleep etc, then it's more tricky.\nOne option it to enable internet sharing in Preferences, this requires the OS to stay running in case anyone wants to connect, but it does potentially leave you open to unwanted connections.\nAnother way is to run an app like NoSleep to do the hard work for you, it's free - check the link.\nBut there is no simple setting for doing this built into the OS.\n\nA: When not connected to charger it doesn't work when Display is connected, so make sure to have it plugged in while using external Display and working with closed macbook.\n\nA: I posted an answer over to the similar question:\nIs there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid?\nthat applies to this question as well.

When I log into my Apple ID on Apple's site here, https://selfsolve.apple.com/GetAgreements.do, I am able to view a complete list of all of my AppleCare registrations.  This is very convenient for organizational purposes.\nWe recently purchased about 20 or so MacBook Airs of a custom configuration from Apple, and they all came \"pre-registered.\"  Using Apple's MacBook lookup by serial number here, https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do, I am indeed able to see that the item itself is covered by AppleCare, but there appears to be no name or Apple ID associated with it.\nI want these pre-registered AppleCare registrations to appear under my Apple ID for all of my other registrations that didn't come pre-registered (which I needed to register by typing in the AppleCare registration number myself), so that both manually and automatically registered machines appear is one single unified list.\nAt the end of the day, everything that we need covered is covered.  I can see that these pre-registered machines are covered.  But how can I retroactively associate the AppleCare registration with an Apple ID of my choosing, or rather, how can I find out to whom the AppleCare is registered?\nYes, I understand that AppleCare is by serial number of the item and that we are covered.  But for our own record keeping purposes, it is 10000x easier to simply log in here https://selfsolve.apple.com/GetAgreements.do and see a nice, comprehensive list of all AppleCare agreements.  As it is now, we have a rift --- only ones we entered manually appear here.  The automatically \"pre-registered\" ones we have to track elsewhere (right now it's just going into our internal wiki).  But this rift, having two instances of the exact same type of information, is very inconvenient.\n\nA: Technically, AppleCare plans get registered individually to each equipment record in Apple's database. Similarly, a customer record gets registered to each equipment record and when you log in to Apple's web site, your customer record is polled to determine which equipment records should be presented to you. AppleCare transfers with the hardware, so registering it to a person (or com pay record) would be harder to implement and manage.\nYou can work through the process by following this guide:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to manage your AppleCare agreements - http://support.apple.com/kb/HE50\nMy experience is this isn't worth your time and that for 20+ machines, you'll want to keep internal records and not rely on Apple's externally facing registration portal. It allows anyone to register a Mac and if someone else mistypes their serial number (and types in your valid serial number), the registration presented at your account for tracking computers could lack that device. It's still covered and internally Apple knows who they sold it to no matter who tries to register that serial number and what Apple ID they use to do so. I just wouldn't want to trust that portal to keep my list in one place.\n\nApple has business teams in all retail stores and they might be your best way to get detailed instructions and assistance on how to correct any errors in registration and assist you in getting the AppleCare records straight if they don't match your records. The portal for end users doesn't have the tools to make it easy to manage large numbers of computers.\nYou will also want to look into a self-servicing account and although you might be a little shy of the 50 devices needed, I've seen many organizations set these accounts up with 20 to 30 macs on one order.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/programs/ssa/\nThat program has many benefits other than just the tools to bulk upload and manage AppleCare plans and registration but it's well worth it solely for the purpose you described above. The end user portal at https://selfsolve.apple.com is designed for consumers and ease of re-registering a used / unregistered Mac from a consumer standpoint - not a business that may have several purchases of 20 machines, some with and some without AppleCare so you'll want to look into software designed for business needs (like JAMF's Casper, Apple's JointVenture and SSA Program) and reach out to Apple's Business Staff to keep abreast to changes they may make to the tools going forward if it doesn't make sense to invest in tools like Casper, JV or SSA. \n", "Q: Are there configurable power profiles in Mountain Lion like in Windows? I started using a Mac few days ago (a MacBook Pro 13\" with Mountain Lion). I'm wondering if there are power profiles that I can create and set like in Windows. Do they exist in the Mac world?\n\nA: Something very similar but with some additional options exist.\nOpen your System Preferences and find the Energy Saver.\nOpen it, and the you can not only set your power profiles but few more helpful settings.\n\nHowever this does not set the Mac operating performances, since those are managed more intelligently based on actual demand. Means the system will go in to lowest possible power consumption mode when ever possible. That is best shown in the New MacBook Air, with a battery life of >8 hours.\n\nA: You might want to investigate the fine-grained control available to you in the Terminal command pmset. There is a host of features too numerous to mention in this simple posting.\n\nA: It's a great question, but because long-term OS X (macOS) users may not have experienced what Windows has to offer in this regard, I expect they are not sure what the OP is asking. Power Profiles allow for different power setting combination depending on the task. For example, when running a presentation a user might not what the screen saver to come on or the computer to go to sleep. Similarly, when encoding the user might not want the hard drives to power down. In Windows, seperate power profiles or themes can be set up for each of these occasions, allowing a range of power settings to be be controlled through making just one selection. So far I have seen nothing like this on the Mac (Mountain Lion to Sierra), so I am just starting my search to see if a third party utility exists. Failing that, there may be a way to set something similar up using the Automator. \n\nA: macOS unfortunately does not allow for fine-grained control over the power consumption of the computer. Still, there are some tools that provide some of the configurability offered by Windows' power profiles:\n\n\n*\n\n*caffeinate and KeepingYouAwake can prevent your Mac from sleeping.\n\n*Turbo Boost Switcher allows disabling Turbo Boost, limiting the clock frequency of the processor. This can limit power consumption (and fan noise) when a demanding application is being run (but will slow it down).\n\n*Volta allows for more fine-grained control over the power consumption of the processor. Your System Integrity Protection settings need to be adjusted, however.\n\n", "Q: Playing videos on VirtualBox Mac OS X guest on Ubuntu 13.04 as host I managed to install Mac OS X Moutain Lion as a VirtualBox guest OS on Ubuntu 13.04 as host.\nI need to test a web app which plays HTML5 videos on Safari 6.

Can anyone suggest an idea?\n\nA: OS X uses QE/CI (Quartz Extreme/Core Image) for graphics acceleration. Unless you're using an actual Mac or are running a modified version of OS X directly on PC hardware, you won't get full acceleration. Furthermore, VirtualBox support for OS X is experimental and doesn't include Guest Additions. \nLooking around a bit, it seems some have had success with modified SVGA drivers in VMWare. It may get you better performance overall, but it still won't enable QE/CI (and thus no video playback), and doesn't work with VirtualBox anyway.\n", "Q: Adding New Contacts but they Disappear When I add a contact from my keypad screen and save it the contact doesn't show up in my contacts list.

The original files DO STILL EXIST, but for some reason the aliases have lost their connection.  I would like to replace them all with symlinks, so that they can be backed up by Rsync.\nHere is a scaled-down example of a folder with broken aliases in it:\n\nNow here is an example of a sub-directory that contains both the originals of some of the broken aliases, as well as additional copies of the SAME alias, that still point to another location for their originals:\n\nAnd lastly, here is an image of a directory that contains the master files to some of the aliases that were located in both of the previous 2 locations:\n\nSo what I need to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify all aliases in a user-defined directory \n\n*Use the filenames of those aliases to locate their original files, in a second user-defined directory (recursively and ensuring not to identify a second alias as an original) \n\n*remove the alias\n\n*create a symlink to the original file, in the former location of the alias\n\n\nI'm using Automator wherever I can, and Applescript wherever I must.  Prior to the response that prompted these edits, my workflow did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prompt for the location to look for original files\n\n*Prompt for location to look for aliases\n\n*Get POSIX paths to all aliases\n\n*Get text filenames of all the aliases\n\n\nNow, it gets a bit further but with some problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had an alias titled \"3dfx & ambience.rfl\" (changed already in the screenshots to \"3dfx and ambience.rfl\").  The applescript provided would fail on that file due to the ampersand.\n\n*After fixing #1, the script ran and did indeed remove broken aliases and replace them with symlinks.  But the symlinks pointed to the parent folder that contained the originals, not the originals themselves.  So I ended up with 2 symlinks, \"Luftrum 1 - Thor Ambient.rfl\" and \"Luftrum 2 - Thor Ambient II.rfl\", that in reality pointed to the \"Luftrum\" folder shown in my third screenshot above.\n\n\nHopefully this will be enough detail to ultimately arrive at a working solution.  I can tell it's very close.\n\nA: Usually \"broken alias\" refers to an alias where the original file no longer exists. I have used this script to find aliases like that:\nset l to {}\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        alias files of entire contents of (POSIX file \"/Users/username\" as alias)\n        result as list\n    on error\n        return\n    end try\n    repeat with f in result\n        try\n            original item of contents of f\n        on error\n            --move contents of f to trash\n            set end of l to POSIX path of (f as text)\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend tell\nset text item delimiters to linefeed\nl as text\n\nIf the script finds the aliases you want to replace symlinks, save the relevant lines of the output to a text file. Then try running a shell script like this:\ncat /tmp/aliases.txt | while IFS= read -r f; do\n  original=$(find ~/directory/with/original/files -name \"${f##*/}\" | head -n1)\n  echo \"$f:$original\"\n  # rm \"$f\"; ln -s \"$original\" \"$f\"\ndone\n\n\nA: If you simply want to pass a file name to the Spotlight action\nThe pass the file name from an action to a set variable Action\n\n\n*\n\n*set the Spotlight Action to ignore the any above action.\nDone by right clicking on it's title bar and using the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*drag and drop the variable token into the search text field.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS AN UPDATE\nUsing Automator actions and Applescript to store properties for later retrieval:\nThe idea here is the first action writes out a applescript file to the documents folder.\nThe script will be used to store information we get along the way and then retrieve it later on in the final Applescript action.\nWe do this because we need to pass the final script multiple bits of information.

The Dock is a fundamental part of using OS X, however I have some frustrations with it:\nAs we know the Apps themselves are located on the left of the divide** separated from the \"stacks\" and trash can.\nWhenever I minimise an App window, it always minimises itself to the right section of the dock (where the trash can and \"stacks\" are located). However if I have several App windows open, the dock becomes very cluttered and full looking in appearance.\nIs there a way to minimise an App window such it becomes minimised into its own App icon on the dock rather than taking up space over on the right hand side and creating a clutter. Moreover once this has been achieved, in order to maximise the window again, you just click once on the App icon - hey presto - maximised. If i'm making sense ?\n** I don't know if there are official terms for the division of the dock into where the Apps are situated on the left, \"stacks\" and trash can on the right.\n\nA: I think you are looking for this feature:\n(System Preferences => Dock)\n\nI just tried it on my own system and it when you minimize, it minimizes on the icon. You can click the icon to make the minimized window appear again.\nYou didn't mention what version of OS X you are on; I'm on Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.4).\n\nA: @sameetandpotatoes Has the answer for the question, but for additional info that you are confused about then to understand why the Dock behaves like this you need to understand the differences between Modal and non Modal windows.  \nSome applications, for example the Preferences app, only ever have 1 window, and therefore it makes sense for them to minimise into their doc icon rather than create a secondary icon.  Often, for this type of app, closing the last window (i.e. the only window) also closes the app.  \nOthers, like Pages, are  not tied to a single window, but can have many document windows open, and therefore each get's it's own document icon in the dock (the simple way of thinking about the dock is that Apps go to the left of the divider, docs go to the right).  Closing a Pages window won't kill the app, even closing the last one won't kill the app, because it knows that you may want more.\nFor convenience, as per @sameetandpotatoes answer you can choose to stack your document icons on top of the relevant App icons, and this will make the doc more clutter free, at the expense of potentially taking a little longer to navigate between windows.\n", "Q: How big should my Time Machine backup drive be? My 13\" MacBook Pro has 500GB internal hard drive space, and I bought a 1TB external HDD to use as my Time Machine backup. I only read from many articles that the backup should be about 2 to 3 times the size of my hard drive, but I feel like 1TB will never be filled up, and in fact, leave a lot of free space.\nI understand that Time Machine takes a snapshot of my whole system and stores it in the backup drive. But say, for example, only about 120GB of my internal HDD is in use. Then it'll only take a snapshot that's about 120GB in size, and while that same snapshot will grow over time as I take more recent snapshots of my system, it will never go beyond 500GB because that's the maximum size of my internal HDD. Or do I have it wrong? How does Time Machine work, really?\nI'm asking this because I want to know if I should use a separate external HDD for storing my actual files.\n\nA: The size of your drive doesn't really matter, it's the size of your data.  If you are really only using 120Gb, then potentially an external drive of 240-360Gb could well be enough (until such time as you start to use more, obviously...)\nAs for how TM works, it doesn't  just snapshot the current state of your data, but it's historical changes.  This is why it can use more total space than the actual amount of used space on your drive.  Let's say that you have your 120Gb current system, and some months down the line you install OS X Mavericks when it's released - this may up your used space to (all figures are estimates!) 130Gb, but it's not just 10Gb worth of extra files, it might be 35Gb of changed files, and 5Gb of new files, resulting in a 40Gb change for Time Machine.  This way, when you restore, it's not just a case of being able to restore to the current most recent backup on your TM, but being able to go back in time to any point that it still covers and restore to that point, which may be as far back as prior to OS upgrades etc.\nNow, for more everyday changes, here's a good example of how you can consume a good amount of space in your backup drive without changing anything.  TM backs up at a file level. If a file changes, the new version is backed up in full.  Let's say you have a couple of films of a Gb each, but they are named incorrectly (either at a filename or META data level) - changing the title of the films doesn't really affect the space used on your machine, but it will result in both files being backed up again because they have changed.\n\nA: You probably want to check out this website for the most information, but here is the answer to your question, quoted from the website above:\n1. How big a drive do I need for Time Machine?\n\nA general \"rule of thumb\" is, to keep a reasonable \"depth\" of backups,\nTime Machine needs 2 to 4 times as much space as the data it's\nbacking-up (not necessarily the entire size of your internal HD).  Be\nsure to add the size of the data on any other drives/partitions you\nwant to back up.\nBut this varies greatly, depending on how you use your Mac.  If you\nfrequently add/update lots of large files, then even 5 times may not\nbe enough.  If you're a light user, you might be able to get 1.5 times\nto work, but that's subject to problems any time a large backup is\nneeded.\nAnd, of course, the larger the drive, the more old backups Time\nMachine can keep for you.  A drive that's too small may only have room\nfor a few weeks (or even days) of backups.\nUnfortunately, it's rather hard to predict, and most of us have a\ntendency to add more and more data to our systems over time, so if in\ndoubt, get a bigger one than you think you need now.\nAlso, there are some OSX features and 3rd-party applications that take\nup large amounts of backup space, for various reasons.  See question\n9  for details.\nThis is a trade-off between space and how long Time Machine can keep\nits backups, since it will, by design, eventually use all the space\navailable.  But it won't just quit backing-up when it runs out:  it\nstarts deleting the oldest backups so it can keep making new ones.\nThus, the more space it has, the longer it can keep your backups.\nIf your backup disk is on the small side, and Time Machine needs to do\na very large backup, either because you've added or changed a lot or\ndone something like an OSX update since the previous backup, you may\nget one of the messages in Troubleshooting item #C4  (which one\ndepends on exactly what happened, and which version of OSX you're on.)\n\nMy Answer\n\nThen it'll only take a snapshot that's about 120GB in size, and while that same snapshot will grow over time as I take more recent snapshots of my system, it will never go beyond 500GB because that's the maximum size of my internal HDD.\n\nNo, not quite. The 1 TB hard drive will be filled up because Time Machine keeps your backups and deletes them once your hard drive is filled. There is more than one backup stored on that hard drive. As stuffe pointed out as well, Time Machine allows you to restore to a previous backup, since Time Machine may keep 7 or 8 backups on that 1 TB hard drive.\n\nI'm asking this because I want to know if I should use a separate external HDD for storing my actual files.\n\nThat depends. If you need significant space for files that you don't need to have backed up (for example, if you are doing video editing and need multiple copies or edits of a video, and the source video is already backed up), then you should use a separate external HDD for those files that you can afford to lose.\nHowever, if you're asking about whether to store all of your files on an external drive, the downside is that you won't have two copies of those files (unless you use another drive to backup the external drive with your files on them), so if the external drive with your files fails, you will lose them all. The purpose of a backup drive is to have an extra copy of important files. Storing them only on the external drive means it's no longer a backup, just storage.\nHere is the quoted answer from 3 in the website I linked above:\n3. Can I use my Time Machine disk for other stuff?\n\nYes.  Time Machine will not delete anything you put there.  But it's\nnot a good idea to put anything else important on the same physical\ndrive, unless you back it up elsewhere.  When (not if) that drive\nfails, you risk losing it.\nIf you want to do this anyway, it's much, much better to partition an\nexternal drive into 2 (or more) parts, also called volumes.  Assign\none to Time Machine, for its exclusive use for backups;  use the other\npartition(s) however you want.  To use a new drive, or one you don't\nmind erasing, see question #5.  To add a partition to an existing\ndrive that already has data on it, see question #6.\n\n", "Q: Very strange partition table: Missing a sector between Main and Recovery partition So I have been trying to get Windows 7 on my machine using no DVD or USB (I have only an ISO to work with).

I use Time Machine to back up files.  I was having slow computing issues, so the Genius Bar folks recommended a wipe out and reinstall from scratch, but we decided not to back up the entire disk off of Time Machine for fear that it would only put back onto my computer that which made it run slowly.  I did full reinstall, reuploaded all software, a bunch of files I kept on an additional external drive, and now need to go retrieve a few files (not a full restore) from the Time Machine back up.  I see the purple tag mark for the precise date before I took the computer in, but the machine will not let me click on it to \"reveal\" that date's back up.\nAny ideas how I can get back to those files?\nThanks\n\nA: I would try Back-In-Time.\nYes it cost $30 but there is a demo and the couple of times I have needed to dig stubborn files out of a Time Machine backup it worked.\n", "Q: Shutdown from terminal without remembering open windows If I shutdown/reboot from Menu I get an option of saving state of open windows or not, but if I issue a command from terminal say shutdown -h now it will shutdown remembering all open windows, how can I shutdown without remembering any of the open windows just like the Menu option from terminal ?\n\nA: I am searching for a solution to the same problem. I have not found a nice solution although there is a hacky one here which in short is:\nDisable saving application state:\nrm -r '~/Library/Saved Application State/*'\nchmod -R a-w '~/Library/Saved Application State'\n\nDisable 'Reopen windows when logging back in':\ndefaults write com.apple.loginwindow TALLogoutSavesState -bool false\nchmod a-w ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\nsudo chown root ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist\n\nSee the provided link for more details.\nBut I really hope there is some better solution to this ? In my case the problem is that I have a mac in a server room that automatically runs a script in a terminal window. This machine can be rebooted remotely. But thus every time it reboots it keeps the old terminal window and opens a new one, so if I have rebooted it 10 times there will be 10 terminal windows open where only one is in use.\n\nA: I believe the keyboard shortcut controloptioncommandeject has the same effect.\nWhen you press all four keys the Mac starts the shutdown process, only prompting you to save documents/projects that have changes as their corresponding applications shut down.\n", "Q: OS X 10.8.4 not showing updates - how to fix?

The MacBook still shows \"transferring your information\".\nHow do I get my PC to pick up the MacBook again and continue the migrate from where it left off? Is that possible?\nif not, what is my next step?\n\nA: You will very likely need to delete the user on the Mac side and start the migration again. Depending on your setup, this might be a bad choice of steps, but most people run Migration Assistant as part of the first boot process, so I made the assumption that you also did that. Your next step might be to decide if you want to get help from Apple (they support all new Macs for free through AppleCare and the retail stores) or if you want to provide us with more details and see if we can guide you to how to reset things and start the migration over.\n", "Q: Photos not taken on any of our devices showing up on my Photo Stream Photos that were not taken on any of our devices are showing up on my Photo Stream.

We reported it stolen with AT&T, and erased it on the Find My iPhone app, so what else needs to be done so that we no longer get those photos?\n\nA: If your son had the FindMyPhone app installed,  you should be able to go to iCloud.com, log in and find and erase (wipe) the device. If it ahas been some time, contact information, personal details, credit card info are all at risk. I suggest getting him to change all risky numbers. Perhaps notify contacts to look out for spam/rubbish/malware etc.\n\nA: Change the password on your Apple ID (and it wouldn't hurt to change the email address used as the login name, either).

I've attached an Illustrator recreation of what the spots look like.\nDead Spot Image http://www.thoughtspacedesigns.com/images/deadspots.png\nThese spots don't seem to react to pressure on the screen at all, which would lead me to believe they've been there since I bought the thing, and weren't caused by pressure (just shooting in the dark though).  They really aren't all that noticeable, and again it took me til this point to even see a problem. I can't even see them in daylight conditions.  Regardless, the fact that I dumped over a grand on this computer and it's still under warranty makes me want to have this fixed.\nSo two questions stem from this:\n1) Is this a common issue with the unibody MBPs?  Is it a known issue with this model year or a certain make?\n2) Will this issue be recognized and covered by Apple under the standard one year manufacturer warranty?\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: 1) I haven't seen many reports of flat spots like this over the past few refreshes of the MacBook Pro so I wouldn't consider it a widespread or known issue.  Only Apple will know for sure, and if it is then they would likely consider a Repair Extension Program (REP) to handle repairs for these symptoms outside of the 1 year warranty.  Only time will tell.\n2) I would expect Apple to cover this so long as theres no signs of damage or trauma to the MacBook Pro.  AppleCare provides an extended warranty for failures and defects that are not a result of accidental damage. Ultimately it depends on the human being you end up dealing with but if I were you I wouldn't expect much pushback on having it repaired.\n", "Q: Can anyone tell me how I can change the Open With listing on a Mac?

That means that there are localized names for the application.  Localizations are stored in the app bundle in Contents/Resources.  Since I'm using English, I can look in /System/Library/CoreServices/NotificationCenter.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings, and see the name of the app with the space in it.\nStrings files are actually binary plists.

From my macbook I was using Safari, with other bookmarks and some day I tried iCloud, so my wife's iPad bookmarks were overwritten with my macbook's Safari bookmarks. I wonder whether there is some way to recover my wife's bookmarks before she kills me.\n\nA: The only way is to restore from a useful backup, if you have one.\nIf you sync the iPad to iTunes and use Time Machine regularly, you would likely have the appropriate backup to restore from. In that case:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Restore the iPad backup set from Time Machine from a date before you overwrote the bookmarks. The location of the backup is ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ (you can get to it by pressing Cmd+Shift+G in the Finder and entering this path).  \n\n*Connect the iPad, run iTunes and restore from the backup.  \nIf you use iCloud Backup, then you can restore from iCloud and choose which date's backup you'd like to restore from. You can check if you're using iCloud Backup by opening the Settings app on the iPad, then going to the iCloud submenu and looking at the status right below \"Storage & Backup\", where it would say \"iCloud Backup is off.\" (or \"iCloud Backup is on.\", as the case may be).\nIn any case, keep in mind that restoring from a backup means you lose all application data changes after the date of the backup.\nAlso see Restoring from a previous iCloud backup.\n", "Q: Is it safe to chown /opt/local? Is it safe (no security implications) to chown -R user /opt/local/, so that I don't sudo port install with MacPorts? \n\nI don't like the idea of sudoing with MacPorts as it can write things in /Library, for example, without my permission. I know I could use homebrew instead of MacPorts but I had problems with third-party software writing in /usr/local. I could also compile MacPorts with a custom prefix in my home directory but I guess that is the same with /opt/local/, as /opt/local/ is not a system directory.\n\nA: If you want to use a non-root MacPorts installation you will have to configure your installation to do that by installing from source and specifying --with-no-root-privileges as argument to ./configure. Note that you might have to set --prefix, too, if you want to do that.\nI would encourage you not to do that, for a couple of reasons, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directories listed in multiple users' $PATH that are writable without superuser privileges can be used for attacks (e.g., by placing a sudo binary that will log the password there). The same can be done by malicious software running as your user in order to get your password – although one might argue it's already too late when this happens.\n\n*MacPorts can not use privilege separation without root privileges. Normally, MacPorts will drop privileges to an unprivileged \"macports\" user while building software to avoid rogue Makefiles to wreak havoc (or even read files) in your $HOME.\n\n*MacPorts as of version 2.2 uses OS X sandboxing capabilities to prevent ports from installing files outside of the locations MacPorts encourages. These default locations are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/opt/local\n\n*/Applications/MacPorts\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\n*some locations necessary for some special ports to work, e.g., /usr/lib/pam for PAM modules.\n\n\n\nSo, in conclusion, I think a MacPorts installing using root privileges is actually safer and more secure than one not using them.\nDisclaimer: Since I'm a MacPorts Developer, I might be biased.\n \n\nA: This is safe up to the point where you choose to install anything inside /opt\nAt that point, it's more up to what programs you install there and what permissions and sticky bits you have set. In general, this is a fair tradeoff as long as you otherwise restrict access to the computer, but any time you let a user write directly to a place where programs will be stored, you risk privilege escalation and security issues if the programs can be exploited or have back doors or are just plain destructive due to their design.\n", "Q: How to prevent the dialog that shows the available wireless networks to show twice?

You need to launch the application within the appropriate user session. For security reasons, crossing the user session divide is difficult.\nYou need a process already running in the other user's session to listen to your request and launch the application on your behalf.\nlaunchd's bsexec\nThankfully, recent versions of launchd have this ability; although Apple engineers have not recommended its general use. Use the bsexec option in launchctl to target the appropriate user session:\n bslist [PID | ..] [-j]\n          This prints out Mach bootstrap services and their respective states. While the namespace\n          appears flat, it is in fact hierarchical, thus allowing for certain services to be only avail-\n          able to a subset of processes. The three states a service can be in are active (\"A\"), inactive\n          (\"I\") and on-demand (\"D\").\n\n          If [PID] is specified, print the Mach bootstrap services available to that PID. If [..] is\n          specified, print the Mach bootstrap services available in the parent of the current bootstrap.\n          Note that in Mac OS X v10.6, the per-user Mach bootstrap namespace is flat, so you will only\n          see a different set of services in a per-user bootstrap if you are in an explicitly-created\n          bootstrap subset.\n\n          If [-j] is specified, each service name will be followed by the name of the job which regis-\n          tered it.\n\n bsexec PID command [args]\n          This executes the given command in the same Mach bootstrap namespace hierachy as the given\n          PID.\n\n bstree [-j]\n          This prints a hierarchical view of the entire Mach bootstrap tree. If [-j] is specified, each\n          service name will be followed by the name of the job which registered it.  Requires root priv-\n          ileges.\n\nThe recommended approach is to write a launchd job ticket and restart the Mac - or ask the user to log-out and back in again.\nCause of the Problems\nThe problems stem from the application being connected to the wrong WindowServer process. Each user session has a separate WindowServer; this process handles the user interface. Your earlier methods place the ownership of the process with the right user but connected to your own WindowServer process.\nThis problem is mentioned in the Daemons and Agents technical note from Apple.\nExperience\nI know this from personal experience. For Power Manager, I wrote pmuser to exist within each user session. pmuser listens to our daemon and handles the per-user launches and commands. Despite our daemon having root authority, we still needed a per-user process to work reliably within user sessions.\n\nA: As finally 10.10 provides a correct \"launchctl bsexec\" implementation yo can use:\nsudo /bin/launchctl bsexec PID chroot -u UID -g GID / open /Applications/TextWrangler.app\n\nman says\n\nThis executes the given command in as similar an execution context as possible to the target PID.\n\nSo as PID param you can use the pid of the appropriate loginwindow process.\nThe UID is the user id of the user owns that loginwindow and the GID is it's primary group.\nThis works fine for any command and of course for launchd jobs (f.e. launchagents) also at last like:\n/bin/launchctl bsexec 104 chroot -u 501 -g 20 / /bin/launchctl load -S Aqua /Library/LaunchAgents/com.youragent.plist 2>&1\n\n\nA: You can use the Finder as the host for the right permissions osascript -e \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to open (\\\"${app}\\\" as POSIX file as alias)\".

Since then I've downloaded some music into my iPad's Dropbox app. I would like to move this from Dropbox to the Music app, but I'm not sure of a way to do it without my laptop. Any help would be great.\n\nA: The only ways to get music into Music.app is to sync with a computer, purchase from the App Store or use iTunes Match (which requires a computer to get set up). Unfortunately because of the way iOS is architected it is not possible to take music from third-party apps or websites and put them into Music.app.\n\nA: Basically, you'll need some computer to import the songs into iTunes. It doesn't have to be your computer, just one that can either sync the tracks to the device or get them into iTunes Match. Once you have the sync, you can delete your songs from that computer.\nYou can play the songs from Dropbox by streaming them locally using the dropbox app (or mobile safari if you save them to a shared folder) and it will cache the songs locally as long as you have room. But, it's not the same as having them in the music app which is sandboxed and can't see the dropbox files directly.\nThe only downside to syncing from a second computer is that you'll have to wipe the existing music or manage manual syncing until you have a computer again.\n\nA: I downloaded Tunebox, it was $4.99. It doesn't allow you add songs to \"Music\" but it does allow you to play songs from your Dropbox when your device is offline or in airplane mode. It works for what I needed. \n\nA: It is virtually impossible to take your music from dropbox into iTunes only using your iPad. If you use a computer and drag them from Dropbox into your iTunes then you can easily sync your iPad to your computer.\n\nA: You should be able to export the what you want by going to the Dropbox app and clicking on what you want and then clicking on the symbol that has the arrow pointing into the box. Just be sure and click the symbol with the arrow going into the box and not the one with the arrow out of the box\n\nA: i dont think its possible yet..... to get music on the music.app you will have to buy on the itunes.app or sync on the computer \n\nA: From Dropfile go into iFile for jailbroken phones and go into your Media folder into iTunes songs folder. Drop the song into this folder and your song will be added to Music.app.\n\nA: I downloaded \"eddy\" today. It works great. Select edit then choose which file from dropbox to download. Once they are downloaded you can play them back when offline.\n\nA: Transferring a music file from Dropbox to the iPad is possible. You need third-party software that uses music files natively in iPad for it's own purposes, such as Pinnacle Studio, for instance, which is a video editing software. Obviously this software needs to be able to store and access music files! I have this on my iPad. \nSo you open Dropbox. You play your music file. Press the AirDrop icon in the top right hand corner (iOS 7). The menu drops down. In mine a second row contains 2 icons, titled Copy Link and Open In.\nPress Open In. You get a brief window \"Exporting\". Then 3 software Icons, of which Pinnacle Studio and Evernote, and also DAW (sound software). Get the cheapest of the three! \nI press Pinnacle Studio (around $12.99) and voilà, it opens in the media library. I could not get it to open in DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and did not try Evernote.\nVoilà, case closed!\n\nA: You can also use the app, USB Disk. Again, tap, \"Open In\" in the Air Drop menu and choose USB Disk. You can play the songs there and upload to a computer later. At least you'll be able to clear your Dropbox space.\n\nA: For anybody who's still having this problem, there's an app called airmusic or something to that effect. Search \"dropbox music\" in the app store and it'll be the first result. It downloads the files and plays them.\n\nA: itis possible, you download the AirMusic app on your iphone or ipad, \nyou have the music in dropbox dont you ?  , go on Airmusic click import at the the bottom right, click the top right icon click , download selected or all items and it starts processing, after its processed you can delete the songs from dropbox and they will stay on air music \"dropbox music app\"\n\nA: Well, I think you can add them to music. What I have tried is opening a secondary device. I have been using a crappy tablet called a nook. The attachment is a photo of it. I think using a s contrary apple device and having your Apple ID and password the same than it should work via airdrop or mail.\n", "Q: Mac shuts down when trying to download software update I want to download the 10.6.8 combo update but every time I try it, my computer just shuts down. Does anybody know how to fix this problem? I am currently using 10.6. I had been using 10.6.8 but i tried to update it thinking that I was using 10.5.8. after installing the 10.6 I realized my mistake. I am using the combo update from Apple but just before that I tried updating my computer to Core Lion from Softonic because Core Lion doesn't exist in the apple store any more and my computer wont support Mountain lion. Now it wont even start up. \n\nA: Since your Mac doesn't start up anymore, try if you can do an upgrade install from an installation disk. See http://support.apple.com/kb/PH6606. It should keep user files and settings in place, but it often resolves issues like this. If you don't have backups, you can use Disk Utility to save a disk image of the drive to an external drive. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1553.\n10.6 doesn't have a recovery partition, so you will need to use the older tools for booting and fixing your startup problem. \n\nA: I tried starting it again later and it started. After I got it started I went to the Apple icon in the top left corner and instead of clicking on software updates I clicked on \"about this mac\" then I clicked on he software update under the information on which software I was running. It then updated without a problem..\n", "Q: External monitor not recognised- MacBookAir I have the same problem with my new MacBook Air (May 2013) as others have stated with MacBook Pro.

Oftentimes, I keep music playing and I want to change the volume while the display is off. Every time I increase or decrease the volume, the screen turns on, and I have to turn the display off again.\nIs there a way in ML to change the volume without waking the screen again? I know that it is supposed to wake the screen when the user presses something, but is there a way to maintain that functionality for everything but the volume buttons? If that's not possible, are there any third party apps that could do this?\n\nA: You can do this with a remote connection to your computer from another computer or phone. Using a Terminal app from your phone, for example, you can remote in and then run a command like:\n# Where 50 is a number from 0 to 100\nosascript -e 'set volume output volume 50'\n\nIf you did this a lot you could create an alias in your .bashrc (or other shell profile file) for a shorter easier command.\nI have a remote mouse app on my phone and it wakes up the screen, so you'd need a true remote control otherwise.\n", "Q: I need help deleting downloaded songs from iTunes using my iPhone 4? I'm trying to figure out how to delete these free songs I downloaded from iTunes using my iPhone? I downloaded them using my iPhone 4. So can I delete the same songs and how?\n\nA: In the Music app, find the song you want to delete in the list and swipe from left to right on the name of the song. Then tap the Delete button that appears.\n", "Q: Why there are two sleep modes? I am quite confused, I close the lid and then my mac book pro goes sleep and sometimes it seems to be in deep sleep and sometime it is not. I mean, sometimes when you open the lid, it will recover soon with a log-in window showing up quickly, sometimes it will show a white screen and a recovering progress bar at the bottom and then a few minutes later the log-in window.\nWhat's the theory behind this? How can I prevent it from going to deep sleep mode? Thanks\n\nA: The theory behind it is that it gets a lot more battery life when in deep sleep/hibernation than otherwise. Apple says after about an hour the computer should go into deep sleep.\nSee this question for further information and how to disable it. (The actual disabling instructions are in the question itself.)\n\nA: Also note that if you close the lid and you have a low battery charge that it may go low enough while closed that it stores the ram state to the HDD. This is so that when you reconnect to a power source and wake it up anything that you had opened will be restored as it was. This process takes time because you are basically reading 2-4 gigs worth of information back into the ram before it becomes stable enough to resume.\n", "Q: Rename terminal tab to host alias in ssh config I am new to using Mac (Mac Pro, OS X 10.8.4) and I connect to many remote hosts using ssh. I have created aliases in .ssh/config file and would like to have the host alias as the name of the tab in terminal.\nCan someone please advise on how it can be done?\nThanks much.\n\nA: EDIT: On Yosemite (OS X 10.10) use this instead:\nfunction ssh () \n{ \n     servername=$(echo $@ | sed -E 's|([- a-zA-Z0-9:/]+)( *[^@ ]*@)([^@ ]*)|\\3|')\n     echo -ne \"\\033]0;${servername}\\007\";\n     /usr/bin/ssh $@\n}\n\nNote that the function expects username and server name to be specified as user@server (you can use the server IP address too: user@a.b.c.d, the tab name will be set to a.b.c.d). Other combinations like -l user server won't work properly.\nYou can unset the function with:\nunset -f ssh\n\n\nYou can create a function named ssh that sets the terminal tab name and then invokes /usr/sbin/ssh:\nfunction ssh () \n{ \n    servername=$(echo $@ | sed 's|\\([- a-zA-Z0-9:/]\\+\\) *\\([^-]\\+@\\)*\\([-a-zA-Z0-9.]\\+\\)|\\3|' | awk '{print $1}');\n    echo -ne \"\\033]0;${servername}\\007\";\n    /usr/bin/ssh $@\n}\n\n\n\n*\n\n*servername=$(echo $@ ...\nThe first line extracts the server name from the arguments passed to ssh.

In fact, if it purports to have OS X on it, I would be suspicious.  I'm not sure Apple have ever supplied OS X on a separate drive.  \n\n*\"Old\" laptop Macs (before OS X Lion) were sold with an optical disc.

Insert the new drive in the MacBook and connect the old drive by using a USB SATA enclosure or some other way. Then start up from the old drive, reformat the new drive in Disk Utility, and clone the old drive to the new drive. See http://help.bombich.com/kb/usage-scenarios/i-want-to-clone-my-entire-hard-drive-to-a-new-hard-drive-or-a-new-machine.\nIf your Mac supports Internet Recovery mode, another option is to start up in Internet Recovery mode and restore a Time Machine backup on the new drive. If you haven't already, make a Time Machine backup of the old drive on an external drive. Then turn off the Mac, replace the old drive with the new drive, and turn the Mac on. After you select a network, the Mac will display a spinning globe icon and download a disk image of the recovery system from Apple's servers. From that point, I'm not sure if you can just restore the Time Machine backup or if you have to reformat the new drive in or install OS X first, but it should be relatively straightforward in any case.

I found that to get rid of this message I could either enter the correct password or simply click \"cancel\" twice.\nThis problem is documented here (I'm not the OP on these):\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2537287?start=0&tstart=0 and here:\nhttp://b.rthr.me/wp/?p=356\nAs one can imagine, this was very annoying and lead me to take action. I followed every piece of advice that I could (set date and time to automatic, reset Safari, try Chrome etc) and the problem still persisted. \nHowever, I read somewhere that if I opened Keychain Access and deleted everything (!) then it would kind of 'reset' itself and work as normal again. Reluctantly, I tried this. It did not work... it made things worse.\nThe Problems I Have Now \n\n\n*\n\n*Every webpage I go on, Safari brings down a notification saying \"Safari can't identify the identity of the website website-name-here.com\". If I click continue, I have to enter a password and the page loads (partially - see below). If I click cancel, the page will not load.\n\n*For some websites, some of the content is blocked. For example, on Google Maps, each and every 'map tile' just appears as a little blue square with a question mark in it. A question mark like this also appears, for example, where the 'user icon' should be (next to the username) of a user on this site (but not for every single user). This 'blocking effect' also means Netflix won't play anything that I've tried.\nAdditional Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm on a Macbook 3,1 (from 2007) with a broken superdrive and I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8.\n\n*It seems as if I can't even upload images to help describe the problem.

You can do it from an external SuperDrive or using another Mac that has a SuperDrive, with this one put in Target Disk Mode\n* Run Software Update to bring the system up-to-date\n* Use Migration Assistant (under the Applications->Utilities folder) to bring over your applications and data from the backup\nAlso see Reinstalling Mac OS X without a DVD Drive - Target Disk Mode\n\nA: You have only two options when the system keychain is corrupt, missing or tampered with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore that System keychain files from a backup source that you trust (this can be another Mac running the same or similar version of software or a backup from that other Mac or your backup.) Since the system files start out the same on all computers, the chance of a conflict or your storing special, changed keys in system is low.\n\n*Back up your current files (or the system) and try to reinstall the OS.\nThe implementation details of both steps 1 and 2 have several paths and many details, so once you've chosen one path, another question with exact details on your skill level and tools might be warranted.\nAnother way to state this would be to compare the the keychain to the timing instructions in a modern fuel-injected car. If you were to go in and delete the codes that tell when to open and close the valves and when to fire each spark plug, your car cannot run. It might run down hill (in neutral), and it might even start, but it's mostly or totally broken. Until you get those codes reloaded - the parts of your computer that need the system keychain will not work.\nAlso, this isn't a basic task - you may want to get someone that's reloaded a system keychain or handled an erase / reinstall / migrate parts of your data from the backup onto the clean system since you wouldn't want to have your files overwrite the good new system files with the broken ones you have now.\n", "Q: ram upgrade works in safe mode but not in normal mode I have new installed 8 gb ram in to my 2010 imac i3. \nIt kernel panic when booted, but worked when I start it in safe mode.\nIt also shows as 12 GB ram.

Would a similar program on Mac tell me similar data?\n\nA: You can use Mouse Rate which is written in java and therefore runs on OS X, Windows and Linux .\n\nThe source is on github.\n\nA: I work with \"TylerAndFriends\". We know that the average mouse is polled every 8-10ms, but you can buy \"gaming\" mice that are supposed to be polled more often (1-2ms). If you plug in one of these better mice, is there a way on OS X to check the actual polling rate of the mouse?\nFor example, I know you can do this on a PC by running the freeware program mouserate.exe by Oliver Tscherwitschke, http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Mouse-Rate-Checker.shtml\nIs there an equivalent or simple way to check the rate at which your USB device (i.e. mouse) is being polled besides assuming that the device is doing what it's supposed to be doing?\n\nA: There is a OS X  shareware App that can modify pooling rates for USB devices:\nhttp://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/Devices.html\n\nSupported devices:\nThe USB Overdrive works with any compliant input device so there's\n  really no way to list them all. In general, the USB Overdrive should\n  work with the following kinds of devices:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Mouse, Trackball, Trackpad and other pointing devices\n  \n*Gamepad, Joystick, Racing Wheel and other gaming devices\n  \n*External keyboards (built-in MacBook keyboards are not supported)\n  \n*Many multimedia controllers\n  \n*Many generic devices with compliant buttons and controls\n  \n\n", "Q: Limiting different users on a single machine to different connectivity I have a iMac running 10.6 where I have been tasked with creating two different users who can use different network profiles(locations). \nUser 1 will be connecting via Ethernet through a filtered network, all other connections are disabled, which works fine.\nUser 2 needs to connect to the unfiltered Wi-Fi but no access to any other connections.\nI have most of this implemented in Network Locations, the problem is that both of these locations are available to both Users.\nWhat I'd like to be able to do is assign the customized Location as a Default for each user. \nFrom a security standpoint it isn't perfect, but if I can get this sort of thing working, I'd like to assign the Wi-Fi connection to the guest user, so they can navigate without the filters. Then the Regular user will have Ethernet, and will not be able to switch Locations, or enable Wi-Fi.\nThe trick with this is that the User will be a single user. They will know both user passwords, they will just need to switch users to perform different tasks.\nIs it possible with plain OSX, or will I need external software/scripts?\n\nA: Well, I cracked it, it wasn't loginHooks I needed, but launchctl.\nBasically, create two scripts (executable of course, you can make em root only too):\nUser1.sh \n\n!/bin/bash   ifconfig en0 up; ifconfig en1\n  down;\n\nUser2.sh  \n\n!/bin/bash   ifconfig en1 up; ifconfig en0\n  down;\n\nThese of course make the assumption you're using an imac, en0 is the enthernet, en1 is the WiFi.\nThen create a plist file (with root ownership, 644), mine was this:\nUser1's went in /Users/user1/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user1.plist\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.user1.plist</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/user1/bin/User1.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nUser2's in /Users/user2/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user2.plist\n <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n    <plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>org.user2.plist</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/Users/user2/bin/User2.sh</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n    </plist>\n\nAfter that run\n\nsudo launchctl load -w\n  /Users/user1/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user1.plist\n\nand \n\nsudo launchctl load -w\n  /Users/user2/Library/LaunchAgents/org.user2.plist\n\nas each user.\nThat's it, it's quick, simple, and if you set the owner of the scripts as someone else (and on another path), it's fairly secure (not bulletproof, but that's not in my scope at the moment).\n", "Q: iPhone 4S cannot send messages I recently unlocked my iPhone 4S from AU KDDI to one of the carriers here in my country.

This resolution is used on notebooks with 11-15\" screens with elements size purposed for these small displays.\nWhen you enforce full HD (1920x1080), your TV will recalculate received data from your computer (1920x1080) to native resolution (1366x768), so elements retain their size as for full HD, but look bad (they are not native, just calculated, reduced for less resolution).  Although it is not visible on your screenshot, but I believe that view is wrong.\nUse smaller display with 1366x768, or native full HD display (will be still too big on 32\", i think).\n\nA: The only way to solve this is to get a TV with 1920x1080 resolution.\nWhat you are seeing in the top picture is the your Mac outputting to the native resolution of the TV - which is a resolution usually reserved for screens 11-13\" in size.\nWhat you are seeing in the image below is what happens when you show a 1920x1080 image scaled on a TV with only 1366x768 pixels.\nTo achieve the effect you desire, you need a TV with 1920x1080 pixels, and unfortunately that means getting a new TV.\n", "Q: Black screen after failed restore - G5 I tried to restore a G5, something went wrong and now I have this at startup:\ndyld: library not loaded: /usr/liblibconv.2.dylib\nReferenced from /bin/sh\nReason: Incompatible library version: sh requires version 7.0.0 or later, but      libiconv.2.dylibprovides version 5.0.0\n\nCan anyone help please?\nI don't have a Tiger cd as I was restoring using Disk Utility.

If I open the App Store, I can see the OS X Mountain Lion with a price and not \"installed\" or something like that. I don't want to pay for the OS that is already installed by default. Isn't there a way to download the image, an utility to create it or something like that?\n\nA: There was no DVD for Mountain Lion. Since Lion arrived with the App Store as a digital release, the core OS is not something you re-download from the store. You don't need to pay to re-download, but you do have to go through the Recovery HD to initiate the download.\nWhen you buy an upgrade from Snow Leopard to Lion or an upgrade to Mountain Lion - that installer can be re-downloaded, but when the OS is included with a CPU purchase, you don't need to have an Apple ID or account to re-download the OS. You just enter recovery mode and run the installer. It downloads the package after verifying eligibility by checking the serial number on the Mac hardware.\nIf you interrupt the process, you can grab the installer from the drive - but it's not something that the system was designed to deliver to you as a downloadable package. It was designed to download and re-install on an \"as-needed\" basis without needing an account, a password - just an internet connection and some time to wait for the download.\n", "Q: What could be causing my MacBook Air 13inch (Mid 2012) 2 GHz Intel Core i7 OS X 10.8.4 to throw the \"could not join\" WiFi error?

I am running OS X 10.6.8 and cannot upgrade to any newer OS to to hardware limitations.  I have used Time Machine to routinely back up this iMac.  \nI have inherited a newer iMac that has data on it from my deceased step father.  It is a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 memory and is also running 10.6.8.\nI would like to reset or reformat the newer iMac and then use my current iMac data that resides on the external hard drive to make the new iMac my very own, with all of my data files etc.  \nWhat steps do I need to follow? And where can I find directions or steps to follow? (I know that I must erase the existing old data that was not mine and then use Time Machine to load my personal information on the newer iMac.)\n\nA: There are a couple different approaches you can take.\nApproach 1 - Erase the newer iMac, reinstall 10.6.8 and use migration assistant to migrate your Time Machine data\nWith the newer iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert your Snow Leopard DVD (not the gray disc, a retail copy) and boot to it either by holding C while powering on or holding option while powering on and then selecting the 10.6 DVD.\n\n*Select \"Disk Utility\" from the Utilities menu in the Snow Leopard installer\n\n*Select the iMac's hard drive from the list on the left in Disk Utility, click on the \"Erase\" tab, type in a name for the hard drive (Macintosh HD?) and click erase.\n\n*Once the hard drive is erased you can close Disk Utility and proceed with the installation of 10.6, following the on screen prompts.\n\n*Once the installation is finished your newer iMac will boot to the normal welcome to OS X screen.\n\n*I believe the third or fourth step in setting up the newly installed 10.6 will ask you if you want to transfer information from an existing Mac.  Make sure your external Time Machine disk is connected and choose the \"From a Time Machine Backup\" option and follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n*Once the migration is finished you should be able to login with your normal user account and your data should appear to be just as it was the last time your old Mac backed up.\n\n\nApproach 2 - Clone your older iMac to the newer iMac\nThis requires that you have a firewire cable\nWith your older iMac:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Carbon Copy Cloner on your older iMac\n\n*Power on your newer iMac while holding T, you should eventually see the Firewire symbol (sort of looks like a Y) floating around it's screen\n\n*Connect the two Macs together via a firewire cable, your newer iMac should appear as an external disk on your older iMac's desktop\n\n*Open Disk Utility (/Applications/Utilities) on your older iMac\n\n*Select the newer iMac's hard drive (should be an orange icon) from the list on the left in Disk Utility, click on the \"Erase\" tab, type in a name for the hard drive (Macintosh HD?) and click erase.\n\n*Once the newer iMac's hard drive is erased you can open Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*Follow the on screen prompts in Carbon Copy Cloner to select your newer iMac's hard drive as the destination and then clone your older iMac's hard drive over to it.\n\n*Once Carbon Copy Cloner is finished you should be able to boot your newer iMac and browse through to see all of your older iMac's data now in place.\n\n\nHopefully one of those options works and you're able to get that data migrated with little to no pain.\n", "Q: Bought a used MB air- should I be worried about a root kit / keylogger? I ebayed a used Macbook. There is a new install of 10.8.3 on it. When I turned it on, it brought me through the user setup etc...\nWhat's the chance that the os install is corrupted with a root kit / keylogger? How would I check for that?\n\nA: I'm afraid there isn't a meaningful way we can tell you the probability that your system has a root kit and keylogger. The odds are certainly low, but not zero. Furthermore, if this is done well, it would be very difficult to detect.\nOne way could could check for this problem is if you use the computer to log into your bank account and then the money disappears and your identity gets stolen, perhaps it was infected. Obviously this is not the way you want to check.\nWhile the odds are very low, if there is a keylogger installed, the results could be very very bad. If this Macbook is from mid-2010 or later (check your model for compatibility before proceeding!), you can use Disk Utility to erase the recovery partition, then hold down ⌘R while booting to boot in Internet Recovery mode. This will cause the computer to connect to Apple's servers and re-download the operating system fresh.\n\nA: It probably isn’t since the new user setup was prompted. HOWEVER to be sure, format your hard drive and reinstall the OS, and you should be fine.\n", "Q: Turn iPhone into Dumb USB Drive I am looking to turn my iPhone into a standard USB drive that will work with any device that accepts USB (for instance plugging into a TV).

After a crash/reboot I lost all contacts on my iPhone. \nI have an iTunes backup, but it is several months old. The iPhone was set to sync with my Windows Contacts list, but it also appears to not have been modified for several months. iCloud wasn't ever enabled. \nHow can I get (most of) my contacts back onto my phone? \nA normal iTunes restores all data types at once, which means loosing all non-contacts data I added since the last backup. \nI tried an iPhone recovery tool without any success already (Wondershare Dr.Fone; it has many clones, published across several pseudo-\"how-to\" sites: Asoftech iPhone Data Recovery; Recovery-Android: \"Restore iPhone from Backup\" and \"Restore iPhone from Backup\"; iPhone-iPad Recovery). The tool found no contacts at all, although correctly displayed deleted items of all other types available on iPhone.\nIs it possible to either pull contacts only from iTunes backup file and restore those, or just sync my existing (although possibly out of date) contacts from Windows? Are there other tools which have chances to recover directly from iPhone storage, even if Dr.Fone failed? Any other ideas?\n\nA: I found how to make iTunes restore only contacts, while preserving the rest intact:\n\n\n*\n\n*run iTunes before connecting iPhone\n\n*disable auto-syncing in preferences: Edit > Preferences > Devices > Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically should be switched On\n\n*connect iPhone to PC. In iTunes:\n\n*on the Sidebar, select your iPhone (press Ctrl-S if Sidebar is hidden)\n\n*on the top central menu (Summary | Info | Apps | Music | ...), click Info\n\n*scroll the page to bottom, there's Advanced section\n\n*switch on: Replace information on this phone > Contacts\n\n*click Apply in the bottom right of iTunes window (or right click on iPhone and choose Sync)\n\n\nThese steps wipe the local contact store on iPhone (leaving cloud contact sync alone, if applicable) and injects all the contacts stored in the PC-side data source that iTunes has selected (from Windows Contacts in my case; Outlook on Windows / Contacts on Mac in other setups) and pushes those contacts to the device. It does not load contacts from an iOS backup.\n\nA: If you backup with iTunes and you restored from the backup and the notes were gone, then there is no where to retrieve them from unless you have another backup that contains those notes.\nLaunch iTunes on the computer and go to iTunes>Preferences>Devices. You will see a window with all of your backups listed in it.\nIf you see a recent backup that you are certain contains the notes that you need, recover deleted notes from iPhone backup.\nIf your note is gone from iCloud.com there is only a few ways to possibly recover it.\nThe first things I would check is a iCloud Backup, a iTunes Backup, or a 3rd party email that may have contained the note. To restore from a iCloud or iTunes backup follow this link. This article explains how to restore a device from either back up.\nNote if you have backed up since the note went missing, you will not have the note on the backup. Make sure you do not back up if trying to restore from a back up as this will back up the content without the note.\nTo get to the \"Set up assistant\" on an iOS device, you must go to Settings>General>Reset>Erase All Content and Settings.

It wacked my directory with a copy of the le file renamed as bin. This is a pretty vanilla machine just used a fileshare. Any thoughts on how to recover? Noticed there is no lost+found ... err, at least I didn't see it in root directory.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no way to recover from that, aside from restoring from a backup. Command line utilities don't have an undo command (and they don't typically delete to the Trash).\nlost+found wouldn't help either, since that is only used when a filesystem recovery utility has found filesystem corruption.\n\nA: What Brian said, you are in no return land.

I already have an Apple ID, made at Apple.com. Now, when I want to access the App Store from my iPad, I am told that I have to review my information. On the credit card page, I am not presented with a \"None\" option, even though I am in the United States. \nWhat can I do to proceed without entering this information?\n\nA: You need to do the following when at the Credit Card page\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Paypal \n\n*Click on 'To redeem a code, click here'\n\n\nFrom this new workflow, you will be able to get to the same page with the 'None' option\n\nA: You can't use an existing Apple ID and then enroll it into the store. \nThe \"none\" option only exists for new accounts as a one-time (or limited count) event for that device thanks to scammers and people that manipulate app store ratings with factory reviews and paid downloads.\nYou can usually make a brand new Apple ID following these steps:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204034\nIt's generally a bigger pain to have two Apple ID, so I would encourage you to not set up a new ID just to avoid the temporary delay of getting a legitimate address and card for temporary use.\nOnce you have your account verified, you can use store credit for just about everything on the store. \n\nA: go to your account in iTunes and then sign out, still beeing signed out, \"purchase\" a free app in iTunes youll then be promted to sign in, do so and then head over to your account and billing information the \"none\" option has now have appeared, choose it and save your information. and you are all done...\nIF that doesnt work try this check your purchase history for any unpaid bills, rather outstanding balance.

I'm unable to do anything. Any ideas on what would cause this?\n \n\nA: That screen indicates a likely graphics card or video RAM (GPU/VRAM) failure and not a software failure. These parts are one with the logic board, so it could also be the CPU. In any event, as long as you seek Apple for repair and the mac is less than 5 years old, it might be as little as $350 to fix if it needs a repair.\nYou will want to back things up and see what your convenient repair options are by browsing http://locate.apple.com\nIf you can't get help soon or economically, edit in your Mac model year and software level (Lion, etc...)\n and we can start with some troubleshooting steps. \n\nA: Try Option-Command-P-R to Reset PRAM settings.

I know plenty of companies do it but I can't find a solution that either isn't a Hotel level enterprise product or a hack to a existing router.  Any ideas?\n\nA: You could do it with LinSpot. They take a 15% cut of for-pay access. You can install their software on your Mac. http://www.linspot.com/\nAs for doing it yourself, it's a bit trickier. You'd have to run your own DNS server, so when a user connects to your network, the first request would be redirected to your splash page. Then all subsequent DNS requests would pass through your server to a real DNS server. That type of policy may be possible with OSX Server or iDNS server, but I'm not 100% sure on how it's done. You will need server administration software, and you will need capture the DNS to create your own Captive Portal (as it's called). \n", "Q: Opening Xcode on Mac I am new to Mac as well as Xcode.

The iPad basically can't find the (source) wifi if it's like 5-7 meters away. I'm sure the (source) wifi has no problems because everyone else's iPads are working fine with that public wifi. \nI've tested that the iPad is still functioning by creating a wifi hotspot with a MacBook.\nWhat else can I do to diagnose the problem?\n\nA: I would ask if you can definitely link the introduction of the poor signal to the time immediately after installing the upgrade.  They may be linked, they may not.  If you think there is a link, then I would advise backing up the iPad, and reapplying the OS update via a full restore, thus essentially imaging the entire OS from scratch rather than relying on the OTA upgrade from 6.1.2.\nAfter a re-image, then to rule out any configuration issues, try to connect to the WiFi source without restoring your data.  If it works, then perform a restore and check again.  If it's still not working, then my hunch is that maybe you have accidentally caused the wifi antenna connection to disconnect internally - serious question, can you identify any faint rattle type noise if you shake it, particularly in the bottom right where the cable connects.\n", "Q: Shell script to determine the file size in a folder recursively Can anyone provide me with a shell script that I can run against various folders to see where large files are lurking?\nMany thanks\n\nA: find . -exec du -h {}\\;\n\nis recursive and displays the size in human readable form.\nOr if you're using fish or zsh:\ndu -h ./**/*\n\n\nA: You can just run\ndu -sm * \n\nto see the size of all folders in the current directory. \n\nA: Or, as an alternative, you could install the freeware Disk Inventory X. Shows you the largest files on your hard drive or in particular directories with a fun visual interface. And you can move items to the trash right from that interface.\n\nA: You can also use tree --du -h .. --du calculates the size of the contents of directories (like du) and -h uses human-readable file sizes.\nOr if you only want to see the sizes of the contents of directories, use just du or du -h. You can use gsort -h to sort the output of du -h.\nYou can install tree and gsort with brew install tree sortutils.\n", "Q: Scrobble iTunes Radio With the release of iOS7 and new OSX people will use iTunes Radio more and more.

I am using a 2012 MacBook Air with a 128GB SSD and I've had problems before with inaccurate free disk space (even when accounting for Time Machine's Local Snapshots). Usually though I can fix the problem by verifying the disk in disk utility, which then shows Invalid volume free block count and orphaned blocks errors, which I could then repair in recovery mode, but now disk utility repeatedly insists the volume is OK, and its S.M.A.R.T. status is verified.\nI suppose I will have to just reformat the drive, reinstall OS X and restore from my backups, but is there anything else I can try first? Also, since this has happened a few times before (mainly when I delete a large amount of space in one go), should I suspect the SSD of having problems, in spite of its verified S.M.A.R.T. status?\nUPDATE: I initially thought there was a 26.2 GB discrepancy. Interestingly though, whilst System Information reports that backups are taking up 12.65 GB, sudo du -csh /.MobileBackups gives 31 GB. In total, this adds up to 94 GB of used space, which still amounts to a 7 GB discrepancy which I can't account for.\n\nA: Ok, so after posting this question I had some major breakthroughs, most of which are posted in the update to my question. By then remembering that du still reports in units of 1024 whilst OS X now uses 1000, the final 7 GB was accounted for (well, there's still a potential 500 MB missing judging by Disk Utility, but that's probably just an artefact of du counting in blocks). Now the only question left is why System Information is reporting a substantially lower value for Backups than it should be, and whether or not it will remember to eventually clean up the other 18 GB of local snapshots.\n\nA: Try using Grand Perspective to see exactly what's on your disk. \nhttp://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: Macbook Air OS X 10.8.4 Trackpad Pinch Zoom not working in Firefox 23.0.1 I recently updated my OS X to 10.8.4 and updated Firefox to 23.0.1\nNow the pinch zoom feature on my trackpad does not work. It works fine in Safari. Will appreciate any suggestions to solve this problem.\n\nA: You can restore the zoom feature by changing the values of the related prefs on the about:config page.\nbrowser.gesture.pinch.in -> cmd_fullZoomReduce\nbrowser.gesture.pinch.in.shift -> cmd_fullZoomReset\nbrowser.gesture.pinch.out -> cmd_fullZoomEnlarge\nbrowser.gesture.pinch.out.shift -> cmd_fullZoomReset\nbrowser.gesture.pinch.latched -> false \n\n\nA: Well, the specious answer would be \"Use Safari\", but that's clearly not very helpful.\nI doubt very much that the OS update you mention made a difference, although for peace of mind you might like to step your upgrade to see where the fault was introduced.  If you can revert to your previous version of Firefox whilst keeping on 10.8.4 and see if that still works, then you'll know the problem is localised to the new Firefox version.\n", "Q: iCal iPhone change Exchange calendar color First of all I want ask you how I can change my Exchange Calendar colors to a non-default color.\nIf I click Calendars in iCal on my iPhone, I get a list of all Calendars.

Most advice on the Apple forums ranges from resetting the Time Machine backup to replacing the NAS device. Since the manual backup succeeds, that would seem to indicate some issue with the NAS mount. The manual backups seem to both mount and unmount the NAS device (or so says the logs), but the automatic backups do not appear to do the same thing.\nI tried adding the mount of the NAS device to my user's \"Login Items\" and re-establishing the mount, but that does not appear to resolve the issue, either.\nIf I right-click the Time Machine icon in the top menu and select \"Back Up Now\", I get an error that the backup disk is not available. However, I can immediately go into the preference pane as described earlier and invoke a successful backup there.\nWhat's causing my automatic backups to fail?\n\nA: Not a real answer, more a workaround to have your backups automatically despite this bug. That worked for me (see this answer of my own question).\nOpen a command line and say tmutil destinationinfo. Copy the ID you see in the ID line (a long suite of alphanumerical characters and -'s).\nNow type tmutil startbackup -d TheID replacing TheID by the ID you just noted before (so something like tmutil startbackup -d 11326F32-D5BA-4FE8-83FB-E9CBD8F6FF2D but with an other ID). Open Time Machine Preferences and check if the backup is running. You may have to wait a few seconds before you see anything.\nIf that works, you can add it to your crontab so it is automatically run manually every hour (sounds contradictory?). Type crontab -e on the command line to edit your cron jobs, and add the following line in it:\n0 * * * * tmutil startbackup -d TheID\n\nagain replacing TheID by the ID of your backup. Next hour check if anything is happening. You can replace the leading 0 by the minute you want it to be run.\n", "Q: How can I backup an Application in the applications folder? I was wondering what will happen if I copy the content of an application in the applications folder, compress it and move it to another hard drive. Will it work if I put it in the Application's folder again, uncompressed? Will it work in other macs?\nEDIT: Ok. Now I understand there are at least two kind of applications; One kind uses an installer and the other simply a copy mechanism. \nThe second kind can be backed up my copy the Application.App. But, for the former one, how can I get a backup for Photoshop and stuff like that?\n\nA: Generally, yes, since most applications are installed through copying the application from a DMG file into your Applications folder. However, this is not always the case, since applications can also be installed through the use of OS X Installer or a 3rd party installer.\nAs a rule of thumb, if an application was installed through an installer, copying the .app from the Applications folder won't be enough.\nIf you wish to backup an application that came from an installer, you will usually require that installer. If you have a valid license for the software (e.g. Photoshop) you can redownload the installer from Adobe's website and use that to install it.\nWhen you entered your key into the application, it will have created a hardware-linked key that ensures the software cannot be copied to a new computer without re-entering the software key. The easiest way is just to use the installer itself to reinstall the software.\nIn addition, don't forget about the additional files that may be created when you run the application. For example, files in the Application Support folder. You can use an complete app remover such as AppCleaner to list the files that may be related to the app.\n                            \nIn this case, there was a .plist preference file in ~/Library/Preferences that holds DaisyDisk's user preferences. Copying this file to a different computer in the same place should keep the preferences.\nOn the other hand, cache files such as those in ~/Caches are not usually necessary to be backed-up/copied.\n\nA: It could work, but not in all cases. Some applications store data like preferences or license keys on another location. Especially applications that were installed using a installer rather than drag and drop.\nSo for some apps you lose preferences for the application when you copy it that way and run it on another computer, so it's like you open the application for the first time. And some applications won't work at all on another computer, because essential data is missing.\n\nA better way to create backups that will definitely work is by using Time Machine.\n\nA: You need to copy the content of both the applications and application support folders. This can be done by drag and drop or via terminal command prompt.

That's why I want certain accounts (the work related ones, not my personal ones) to go offline after working hours. My mail accounts are configured in Apple mail.app under the same user account.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: Couldn't you just set Mail.app to check only specific accounts, then re-enable them when you want to check them? In the Advanced options under Accounts, you can uncheck the box to Include when automatically checking for new messages. If this box is unchecked, this account will be ignored when Mail.app checks for new email. \n\nThe checking/unchecking of this box can be scripted using AppleScript.\ntell application \"Mail\"\n   set enabled of account \"NameOfAccount\" to false\nend tell\n\nThis script can then be tied to a macro in an application such as Keyboard Maestro.\n\nA: Try my script.

Can that be done either in a startup script or, better yet, configured within Terminal itself?\n\nA: You can try this.\nYou can use the Terminal Profiles to give each tab its own profile.\nThis way, you can set the shell command for each tab individually.\nAnd you can save the window group (tabs) so they will open on Terminal launch.\nExample of set up\nSet up your tabs in a window, i.e., cd to the directories in each tab as desired.\nThen, go to the Terminal Preferences and to  Settings Tab menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the Basic Profile.\n\n*Click the + button at the bottom. This will duplicate the profile.\n\n*Name the new profile (for example, home).\n\n\nRepeat steps 1 - 3 as many times as the number of tabs, and name each of them with unique names.\nIn my example, I will have 'home' and 'work'.\nNow, for my 'home' profile, I will:\n\n\n*Select the Shell tab.\n\n*Check 'Run command'.\n\n*Set the command string to  cd ~\n\n*Check 'Run inside shell'.\nFor each profile, I will repeat steps 5 - 7, changing the cd command accordingly.\n\nIn my tab named 'Home Dir', I will:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + click on the window to get the contextual menu, and select 'Show inspector'.\n\n*Select the 'settings' tab\n\n*Set its profile to the 'home' profile.\n\n\nFor each tab, I will repeat steps 1 - 3, changing the profile accordingly.\nNow, my Home tab's profile should be the 'home' profile and my tab named 'Work Dir'  profile should be the 'work' profile.\n\nNow using the Windows Menu \"Save Windows As Group\".\nCheck the checkbox  - \"Use window group when Terminal starts\".\n\nI have tested it as best I can and this set up works.\nEach tab opens in the cd's to its own directory.

I have been sent an invitation to join another user's calendar.  I have previously been sent calendars by this person and have had to view the source code of the e-mail where I found a URL that I pasted into Calendar's File:New Calendar Subscription box.  However, unlike previous times, when I try to subscribe I get an error saying:\nThere was an error subscribing to the calendar.\n\nThe data downloaded from https://www.icloud.com/calendar/share/#... isn't valid.\n\nI have noticed that the previous calendars that I subscribed to had a slightly different e-mail text (\"Subscribe to my calendar... You've been invited to an iCloud calendar\" vs. \"Join XXX calendar?

I tried replacing https:// with webcal:// to no avail.\nI don't understand the part about an Apple ID and iCloud.  I've got a Mac and an Apple ID (why does it want to share that with everyone else anyway?), but I don't have iCloud. I do have Calendar which is where all my other subscribed calendars are, so why can't I just subscribe to this calendar just like all the previous calendars they sent me?  I'm already subscribed to all their other calendars so it sounds like it would be a big pain if I have to go some place completely different just to see this new calendar.\nUpdate:\nThe person who sent me the invitation said they have no idea what they did differently this time, so if anyone could shed light on that instead so they could simply re-send the invitation in a way that I could subscribe that would be an acceptable alternative.\n\nA: The issue is that the calendar needs to be made public.  This does not mean that anybody can see your calendar, just that anybody can subscribe to it if they have the URL you send to them inviting them to subscribe.  Calendar does not appear to have the ability to subscribe to a non-public calendar, since you don't have to enter your Apple ID to use it, and iCloud uses this to authenticate that you are authorized to view a private calendar.\n", "Q: Set a keyboard shortcut to clear all tracks from the Up Next queue in iTunes I am looking for a way to assign a keyboard shortcut to clear all the tracks from  Up Next queue of iTunes.

My solution simply listens for a trigger keystroke when iTunes is active and then fires a sequence of other keystrokes that presses the “Clear” button using only the keyboard.\nThe instructions below set this up using the paid app Keyboard Maestro, but you should be able to replicate this using any other app that can listen to a keystroke and then fire other keystrokes. Quicksilver, Automator, or AppleScript could be used in alternative solutions.\nIn Keyboard Maestro, first, create a folder “iTunes-specific mapping” with this configuration:\n\nAvailable in these applications:\n\n*\n\n*iTunes\n\n\nThen add a macro called Clear “Up Next” and set a trigger hot key:\n\nTriggered by any of the following (when iTunes is at front):\n\n*\n\n*This hot key:\n\n*\n\n*⌘' is pressed\n\n\n\nWill execute the following actions:\n\nClick “+” to add an action, search for the “Type a Keystroke” action, and add five copies of it to the list of actions.

You can fix the first problem by changing the sent keystrokes, and you can fix the second problem by adding Pause actions between the keystrokes.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup over WiFi Causes Erratic Magic Trackpad Behavior My Setup\nI have a mid-2010 13\" MacBook Pro running OSX 10.4.8.\nTimeMachine is configured to run hourly backups over WiFi to a TimeCapsule.\nI also have a Magic Trackpad linked to my computer via Bluetooth.\nThe Problem\nWhen TimeMachine begins its backup, if my computer is not connected via ethernet (WiFi connection only), the cursor controlled by the Magic Trackpad moves erratically to the point of being unusable for the duration of the backup.

Windows user switching over to Mac here.\nI have downloaded an application, the link to which is currently on my desktop. It is actually a *.app file, which I'm assuming is a shortcut to the file? I want to get the shortcut onto the tray of icons at the bottom of the screen. I'm familiar with linux/unix. Is there a way to mv the file from the desktop where it is to the tray of icons at the bottom? I'm not sure what the path is. \nPreviously, I tried dragging it onto the tray, then deleting it from the desktop, but when I tried to then run it from the tray, it said it was in the trash.\n\nA: Firstly, @cyphorious has the answer you need, but I'm going to add more details to help expand your understanding of Mac terms.\nFirstly, the .app file that is on your desktop is the actual application, not a link.  Think of a .app as being roughly equivalent to a .exe (the main difference being that a Windows .exe file is a single file that will no doubt require a bunch of DLLs and other supporting files that it will expect to find either in your windows/system32 folder, or in the same location as the .exe itself.  A .app looks like a single file, but is actually a collection of files and folders that is just treated differently so an app can be identified and moved/copied/deleted as a single file, rather than having to know which files and folders combined make it up - it's essentially a bit like a zip file that doesn't need unzipping to access the contents).\nThe tray of icons at the bottom is the dock.  Nothing lives in the dock permanently, anything there should be a shortcut or link to the actual file that is expected to reside elsewhere.  In this way, when you remove an app from the dock, you are just removing the shortcut, not deleting the actual app.\nSo the key to getting the shortcut working in the dock is to move the application to where you want it, then either start it and tell it to stay in the dock, or drag it to the dock from its new permanent location (usually the applications folder as per @cyphorious's answer, but could be on an external disk etc).\n\nA: In OS X to \"properly\" install an application, just take the .app file a drag in into your applications folder using the Finder (due to localization the Application folder in the Screenshot is named Program..., but the icon is the same)\n\nWhen you then launch the application it will appear in the dock (the \"tray of icons\"). Right click the icon and and choose \"Options\" -> \"Keep in dock\" and it will stay there for quick launching. You can also move it around in the dock if you want to have it in another spot.\n\nA: I would like to add one clarification to @stuffe's excellent expansion on @cyphorious's answer. This is something I see happen a lot, both on long-time Mac users and adopters who come over from other systems. \n@stuffe states: \"Nothing lives in the dock permanently, anything there should be a shortcut or link to the actual file that is expected to reside elsewhere.\"\nThis is correct, but I just want to point out that you don't have to make a shortcut to the file and then drag it to the dock. The icons in the dock are by their very nature shortcuts. And I know that @stuffe didn't say that you had to make a shortcut, but like I said people do this a lot, when they hear that the icons in the dock are shortcuts. \nMac uses this strategy a lot. The same goes for icons in your sidebar, and on the task bar. And numerous other applications on your Mac.\nExample: in iPhoto, only the photos in the Library are the true photos, and therefore can be truly deleted. Photos put into albums appear like the real photo, but really the albums are just an organizational method. Deleting the photos out of the albums does not delete the photos, it just deletes their organizational reference, or shortcut, within the album.\n", "Q: What have more performance, a virtualized Boot Camp partion or a virtual hard drive? I need to virtualize some Windows applications (I will use Parallels Desktop or VMWare Fusion). I have to options:\n\n\n*\n\n*To install Windows in a partition using Boot Camp and virtualize this\npartition from Mac OS.\n\n*To create a virtual hard drive, install\nWindows in it, and virtualize it from Mac OS.\n\n\nI know that if I proceed with the first option, I will be able to boot into Windows if I want, and the changes made will be bidirectional.\nBut, my question is: What method offers more performance, virtualize a Boot Camp partion or virtualize a virtual hard drive? I don't think, I will need to natively boot Windows. So, that is not an advantage for me.\nEDIT: Ok, I did some tests and I can tell you a virtual hard drive feels way faster than a bootcamp partition. So if you really don't care about natively booting Windows, create a virtual hard drive. Besides speed, you will gain the very handy suspend and wake from suspend capability.\n\nA: As I state above and based on my own tests, running Windows in a virtual hard drive is faster than doing it from the Boot Camp partition.\n\nA: Bootcamp will offer better performance, although it's questionable if you'd notice the difference.  \nHere's one reason why this would be true:\n* Bootcamp has its own partition and filesystem (usually NTFS). There is a small translation overhead that OS X has to do to access the Bootcamp partition (which is an MBR partition sitting inside the main GPT partition layout for the Mac).\n* In the case of a virtualized hard drive within OS X, you'd have an NTFS file system (for Windows) sitting on top of an HFS+ file system (used by your  Mac). HFS+ is kind of primitive in design, and one of the limitations is a \"global lock on the file system for file system metadata structures\", which restricts file system access to one process at a time. This means the applications running on OS X would add to the overhead of Windows (and its programs) accessing the filesystem, creating a higher contention for the drive.\n", "Q: Why the command line does not respect the PATH order on OS X? I added an ssh command inside ~/bin/ssh and modified the PATH to include it, before other paths.\nWhen I do run which ssh it will respond with ~/bin/ssh but when I do run ssh it will just execute the /usr/bin/ssh instead.\nI have no aliases for ssh.\nWhat's the reason and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Do not use which, use type. The which command in the default shell (bash) is an external utility which doesn't know about aliases and functions. On the other hand, type is an internal utility which will tell you whether its argument is an alias, a function, a built-in utility or an external command.\nThe which command is mentioned in tutorials and manuals only for historical reasons — 30 years ago the type command didn't exist everywhere, and some people have been slow to adapt.\nFor more details, including a discussion of historical and current shells, see Why not use “which”? What to use then?\n$ type cp\ncp is aliased to `cp -i'\n$ type mkcd\nmkcd is a function\nmkcd ()\n{\n…\n}\n$ type type\ntype is a shell builtin\n$ type cat\ncat is /bin/cat\n\nIn zsh, it's ok to use which: zsh has both type and which as built-in commands.\nAlso note that if you just installed or removed a program, the shell may have memorized its old location. For example, if you just installed your own version of a program in a directory that is ahead of the system directories in $PATH, the shell may keep invoking the program that came with the system. This is only an issue in shells that were already running at the time of the installation or removal. To refresh the shell's memory with current data, run the command hash -r or hash COMMANDNAME.\n\nA: Mistety solved, I had a function in bash_profile with this name...\nFound it using: set |grep ssh\n", "Q: List of all packages installed using Homebrew Is it possible to and how do I get a list of all the packages installed on my Mac using Homebrew? I am not interested in packages installed outside of Homebrew.\n\nA: Executing brew list command shows a simple, alphabetically  sorted list of all the installed packages.\nHowever, various required packages (dependencies) get automatically installed when installing a package using Homebrew. It is possible to view the list of all the installed packages as a nicely formatted dependency tree. To view it, execute the following command:\nbrew deps --tree --installed\nAn example output is as shown below:\ngdbm\n\nopenssl\n\npython\n├── gdbm\n├── openssl\n├── readline\n├── sqlite\n│   └── readline\n└── xz\n\nreadline\n\nsqlite\n└── readline\n\nxz\n\nThe independently listed packages (e.g. gdbm and openssl in the example output above) have no dependencies. The packages depicted as part of a tree structure have their dependency listed at immediate lower level (e.g. package sqlite requires that the package readline to be installed). The packages listed at leaf nodes in the tree structures have no dependencies.\nDependencies visualised in a tree structure can help in easily getting rid of the unnecessary packages.\n\nA: To see brew packages :\nbrew list\n\nTo see cask packages :\nbrew list --cask\n\nTo see upgradable brew packages :\nbrew outdated\n\nTo see upgradable cask packages\nbrew outdated --cask\n\n\nA: You can use this snippet to list all installed packages and sort them by their size.\nbrew list --formula | \\\n    xargs -n1 -P8 -I {} \\\n    sh -c \"\n        brew info {} | \\\n        egrep '[0-9]* files, ' | \\\n        sed 's/^.*[0-9]* files, \\(.*\\)).*$/{} \\1/'\n    \" | \\\n    sort -h -r -k2 - | \\\n    column -t\n\n\nA: brew leaves shows you all top-level packages; packages that are not dependencies.

(total of 800mA in your case, which is very close to the limit of 900mA):\nThe peripheral can then ask the host to recognize it as a high-power device through a process called enumeration.\nOnce enumeration is complete and permission is granted, the peripheral current limitation increases to 500 mA for that device, but remember the internal limit is 900mA for all.\nYour second Error (SetFeature(kUSBFeatureDeviceRemoteWakeup) failed!\nThe USB specification also includes a suspend mode that supports remote wake-up.\nThis mode limits quiescent current to a total of 500 µA for a low-power device and 2.5 mA for a high-power device; it often requires switches to power down portions of the peripheral's electronics.

When I want to run .sh files in Terminal, I need to put sh in front of them.\nIs there any way to avoid this, and thus save typing?\n\nA: If you're running your script from the shell, you don't actually need the #!/bin/sh shebang as outlined in this this answer–every Unix-like system I've used, including OS X, will default to /bin/sh if no interpreter is specifically specified (though it's a good idea as non-shells won't know how to execute your script unless you give the shebang.)\nYou also don't need an .sh extension.  You do need to set executable permissions, e.g.\n$ chmod +x script.sh\n\n(The $ is the shell prompt; I'm using it to illustrate commands you give to the interactive shell.  Don't type it!)\nHowever, I think what your confusion is is that you have created a script, e.g. script.sh, in the current directory, and are trying to execute it by simply typing script.sh.  e.g.\n$ cat >script.sh\necho hello, world\n^D\n$ chmod +x script.sh\n$ script.sh\n-bash: script.sh: command not found\n\n(^D means control-D.  You will find this notation in many writeups on using Unix.)\nThe fact that script.sh in this case is a shell script is only half the problem; your actual issue is that, by default, the shell will not search the current directory for a program.  However, this works:\n$ sh script.sh\nhello, world\n\nbecause sh is taking the script as an argument.\nYou can execute a script–or, again, any executable–in the current directory, if it is marked executable (i.e. chmod +x), by specifying that you want to run the one in the current directory:\n$ ./script.sh\nhello, world\n\nYou can also move the script to a directory on your PATH.  I recommend /usr/local/bin for this if your script is intended to be used system-wide, or a bin directory in your home if the script is only for you.  The latter requires you to add $HOME/bin, which expands to your new bin directory, to your PATH by adding the following lines to your .profile in your home directory:\nPATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\nFinally, you can, if you want, actually add the current directory to your PATH, which will allow you to just go to a directory containing script.sh–or any other executable–and type\n$ script.sh\n\nto execute it.  However, I do not recommend this practice, as an attacker can now trick you into running an arbitrary executable by dropping an executable script (named, say, ls) into a directory you will be in.  If you really want to do it, though, just add the following to your .profile:\nPATH=.:$PATH\nexport PATH\n\n\nA: You don't need to call sh if the script file is marked as executable. In that case, you can call it my name just like you would any other command from the existing shell.\n\nTo be fully proper, you'll want to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your script to include a shebang directive at the top of your script:\n#!/bin/sh\n... That would tell the shell which interpreter to use to run the script; in this case, the /bin/sh executable.\n\n*Mark the script as executable by you with the chmod command:\nchmod u+x scriptname.sh\nOnce you do both of those, you should be able to run your script by typing your script's file name on the command line.  You'll need to be in the same directory as your script, unless you also take the added step of adding the containing folder to your PATH variable. If you don't care what shell runs the script, you don't need step one to specify sh but it's often better to be precise and set the \"shebangsh\".\n", "Q: Safely destroying Apple Software RAID 1 If an Apple Software RAID (RAID 1, mirrored) exists and one of its members is failed. It is possible to destroy the RAID and keep the data on the functional disk intact? If so, how is this accomplished. \n\nA: In general, Disk Utility forces you to erase a drive to turn on or off the RAID wrapper it places on the actual data.\nIf you set up a mirrored set (RAID 1) you still have access to the data and could just ignore the RAID wrapper since it allows you to add more drives as mirrors in the future, but doesn't force you to do so and you can keep using it as a single drive perpetually. I might turn off AutoMirror on that drive to ensure the OS never decides another drive is the master and proceeds to delete your data (an edge case, but I'd hate to experience this no matter how remote the chance).\nThe method Apple recommends to undo RAID is to back up the data elsewhere and delete the RAID wrapper and then copy the data back. My guess is if you erased the RAID wrapper and didn't otherwise do anything to the drive file recovery software could patch back together most if not all the files but I certainly wouldn't risk it for any data I wasn't prepared to walk away from.\n", "Q: Youtube 2.0 Playback Error on iOS Relevant info:\niPhone 5, ios 6.1 (jailbroken)\nUpdated to latest version of youtube app (2.0.0.70=804) which I think initially was working.

I bought a Dell U2713HM because it was highly rated and had 2560x1440 resolution, but, after learning that the HDMI connection only provides 1980x1080, I purchased from Apple their Thunderbolt to DVI connector and tried that. Still 1980x1080. I've now ordered a mini-DisplayPort-to-DisplayPort connector and am praying that I get the full resolution that way, but I've seen a number of user group comments that you need a completely separate (over $100) Thunderbolt data (not display) interface to get the full resolution. If that's true, I'm returning the Dell.

For that you'd need a dual-link DVI connection, and in your case a mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI converter like this one. It costs $99, but you could probably get a generic Chinese clone on DealExtreme or eBay for much less. I can't speak for the mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort converter as I'm not familiar with the DisplayPort standard.\n\nA: Today I made this happen on my Mac Book Pro 15\" Retina Late 2013 model by simply using a HDMI cable.

When i open a new window in terminal i get this: !\n\nI was trying to install MacPorts approximately a year ago and that did not go well. \nSince i don't use terminal very often I just left it that way.\nNow I would like to have it working again!\nI tried to delete the com.apple.terminal.plist file and I am stuck.\nWhen I enter my password the shell turns from sudo to tee and everything I enter is just repeated!\n\nWhen I don't enter my password I get a useable shell.\nWhat can I do to prevent the sudo command from reopening?\n\n\nA: What you have is a bad set of shell startup files, so the first thing to do is regain control of your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not log out or reboot (just in case the damage will prevent a new log in - unlikely, but why risk it - especially if you don't have a good backup)\n\n*Open System Preferences\n\n*Make a new Admin account and enable fast user switching\n\n*Save whatever work in other apps you cannot afford to lose\n\n*Use the menu bar to log in as the new admin account\n\n\nAt that point, you'll know if that new user has full shell access or if you somehow messed up the files that set up all user shell processes.\nYou can go about removing MacPorts from the new user as well as be sure you have a good backup before you go in to clear the files that are messing up your current user's shell login process. Since your port install isn't functioning - try to run the port uninstall, but proceed with the manual rm command to actually remove the items in /opt and elsewhere that were installed.\nhttp://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.macports.uninstalling.html\nAt that point, you can also try cleaning up files elsewhere - here are the files MacPorts should have changed on you, so you may have to delete all of these and/or recover them from a clean instal or a backup from before when MacPorts touched them:\n\nDepending on your shell and which configuration files already exist, the installer may use .profile, .bash_login, .bash_profile, .tcshrc, or .cshrc.\n\nThe cleaning for you might also involve:\ncd /Users\nsudo -s\ncd broken\ntar -cvf ./bash_broken.tar .bash*\nrm -i .bash*\n\nThat will make a backup tar file of all your broken bash startup files (.bash_history, .bahsrc, etc…) Be careful with the sudo - if you rm the wrong file, there is no trashcan or undo. The -i flag will have rm ask you if you want to delete each file. You want to remove pretty much all of them except maybe the history file (so you can look back at what you did in the past if needed).\nOnce you've removed the files, log out of the new user and back into the old user and see about whether that fixed your terminal problems.\n\nA: First of all, there are a number of commands you can try to break out of whatever weird shell state you're in. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z, and Ctrl+\\ may exit the sudo command, and Ctrl+D would exit the 'tee.'  Assuming the command is not running as your controlling shell (which it probably isn't, judging by how not entering your password gives you a shell), one of those will likely get you back to your actual shell (e.g. bash).  Then you should look at the following files to see what's putting you in that state:\n/etc/profile\n.bashrc\n.login\n.bash_profile\n.profile\n\nYou can also edit those files from any OSX text editor (rather than having to get into a shell to do it), although it's a bit tricky - from the \"file open\" dialog, press Cmd+Shift+G and then type the full path to it (i.e. /etc/profile or /Users/username/.bashrc).\nIt's also possible that your login shell itself may have been changed in some way. In that case, you need to go to the Users & Groups system preferences, then ctrl-click on your username, then select \"Advanced Options.\"  Ensure that the \"login shell\" dropdown reads /bin/bash.\n", "Q: USB drive accessible from Ubuntu laptop but can't find on OSX using Disk Utility or `df`` I have a 3T SATA hard drive in a USB enclosure.

Worst case, you could remove the partitions that aren't standard and run the conversion.

Is this the case? I don't want to delete these folders if someone can't confirm that its safe to do so, because I don't trust iCloud to do the logical thing in this situation, which would be happily accept the fact that I deleted these empty  folders.\nCuriously, I have some applications that I know are syncing through iCloud, because I have the same data on my iPhone and my iPad, but don't have corresponding folders in ~/Library/Mobile Documents on my Mac. Do some iOS applications store their data in a different location?\nNone of this seems logical, so can anyone make sense of this and provide some insight into what iCloud is doing behind the scenes here?\n\nA: ~/Library/Mobile Documents is basically a mapped network location(to iCloud) and allows you to interact with the documents created by certain apps(default location) most likely they are left over from poor un-installers not cleaning up after themselves or left intact on purpose incase you decide to re-install at some point.\nI would contend that it is safe to delete if you don't plan on using those applications, and also assuming if they are generated by an application that when they are needed they will regenerate themselves as needed. Make a copy of them and put them on your desktop and delete them to see what happens. If it breaks copy them back.\nOn a side note, are you doing this just to keep things clean? Are you in this directory through finder enough that these folders slow your navigation down? I appreciate wanting to keep things clean, however their existence probably won't slow down any indexing by spotlight, use any bandwidth by iCloud or take up a significant amount of HDD space.\n", "Q: Does the reception indicator show voice or data signal strength, or are they the same? I was informed by multiple people at T-Mobile that having a strong data connection doesn't necessarily mean a strong voice connection, but that confused me and I'm not sure if they're right. So how do the two relate? If there's strong LTE and weak EDGE would the iPhone show full bars or low bars, and would that tell you both how good the voice and data signal is or just one of those?\n\nA: The bars on the phone are representation for Voice signals. A full bar will mean you will have the clear calls, on the other hand, the data can be seen by the type of Data service you are getting, LTE,3G(WCDMA),H or 3.5G(HSPA) and E(EDGE). Despite having the full connection bars you may have an E(For EDGE) which may give a slower network connection. It's the same thing the other way round as well, Despite getting a LTE network you may not be getting full bars, It depends on the Network tower you are connected to, the data it supports. Generally near the areas with people using less Internet over the network the companies put up towers which are good for voice signals. \n\nA: Every phone only uses one antenna at a time, so, if you see the LTE icon on the statusbar, that means that it's connected on a LTE signal only, so, it goes for the voice and data signal.\n\nA: tubedogg was right..EDGE is only a Data signal and doesn't support voice calls. same goes with LTE as well, momentarily LTE voice calls have not come into existence except few operators from US, UK & china.

My iMac (late 2009) did, however, not detect the HD when I connect it. Since I cannot see it, I am unable to format it. The HD is also not shown in the Terminal after df -h. When I type diskutil list, however, I get the following from Terminal:\n0:                                                   *4.1 GB     disk1\n\nAfter diskutil list the HD is now shown in \"Disc Utilities\" but featured as \"non-writeable\" and I cannot create a partition or format it. Not sure why but I suspect that the problem could be the SK-3500 enclosure and I should try another enclosure.\nIf you have any ideas what else I could try (aside from trying another enclosure), I would appreciate any input very much.\n\nA: The Datastore SK-3500 Super-S Combo enclosure only supports HDDs up to 2 TB.

I've tried deleting it on Daisy Disk as an admin but I couldn't delete it. I don't know why it's happening but all I remember is using rEFIt and creating a partition a couple of months ago. I do remember deleting the partition and it was alright until now. \n\n\n\nA: My guess is the software did subtraction to show you the value of \"hidden space\" and the only thing going on is that the operating system user that ran the tool doesn't have read permission in some directories where files are stored and cannot show you a breakdown of those files. Basically, it added up all the files it could count, totaled their size (161.5 GB), noticed that the disk says there is only 86.85 GB free and told you that the balance of 250.8 GB was hidden space.\nYou can test this by opening terminal and pasting this one command:\ndu -sg /Users/*\n\nThis tells the system to calculate the disk usage in gigabytes of each user folder (and the shared folder). This is part of the way that the system protects one users files from being read by another user. Watch for errors showing places you do not have read permission.\nYou can also see this effect in finder by turning on View -> Show View Options and clicking \"Calculate all sizes\" \n\nI have three users on this computer and when I use Finder or the program What Size (it shares some common functionality with Daisy Disk and also has a version on the app store as well as a more powerful version that ships separately) the normal measurement cannot see in folders where my \"user\" has no permission to go.\n\nWhen I toggle the measurement as a user or as the admin / you can see in the second screen that the accounts starting with a and r have at least 250 folders and about 1000 files each. In this case, they don't occupy much space, but in your case, 250 GB of files are stored in locations where your tool cannot measure them.\n\nHopefully this helps explain why the tool is showing you hidden files. If you have multiple users on that Mac, perhaps running the tool once for each and looking in the /Users folder, you can locate where the space is being used. If you do not have multiple user accounts, you will have to see if Daisy Disk has the ability to run in admin mode or use the terminal to calculate disk usage where you can run the command as the \"root user\" by adding a sudo and typing your account's password to let the system grant access to those normally non-readable files.\nMac:~ me$ sudo du -sg /Users/*\nPassword:\n39  /Users/Shared\n1   /Users/aaa\n132 /Users/mmm\n1   /Users/rrr\n\n\nA: Try starting up from the recovery partition and repairing the main OS X volume (like Macintosh HD, indented below a drive) from Disk Utility.\nI had a similar problem, but there was only about 25 GB of disk space classified as \"hidden space\" by DaisyDisk. When I used Disk Utility to verify the Macintosh HD volume, there was an error about an invalid free block count, but I was able to get rid of the error and free up the hidden space by repairing the volume from the recovery partition.\n", "Q: How do I get Automator to process images using ImageMagick in a command script? I'm making an Automator workflow that uses the shell script action to process a selection of images with the imagemagick composite command. Only I'm having issues getting it going. According to the results I get when I run the workflow, everything is working however, I know it's not due to the fact that the changes I'd expect to see in the folder of images are not present. I know that the imagemagick command I'm using is correct as it works correctly from the console. (I echoed the composite command to the output & copied it into a Terminal session. Ran like a charm). BTW: The workflow's for processing a fade in on a stop motion movie I made. Yes I know I could use video tools to achieve the same thing, but the ones I have access to screw up the image quality on output.\nHere's the script\nimagesCount=$#\nrate=$(echo \"scale=2; 100/$imagesCount\"|bc)\npercentage=$rate\nfor f in \"$@\"; do\n    fileName=${f%.*}\n    composite -blend \"$percentage\" -size 1280x720 \"$f\" xc:black -alpha Set \"$fileName-1.jpg\"\n    percentage=$(echo \"scale=2; $percentage+$rate\"|bc)\ndone\n\nAt first I thought at the cause of the problem might be spaces in the paths, but I removed this possibility by shifting the files to a path without spaces, but that had no effect.\nI'm almost certain the issue is related to something in the bash command but I don't know bash at all, this is my first time writing any bash command scripts, but I am very knowledgeable in Windows console scripting and would have no trouble getting this to work there.\nIf the error in the script isn't obvious enough to catch, would someone propose a method to debug this so I can figure out why the images are not getting processed even though the script runs without error?\n\nA: I would just do the whole thing at the command line as a shell script instead of using Automator to launch it. Put #!/bin/bash as the first line, and run it as \nmyscript.sh image*.png \nwhere image*.png is your set of image files that you are apparently selecting in Automator?\nIf you need to run it on all files in a folder, that can be done too.\nYou can also test your script in automator using echo ${f%.*} instead of the commands themselves.\n\nA: Replace for $f with for f. for $f in aa; do :; done results in an error like `$f': not a valid identifier.\nAlso if composite is not on the path, specify the full path to it (like /usr/local/bin/composite).\n", "Q: Disable repeated \"You don't have permission to use the application\" dialog boxes We have set up parental controls on a child account to disable all but whitelisted applications from running.

So, the keyboard doesn’t work on the laptop. I hooked up a keyboard to the USB port so I can still use it. I’m using a Dell keyboard.\nLast night I wanted to listen to music without the brightness of the screen. So without thinking I turned the brightness off. Now I can't get the screen back so I was wondering if there's a way I can use the Dell keyboard to get the screen brightness back?\n\nA: You can also use Apple Script - if you can ssh into your mac, you can then, in the ssh session, type the following: \nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\"\nkey code 113\nend tell'\n\nPlease note, that you actually need to press Enter at the end of each line. Also, be careful with the quote characters - there's a single quote after the -e option, and then a closing single quote at the end of line 3 above (following the end tell). Each execution of the script will increase the brightness by one notch. If you want it dimmer, change 113 to 107. \nIf this is something you see yourself use more often, then it might be worth it to either define an alias or write a small shell script, eg: \nMacBook:~ alias brightup=\"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n> key code 113\n> end tell'\"\n\nand:\nMacBook:~ alias brightdn=\"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n> key code 107\n> end tell'\"\n\nAgain, be careful with the quotes. When you put the above aliases into your .bashrc, all you'll need to type is brightup or brightdn. \nAdditional info\nIf you can't ssh into your box, you can blindly type the first osascript command. I would do it in the following way: \n\n\n*\n\n*press CommandSpace\n\n*type terminal and press Enter\n\n*blindly and slowly (and carefully) type the first osascript... command from the example above, exactly as it is there. This should bump the brightness up a bit, enough so that you should see what you're doing. If not, try a couple of times to press Up ArrowEnter\n\nA: key: \"scroll lock\" to decrease brightness\nkey: \"pause\" to increase brightness\n\nA: You could try resetting the NVRAM (a.k.a. PRAM). Shut down your Mac, then when you turn it back on, holding down commandoptionPR (windowsaltPR on a PC keyboard) until the computer restarts again.\nThe NVRAM typically stores hardware settings like brightness, volume, etc.\n\nA: The \"Scroll Lock\" and \"Page Break\" are acting \"F14\" and \"F15\", respectively, for non-Apple keyboards. Make sure you turn-off / disconnected the bluetooth / hardware connection to the Apple Keyboard, then the Mac will recognize the non-Apple USB keyboard's \"Scroll Lock\" and \"Page Break\" as brightness shortcuts.\n\nA: Use this free application from the apple store\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brightness-menu-bar/id451140932?mt=12\n\nA: If you previously use GUI to control brightness, then pressing F2 or Fn+F2 should turn on the brightness back.\n\nA: I have a similiar issue with my macbook pro upon booting. at the login screen (password entry) it is often set to the previous brightness when I shut it down (from what I gather).  \nI tried the fn 1 and fn2 but nothing worked.  I believe these commands were farmed out to the fancy new bar atop the keyboard (I forget what its called).  regardless, the option to change the brightness isnt available until the machine has booted up a user.  \nperhaps an update an fix the issue or someone knows a workaround until then.  \n\nA: You can install an app that can control brightness from the AppStore.\nthe name of app is: Brightness Slider\n\nA: there is a very simple solution : just reboot\n", "Q: OS X Lion factory refresh problem I just bought a MacBook Pro from a buddy. He wiped the HD for me and returned it to factory settings. So now when I start it, it says I have to redownload OS X Lion. So once I start the download it asks for my Apple ID and when I type it in it says I never bought the software and stops downloading. So now I have a computer that doesn't technically work at the moment.\nAny way to fix this problem would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: If your machine shipped with Lion (or later) preinstalled, you don't need to provide a user account and password as that serial number is used to validate ownership of the OS and the installer will re-download itself for free. This download happens from the Recovery HD and not from within the App Store.\nIf your machine shipped with an OS earlier than Lion (say it was shipped before Lion was released or just when Lion was released and the first user got a free upgrade to Lion), then your factory condition is before Lion. To get Lion, run 10.6.6 or later and log into the App Store app. You will need to purchase the Lion upgrade yourself or have an account that has that upgrade purchased already. \nIn summary, the only software license that transfers with the hardware is the shipping versions of the OS and not the upgrades that you apply after the initial purchase.\n", "Q: Apple Gift Card I received a $100 apple gift card. I already redeemed it on my account.   \nAm I able to use this to purchase products on the Apple Store? \n\nA: No - cards that you \"redeem\" are app store cards and only work in the app stores for music, books, movies, apps in the form of digital downloads or rentals.\nIn summer 2013, Apple has 3 names for gift cards (and many designs for the third name). Shown from http://www.apple.com/gift-cards/ is the following image:\n\nThe former is what most people buy for Apps, Books and Music and can be redeemed through an Apple ID that is paired with either the iTunes store or the Mac App Store. It's the colorful set of cards in the middle above and there are many other designs worldwide.\nThe left most and right most cards are the iPhone gift card and the traditional silver card with a white Apple logo. Those cards can buy almost anything from the Apple online and physical stores. You need to present that card as part of the purchase an item and it credits you the money towards the purchase as opposed to being redeemed into an account.\nLogistically, you could get a store gift card and use it to buy the app store cards, but you can't go the other way and take a balance (or redeemable balance) on the app store cards and convert it back to product through Apple.\n\nA: http://www.apple.com/gift-cards/\nDepends which kind of gift card you have. An apple card can. \n\nA: Depends on what card you have. If it is  a silver apple card with the apple logo in the middle, you can only use it via online or at a real life store. But you can exchange it for an app store, iBook, or iTunes card. Hope I Helped :)\n\nA: Apple gift card can only be used to purchase on the mac app store, the iphone and ipad app store, the iTunes store and the iBooks store. You cannot use it to buy hardware.\n", "Q: How can I watching TV shows and movies from Hulu or Netflix while being offline on my iPad or Nexus?

Is there way though to connect both of them at once, so that I have two external monitors managed by the MacBook? Obviously, the MacBook only has one Thunderbolt port, but there’s an extra one available on the iMac. Any way to utilise it in this case?\n\nA: Short Answer\nYes, but you need a USB display adapter (any DisplayLink adapter, like this one should do) for your MacBook Air, the iMac can’t do passthrough.\nLonger Answer\nThe 2009 iMacs don’t have Thunderbolt, only mini-Displayport. Even the later iMacs with Thunderbolt can’t do passthrough with their second Thunderbolt ports. Therefore you need a second display connection on the source Mac. Since the MBA only has one, you’ll need to use a USB-based adapter. There are many options, pretty much all of them using the DisplayLink technology.

If there's a 90% full iPad at any amount of storage, what does the bulk of the usage come from? (I'd imagine media like music, photo and video shooting, etc but would rather hear from experts with some experience) Perhaps this is just careful developers at work, but you can get a lot of apps and still see very little space being used so I don't see why I would need anything more than 16 GB with my level of experience.\nI'm looking for people with experience running an iOS device at more than 75% full for several months to explain what they've learned and perhaps explain whether they can live with the devices they initially bought or how they would take their current experience to select a new device.\n\nA: My 64GB iPhone has several hundred apps on it, mostly games, about 9GB of photos/personal videos, 3GB of music, and ~5GB of free space right now.

Now desktop hard drives have become affordable enough to buy way more than most personal users need (unless you want ssd) ; but we're back into the pushing-the-limits stage with phones and tablets. \nMy thoughts (i don't have any hard data here, just thinking) en the iPad/iPhone storage disparity are:\n\n\n*\n\n*More feature-rich apps that take up more space\n\n*People use iPad more for watching  hd media, which need more pixels and therefore more storage. \n\n*Games with better graphics that take up more space.  Especially on newest ipad display. \n\n*more often used for things like Photoshop, garage-band, video editing. Storage-hungry apps like that are better suited to the iPad form-factor and screen-size. \n", "Q: Time separators blinks inconsistently If I have OS X display the time in the menu bar with blinking separators, the seem to blink inconsistently. I've taken a 32 second video of the effect. It's happening on two of my MacBook Airs, 13\" Mid 2011 model. Running MacOSX 10.8.4. One is used at work and the other is my personal machine.\nI know that this is a rather small issue but I'm still very curious on what might be causing this problem.\nUpdate\nLooks like it's fixed in Mavericks!\n\nA: Some thoughts about how to track this down:\n\n\n*\n\n*In System Preferences > Language & Text > Region, do you have any unusual settings?  (Some of these influence the formatting of the clock... from the video, you have the same settings as me, but I wonder if you have anything unusual here that perhaps Apple haven't tested too well?)\n\n*Is there any pattern to the absence / presence of the separators?  Eg, from your video, I see they are absent at 46, 47 and 48 seconds: is this true for every minute?  (In which case, perhaps the cause of this might be some logic bug in the code that determines whether the separators should be shown for a given number of seconds.)\n\n*I believe the SystemUIServer process controls many of the icons on the menu bar, including the clock.  If you use Activity Monitor to quit it, it will quickly relaunch, but you'll get some insight into what that process is doing.\nSome thoughts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is SystemUIServer perhaps using a lot of CPU?\n\n*Try removing any non-Apple menu bar icons for the moment (by quitting the appropriate apps), and see if the issue goes away.  I suggest this because: even if SystemUIServer isn't using much CPU (and the system CPU load is low), I suspect that if one of the menu icons it controls blocks (that is: performs some system call which doesn't immediately return, perhaps because it is waiting for some data), then the updates of the clock might be paused.\nAfter discussion below, seems that unfortunately none of this has helped to isolate the issue.  The only remaining possibility I can think of is that you've run into an Apple bug... in which case, you might consider reporting it at bugreport.apple.com.  (I have a paid developer account, but I believe that isn't required to report bugs there.)\n\nA: Maybe your system is going unresponsive between times. According to this book,\n\nif the colon stops blinking, you’ll know your Mac is frozen and you can restart it.\n\nSo, normal blinking says that your mac is faster and if it is slowing down, you may be running some expensive operation running. I experience this whenever I run Photoshop.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2012 single beep while on My MacBook Air 2012 is making a single beep during normal use. So far it has done this twice in the last 20 minutes so I don't know if there is an interval yet.\nA cursory Google search only showed something about people having boot issues with multiple beeps when trying to start the machine. I am using this machine (it's already booted without issues) so I don't think that is relevant to me.\nThe machine isn't running hot, which would also be normal. So what does this beep mean? Insight appreciated.\n\nA: SoundBunny has a free demo available which will work for 30 days, this app will show you every app which is makes a sound. That might help you track it down. You can also tell it to ignore apps which you have ruled out, which should help you narrow things down a but too. The purpose of SoundBunny is to let you set the volume for each app, but I thought it might help with this as well.\nTJ Luoma posted this answer to a similar question here: apple.stackexchange.com.\n", "Q: Rubberized stylus, not moving smooth on iPad glass, any tricks? I have a Targus stylus for my iPad, with a rubber tip.\nThis tip, however, does not move smoothly over the glass on the iPad, but seems to have too high friction. It didn't have this when I bought it, and I also have a different stylus that is much smaller, also with a rubber tip, that still moves smoothly over the glass.\nThe large one, however, gets \"stuck\" on the screen. Not like glue \"stuck\", just doesn't move as smoothly as I'd like.\nWhat tricks can I use to get it back to how it was when I bought it? Has it accrued fat from my fingers or something like that I can wash off, or are there other things I can do? Has anyone experienced this and solved it?\n\nA: I think most of these answers are pure speculation and the long term effects on your iPad's screen are at question.\nI would suggest that you simply look to replace the stylus as it has evidently worn out. It may be that they are not very durable products, but I certainly wouldn't recommend trying to hack a solution over just buying a new stylus.\n\nA: In some cases using a lubricant like Silicon grease would help.\nJust enough to lubricate, then wipe it off with tissue.\nSilicon grease is transparent so you will not \"see\" the marks on the screen.\nBetter solution is to find a Silicon rubber tip.\n\nA: Lightly coat the rubber with a thin film superglue. Make sure the glue is smooth with no bubbles or ripples.  Let it dry. Clean your screen and voila smooth gliding stylus. \n\nA: This may be only a coincidence, but I felt that the stylus tip might have gotten dirty.  I rubbed it against a soft cloth, and it started working again. Can't guarantee it will work for everyone, but it only takes a few seconds to find out.\n\nA: Temporary solution (1-2 hours): dip the nib in flour and rub the flour in. Tap it to knock off the visible flour.\n\nA: Thus far corn starch. But doesn't last. Believe it or not I've found my actual facial oils from my face have seems to work the best and last longer.\n\nA: Tape a small piece of scotch tape to the end and replace regularly\n\nA: Push the rubber tip in so you have a hard end, making you able to use it easily.\n\nA: Spray the rubber end with anti-perspirant.\n\nA: Working off the pr vinous post, i used a touch of deodorant (the stick kind) it's as good as new \n", "Q: SuperDrive - one in five dvds won't mount I recently turned my 2009 mac mini into a mediacenter. \nIt appears that about one in five of my dvds will not even mount. I suppose this has to do with some copy protection. Same goes for my music CDs.\nI would be willing to buy an external drive - but I'm worried that in the end it will have the same issue (and I won't be able return a \"functional\" drive). And so far I don't know which \"feature\" will be required to play all DVDs.\nWeb search only gave me info on failing drives that won't read any media. But as I can reliably read some media I don't think these apply to my case.\nI hope someone can shed some light on this issue.\nSome additional info\nAbout the mac mini - in the course of turning it into a media center I did a fresh install of mountain lion with latest updates. The only additional software installed is XBMC and VLC. So I doubt this might be a software issue.\nBefore that I hardly used the drive. I think I only used it like a dozen times. Also didn't burn any disk.\nDVDs won't open in the Mac DVD player software and not even mount as data disc.\n\nA: It would be good to know if the one in five is the same disk each time, or if it's more a case of roughly every 5 attempts the mount fails.  If it's the same discs everytime, then you could further troubleshoot by trying them in other devices.  If it's random discs, then it's likely your drive that needs troubleshooting.\nDoes it make any weird grinding noises, or excessive head seek operations before giving up on mounting?  And does it sometimes fail to eject the drive if it has failed to mount?  I ask because this is exactly what my iMac superdrive (2009 era) did.  Sometimes it would read, sometimes if would make awful noises, sometimes it wouldn't eject because it said there was no disc when there was.\nI eventually removed it and replaced it with an SSD instead, and for the price of a few dollars on eBay I bought an external USB case for it to see if I could get it working at all - it's worked fine ever since!  Maybe just being rough with it and being able to shake it about and stuff when I removed it (in a way I couldn't so when it was internal to the iMac) helped?\nIf it is the drive, you have limited repair options other than percussive maintenance, a monster clean with a vacumm nozzle right down the slots, and re-seating the cables etc.  You could try putting your Mac Mini on it's side when inserting discs - sounds daft, but I've know this to work with failing drives.\nAs for replacing it, then any DVD drive is going to be absolutely fine if you just want to read discs.  Frankly you will struggle get a DVD-ROM, and anything you buy will be a writer also, but there is no need to go for the fancy options like dual layer burning, lightscribe lazer etching, Blu Ray playback etc etc.\n", "Q: How to set AirPlay device name of the hosting computer?

I'm on a macbook aluminium late 2008 10.5.8. I'm planning to upgrade it a little bit since many applications doesn't support my system anymore.\nAt the beginning I was tempted to upgrade to 10.8 but after I read some reviews saying that it's not that good (crushes/need reboot etc) maybe it's better if I just upgrade to 10.6 then reconsider further upgrades in the future.\nI just wanted to ask if it's possible to keep all my files and applications while upgrading or if it's mandatory to format and install the new system from scratch.\nI'm sure that a clean installation will be better but it would require me much more time in order to backup everything and/or re-install everything I need.\n\nA: An upgrade in place should be absolutely fine.  I'm sure you can find anecdotal evidence of it crashing for some people, but it's not something that crops on on here more than occasionally.\nNote that you cannot jump direct to 10.8 though, sadly (unless you can borrow the install media from someone with a copy) because 10.7 and 10.8 are both sold via the Mac App store, and I think (someone will correct me on this) that this is only available on 10.6.8 systems and later...\nIf you know someone else with a Mac that has access to the Mac App Store, you can use their to log in and purchase it so that you are properly licensed, but there is no official way to actually download and upgrade from a 10.5 system (although it is relatively trivial if you can get the media).\nIf you wanted to stage via 10.6 first, that would ease your upgrade to 10.8 (or 10.9 which is due very soon), but you may conversely struggle to find original media for 10.6 (grabbing an original CD from eBay would work so long as the disc is undamaged, but technically it's almost certain that you would not be officially licensed to install it if it was used by the original purchaser to upgrade from 10.5 already, or if it was subsequently used to upgrade to 10.7 or 10.8 - however this is very much a problem for your morals and honesty, because there are no license keys or other media checks in place for Apple to spot this)\n", "Q: MacPorts: How do I make py32-scipy not depend on gcc48? MacPorts has many unnecessary dependencies. I need to disable the dependency of py32-scipy on gcc48 because gcc48 won't build on my system for some reason.

I've got a working gcc; I don't need gcc48.\n\nA: Unfortunately py32-scipy does depend on gcc4.8 as it depends on some c libraries which is a set of numerical routines that are optimised to run on your machine and so I think need to be compiled there.\nNormally Macports does not compile but downloads precompiled binaries so you should not need to compile gcc48. So check the vlue of buildfromsource in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf it should be ifneeded. It does do this for me on OSX 10.8 got gcc4.8.\nAlso check you have the latest ports (gcc48 and the std C++ libraries have caused much comment on the macports mailing lists so will have changed) by running sudo port selfupdate \nYou can give py32-scipy a variant to chnage the version of gcc used but that will still need a macports gcc compiler as Xcode 4 does not come with gcc but a program that looks like gcc but uses clang.\n", "Q: Where are the states of opened/closed folders saved in OS X?

What's going on here?\n\nA: For people stumbling upon this in an OS X 10.11+ era (El Capitan or newer): Apple has added a whole new layer of security in OS X. They have taken away some privileges from root. The file you are trying to modify has a restricted flag. Only restricted processes which are signed by Apple will be able to modify these files. However, you can disable this security system by booting in recovery mode and disabling it in a Terminal by doing: csrutil disable.\nAlternatively, you can also just start Terminal in Recovery Mode and delete the file there. Or even try booting in a Linux environment with HFS+ support (at least if you're not on APFS yet) to change the file.\n\nA: Sounds like the file is locked to me, which is why the uchg attribute is appearing. You should be able to use the following command to remove the locked attribute:\nchflags nouchg file\n\nor right-click the file in the Finder, click \"Get Info\" then uncheck the \"Locked\" checkbox\n\nA: I had a file I couldn't delete in terminal:\n$ sudo ls -leO@ foo@example.com/Documents/.%cb_defense/cb.doc\n-rw-rw-rw-  1 root  wheel  - 41984  1 Mar 11:20 foo@example.com/Documents/.%cb_defense/cb.doc\n\n$ sudo rm -rf foo@example.com/Documents/.%cb_defense/cb.doc\nrm: foo@example.com/Documents/.%cb_defense/cb.doc: Operation not permitted\n\nWhat worked for me was opening Finder and deleting the containing directory whole. The way I understand it, Finder deletes directories as a unit entirely disregarding their contents, so it's not subject to the same restrictions as regular rm -rf.\n\nA: Try:\nchflags -f -R nouchg directory\n\non a higher level directory to stop this problem.\n\nA: I had this issue too, and I discovered that the folder the file was in was locked. So make sure that's not true. Do 'get info' on the folder in the finder, and make sure the locked checkbox is not checked.\n\nA: Under OS 10.15 this worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*Recovery mode: command + R\n\n*Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*rm -r /path/to/file/or/dir/to/remove (The -r alone worked for me -- If you need it rm -rf force mode)\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: A previous answer said to use:\nchflags -f -R nouchg directory\n\nThere are two different attributes that prevent changing a file.  \"uchg\" prevents the user from changing the file; \"schg\" prevents the system from making a change.  Use ls -le0@ to see which is your problem, or use apple-I: if \"locked\" is checked but not greyed out, then \"uchg\" is set. If \"locked\" is checked AND greyed out, then \"schg\" is set.)  If \"uchg\" is set, the previous answer will work.  If  \"schg\" is set, then do this instead:\nchflags -f -R noschg directory\n\n\nA: Before using arcane commands, confirm your System Preferences\nTerminal may not have permission to access your present working directory.\n\n*\n\n*Note your path (e.g. in Terminal, type pwd).\n\n*Visit System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders\n\n*Confirm there is a check mark next to any volumes and directories that appear in your path.\n\nIf Terminal has permissions and the command still gets an error, check the solutions provided in other answers.\n\nA: I realize this is a very old topic but I don't see this thread addressing my symptom so I thought I'd post another opinion.\nI had this happen to an external drive that had been functioning perfectly on a Snow Leopard iMac, which got upgraded to El Capitan along the way.  Earlier this year, I took that drive and put it in a new Windows 10 box which was running Paragon HFS for Windows.  I copied hundreds of GB of files FROM Windows TO HFS+ on that drive and plugged it back into the iMac.  Everything worked fine, except one shell script I had that staged files for backup encountered this uchg issue.\nIn short: files and folders created under El Capitan or Windows 10 using Paragon HFS, when moved back to a Snow Leopard box, the \"locked\" radio box will NOT be checked when you select Get Info in the Finder.  However, others' suggestions worked fine for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*verify that's the issue by running ls -leO@ (that's a capital oh) on a suspect file\n\n*as root, run chflags -R nouchg on the parent directory (there's no -f in Snow Leopard)\n\n\nIt'll work, just don't expect the exact same visual cues if your drive has gone between operating systems or if you use Paragon HFS.\n", "Q: Can't change displays refresh rate I'm using OS X 10.8.3 and I want to change the refresh rate of my display, but I can't.

When I click it, I can see there is also a 75 Hertz item there, but it's greyed out and unavailable. If I change Resolution to Scaled, then I'm presented with a list of resolutions I can pick. For some resolutions, 75 Hertz is available, but then another problem arises - the entire screen becomes stretched, so there's no point of using 75 Hertz with it. \nHow do I change the refresh rate without stretching the screen from a Mac Mini MD387 and display LG E2242T?\n\nA: To use that refresh rate you would have to lower the resolution to a maximum of 1280x1024.

Iterating would be a time of order-n O(n).\nIn AppleScript, you can possibly use a record of records instead of a list of records, but I believe that then the class of the key would  have to be an identifier -- not integer like in your example.\nHere is a link to somebody with a similar question:\nEmulating associative arrays in AppleScript\nLauri Ranta's answer is to use the command-line tool called \"awk\".\nThe solution that I toyed with was to make a faceless background app that would be what is called an \"Agent\" which AppleScript's could call upon for using its datastructures such as an associative array (also known as a dictionary or a Mapping.)\nI didn't get my solution done.  It's just an idea, but you could use Lauri's answer, she usually knows what she's talking about.\nSince I know a little Pyton, and since Pyton comes with OS X, pre-installed in the System Folder, I would consider using Python myself.\nI tried it again in \"pure AppleScript\" with the following code which I'm not really happy with:\nset theRecords to {fooKey:{key:\"fooKey\", value:\"fooValue\"}, barKey:{key:\"barKey\", value:\"barValue\"}}\ntry\n    set theRecord to get barKey of theRecords\n    display dialog (key of theRecord & \":\" & value of theRecord)\non error errorMessage number errorNumber\n    if errorNumber is not equal to -128 then\n        display dialog \"No match\"\n    end if\nend try\n\nYou can mix shell script and AppleScripts:\n-- in AppleScript, you can call a shell script\ndo shell script \"<enter your shell script here>\"\n\nOr, you can call an AppleScript from a shell script with the command-line tool called \"osascript\".\n\nA: using Foundation framework\nuse AppleScript version \"2.7\"\nuse scripting additions\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\n\nto get_item from pool for item_name\n    set poolData to my (NSDictionary's dictionaryWithDictionary:pool)\n    set poolDataKeys to poolData's allKeys()\n    if (poolDataKeys as list) contains item_name then\n        set item_value to poolData's valueForKey:item_name\n        return item_value as text\n    else\n        return false\n    end if\nend get_item\n\n\nset keyName to \"circle\"\nset pool to {box:\"BOX A\", circle:\"CIRCLE B\"}\nset value to get_item from pool for keyName\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set keyName to \"circle\"\n    set pool to {box:\"BOX A\", circle:\"CIRCLE B\"}\n    set value to get_item of me from pool for keyName\nend tell\n\nfrom 1\n", "Q: Can I limit the number of emails the AOL sends to iPhone? I only want to have a limited number of emails be sent to my iPhone, the most curretn 20 to 40, how can I do this?\n\nA: You can limit the amount fetched from all of your mail accounts, but it cannot be set independently for just the AOL account.  In the settings menu, go to \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" and below where the accounts are listed, there is a section called \"Mail\".  The first option there \"Show\", which limits the mails which are fetched.

I have a formula that references A1:B5 for instance, the result lives in any arbitrary cell, say D1. How do I copy and paste the same formula, referencing the same values as in D1, through the entire column D? For some reason, I can't find this answer anywhere.\nIf I select D1 for instance, and click the bottom right, and drag to use auto-fill, it seems to increment the A1:B5 values which ruins the results.\n\nA: You need to use an absolute reference with $.\nSo that the cell references never changes when doing a copy and paste or fill change it from A1:B5 to $A$1:$B$5.\nIf you want you can even make a reference that is half absolute. The reference $D1 means that when you copy and paste the D will stay the same but the row number will change.\n\nA: Did you try copying the formula from D1 (select the cell and do Copy, not selecting the formula itself). Then select the range of cells D2 to D-whatever and paste. This should work as long as you don't have the text inside the formula definition box selected, but rather you copy the cell itself. \n\nA: You are using Fixed value ($) for Cell A and fixed for field 1 ($A$1) it will copy and repeat that in the row 1, but also in the coulomb D. \nSo try following $A1:$B5 (without $ for the field). \nNow when you pull down it will copy correctly but also in the row 1\n", "Q: absolute path to directory accessed by right click 'Show Package Contents' In OS X Mountain Lion when you right click on an *.app icon you get an option to 'Show Package Contents' leading you into 'Contents' directory. \nI'm having trouble figuring out the absolute path to the 'Contents' directory for a given *.app\nThanks for Help!\n\nA: Any .app is just a folder so if an application is in\n /Applications/Safari.app\n\nthe Contents directory is \n/Applications/Safari.app/Contents\n\nYou can also get the path by Cmd-clicking on the folder name at the top of the Finder window.\n\nA: You can open the terminal app, and then drag any file or folder into it to have the full path displayed in text that you can copy/paste etc.\n", "Q: How to send S/MIME encrypted mails from iOS with attachment? I can only send encrypted mails if I start the mail app directly. But if I try to send a mail from the image gallery, the mails are neither signed nor encrypted (and I can't find a way to enable that).\nEdit: My current (non-acceptable) workaround would be to save the mail as a draft, then open the draft with the default mail app and then send it.\n\nA: I can tell you why this happens but not give you a solution. To me this is a bug, when you 'mail' from within photos or whatever other app, using the modal compose window (the one that pops up from the bottom of the screen) you are using a MFMailComposeViewController class, this is effectively a baby version of mail that pops up and composes mail for you, then redirects this to the mail app.\nSomething is broken in between that's causing your issue.\nBottom line the MFMailComposeViewController (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MessageUI/Reference/MFMailComposeViewController_class/Reference/Reference.html) is not the full mail client and thus it's lacking the encryption piece.\n\nA: This sounds like an iOS bug that there isn't going to be any way to solve, but in the meantime you can add images to an email in the Mail.app.\nTap on the message to bring up the 'Insert Photo' option, as shown below.\nThis isn't a solution, unfortunately, and probably not much better than your current workaround, but it's another option until Apple fixes it.\n\n\nA: I recommend that you go with a VPN Service. You can find a good number of VPN service providers over iTunes, and you don't need encryption after that, as your data will be absolutely secure. Hide My Ass, Astrill etc are good and easy to use VPN services. You can chose to go with any of them.\n", "Q: Use a combining macron in Word 2011 I need to utilize numerals with macrons positioned over them for the mathematical notation involved in the Hermann–Mauguin notation of crystalline space groups.\nOS X has nice Unicode support, so having digits with combining macron is not a problem. See: 4̄ (4 + macron above it; the macron is like a bar).\nHowever, as soon as I try to paste it into Word 2011, it gets displayed incorrectly (the macro is offset to the left, looking somewhat like a superscript: 4–).\nHere's the macron, correctly displayed in UnicodeChecker:\n\nand here's the one pasted into Word:\n\nSo, how can I manage to input/paste combining macrons in Word 2011?\n\nA: First make sure that the macron is available in the font that you use for digits. If a combining mark is taken from a font other than the font of the base character, the result will usually be poor, except by accident. See a list of fonts containing U+0340 (not exhaustive, but useful).\nSecondly, the result still depends on the font and on the rendering software. Word processors haven’t been good at this, though they are getting better. In principle, the rendering software should position the combining mark according to the dimensions of the base character, according to the information that is, or should be, in the font file. In practice, this often fails, resulting in some fixed position. The vertical position tends to be suitable for lowercase letters without ascenders, less suitable (or quite unsuitable) for taller characters, like digits in a typical font.\nIt seems that e.g. for Arial, the placement information in the font is all wrong, resulting in too low position but also badly misplaced to the right. This looks very much like the in the image you included.\nThus, you may need to experiment with fonts to get a reasonable result.  Using most fonts, the rendering is awful or miserable. In my quick test, the following fonts seem to result in acceptable rendering (and they are all free): Charis SIL, DejaVu Sans, Doulos SIL, Gentium Basic, Gentium Book Basic. Update: That was too quick, I tested on a web browser, where I can conveniently get a list of all fonts in my system to try. In Word, even these fonts seem to go wrong.\n", "Q: Export - import iPhone keyboard shortcuts as text file?

Share your experiences on exploring iOS 7 with us..\nWhether you found hidden or little-known feature of iOS 7 or can explain how a big feature makes a difference, we're looking for objective reports of how the new OS affects your workflow.\nAlso provide details on how to achieve that feature, and if possible, include a relevant image too (hold Home and Lock for a screenshot on your iOS device).\n\nPlease post one tip per answer. Please also check to see if your answer has already been posted - duplicate answers will be deleted in favour of the original answer on any given topic. To search answers for this question use inquestion:101382 (or inquestion:this, directly from the question page) in addition to your search terms in the search box in the upper right hand corner of this page.\n\nA: App Store Wish List:\niOS 7 now offers a Wish List within the App Store, where you can keep as many apps bookmarked as you want. Just hit the sharing icon from the top bar on an app’s page, and then select the ‘Add to Wish List’ option. This wish list can then be accessed via the bullet icon in the top-right corner.\n\nA: Audio-Only FaceTime Calls:\niOS 7 brings with it the option to place audio-only FaceTime calls (for the times when you are in no state to make a video call). Go to a contact’s info page, and hit the receiver icon in the FaceTime section. It is possible to turn on video later in an ongoing call.\n\n\nA: iOS 7 keeps tabs on where you hang out most, allowing it to cache relevant nearby data. It’s neat, if a bit spooky. Once you’ve used iOS 7 for a while, go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > System Services to view a list of your frequent haunts. You can also turn this feature off at the same location.\n\nA: Swipe in Safari to go back or forward.\nSwiping one finger from left to right (starting off the left edge of the screen) is the same as hitting the \"back\" button now.\nDoing the same from right to left is the same as the forward button.  This one obviously only works after you've gone back at least once. (For some reason, the \"forward\" one is also a bit less responsive on my device.)\n\nA: Multitasking makes it easier to flip back and forth between 2 apps easily, when you double click the home button to enter the new thumbnailed multitask screen, it always highlights the previously opened application (or the 2nd in the list, as it were) so if you are for example copying multiple items of text from one app to another, you can use the following flow to quickly and repeatedly switch between 2 apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double Click home, hit the center of the screen; this will always return you to the previous app.\n\n*Once you have switched apps in this manner, the order that they appear in changes (basically switching the 1st and 2nd positions around).  Repeating the Double Click home and center tap will flip you back to the first app\n\nA: Activation Lock:\nActivation Lock adds a second layer of protection against tech savvy thieves. Just make sure that Find My iPhone is turned on in the iCloud tab, and if your device ever gets stolen, the thief will not be able to restore or wipe it without disabling Find my iPhone, and for that, he would need to know your Apple ID and password. You can also prevent the device from being reactivated simply by putting it in Lost Mode.\n\n\nA: If you are having trouble reading text on the new backgrounds, you can choose to increase contrast which effects your home bar, lockscreen keys, and more.\n\n\nA: Open tabs in Safari, and tilt your phone to see more content on each tab.\n\nA: Disable Parallax (if desired):\nParallax is iOS 7's new moving home screen. When you tilt your phone, the wallpaper shifts with it. It's a cool parlour trick, but not really useful. It's also incredibly distracting on the larger screen of an iPad. Worse is the fact that disabling it is hidden away. To turn it off head into: Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion. Turn that \"On\" and Parallax is disabled. \n\nA: Search is obtained by swiping down from the middle of a home screen. Swiping from the top edge brings up the notification center as in iOS6. \nI am not sure how my hypothetical grandmother with her hypothetical iPhone is supposed to figure this out though. \n\nA: A minor thing, but blank home screens are now possible for the 1st screen (with the exception of the dock area).  Previously at least 1 app icon was required, but now you can remove them all from the first page - perfect for neatness pedants who love their wallpaper.\n\nA: One method of preserving battery life - Disabling Background Refresh.\niOS 7 lets certain apps refresh even when you're not using them, which is both super convenient and a big problem for users who want the most out of their batteries. Disabling Background Refresh entirely would be your best bet, but even disabling the feature on just a few apps should help your device remain lively for a bit longer.\n\n\nA: iOS7 now tracks data usage in a similar (although not quite as effective way) as Data Sense does on Windows 8 phones.\nTake a peek in Settings > Mobile and scroll down to the MOBILE DATA USAGE section, where you can track how much data has been sent over the mobile data connection (as opposed to WIFI, which isn't tracked).  This is shown as a total of all data, but also on a per app basis, allowing you to see which apps are using most of your bandwidth, and most usefully allowing you to simply deny mobile data access to certain apps without having to shut off your entire connection, which is very very useful for those on expensive data plans, or those of us (like me) who get an allocated amount each month occassionaly get close to going over.\n\nThe figures are shown since the last reset, which is shown at the bottom of the screen (along with the option to perform a statistics reset); unfortunately there is no concept of scheduling a period like with Data Sense where I can say I have 1Gb per month starting on the 15th, for example, but if you remember to manually reset on the first day of your data period, then it's still mighty useful for both keeping you within your limits, and also understanding what is actually using your data.\n\nA: On the weather app, when tapping on the temperature it also gives the humidity, wind, wind  chill etc. \n\nA: Playback controls appear on the lock screen just by waking the phone. This might not sound like a big deal, but I found it to be fantastic. In iOS 6 you needed to double click the home button to display the playback controls on the lock screen. I often carry my iPhone in my breast pocket with headphone cables wound around it. When I want to pause and resume a podcast for a minute, that meant to take it completely out of the pocket to reach the home button and then stuff it and the headphone cable back in. Now I can tap the top power button and reach the controls at the top of the screen right in my pocket, which is fantastic.\nThe controls only seem to stay there for a limited time after playback has been paused. After that they're only reachable by swiping up the control center. \n\nA: Nesting app folders is presently available though this may be considered a bug that Apple will fix in a future iOS7.x.x update\n\n  \n*\n  \n*First, combine two apps to create a folder, and then combine the remaining two apps to create a second folder.\n  \n*Now, hold a finger on one of the folders so that it becomes grayed out.\n  \n*As soon as it does this, press the Home button twice to bring up the multitasking menu. This trick will not work if the apps begin to\n  wiggle (when they enter the organization mode) before you hit the home\n  button. You have about a half a second to get this right.\n  \n*From the multitasking menu, click on the home screen. You should see the folder icon remains enlarged and grayed out, and also that the\n  folders are now wiggling.\n  \n*Now, click the destination folder (the one you want to add the first folder to). You should see the icon of the first folder hovering\n  above.\n  \n*Now, click the Home button once. Ta-da! You now have a folder within a folder. The best part is that these folders work flawlessly,\n  and you can navigate through them, launch apps from within them, and\n  move apps just as you would otherwise.\nYou can use this trick to further nest additional folders, and I've\n  been able to create five folder levels before eventually stopping,\n  though I'm pretty sure you can just keep going until you get bored.\n\nsource: http://www.tuaw.com/2013/09/24/how-to-create-nested-folders-on-ios-7/\n\nA: You can now pinch to change the number of album arts in the Landscape mode of the default music application.\n\n\n\n\nA: Within Messages.app, you can (finally!) check on the exact time every message was sent and received by swiping message bubbles to the left.\nsource: http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741412/the-best-hidden-features-in-ios-7\n\nA: Send an image link via iMessage or email and it includes link as well as a copy of image inline.\n\nA: Open the compass app, and swipe once to the right.

On the client side, I'm on a mac running OS 10.8.4 (late 2012 mac mini). I've googled around extensively on this and came up empty handed. I've used vim for years, and I've never seen problems like this before. \nThe issues all present themselves when I first load the file in vim. I've experienced the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*The top couple of lines are missing. Using arrow keys or the top of file shortcut, I can simply not get to these lines.\n\n*Sometimes, when attempting to delete a character, an entire word or words will be deleted. \n\n*The result of yank and put is inconsistent. Sometimes the line appears correctly, other times all I get is a jarbled mess. \nAm I using the wrong version of vim remotely or some terminal problem specific to Mac OS?\n\nA: I would recommend changing from x-term256color to xterm for your TERM variable as that seems to have resolved my similar issues.\nThe things I saw (in addition to the question's symptoms) are often to have  line over-flow issues within the vi session. That is if I type beyond a certain number of columns then the rest of the text is put onto the next line (i.e. with a new line \\n character in place). This overflowed text is not displayed in the current vi session but I will see it after reopening.\nAnother problem is occasionally the cursor is displayed on one line but I will start editing the next line down..... a real pain when you are writing code!\n", "Q: RDP connection manager for Mac Does anyone know if there are any RDP connection managers similar to Terminals or Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection Manager for the Mac? I'm aware of Royal TSX but $35 seems a bit steep for an RDP client.\nCoRD is my current go-to but it does not allow for organization of connections within folders and is just a big long list. It also ends up always being fuzzy if I don't do full screen with it.\n\nA: iTeleport manages both VNC and RDP connections, and is available on iOS and Mac, as well as Windows even.\nLink to Mac App Store is here.\nIf cost is a consideration, try CoRD.

I have a web page that updates occasionally with new information (I made it myself - simple HTML page - nothing special).\nI regularly have to copy this page to the clipboard on my iOS device to paste its contents into another iOS app. My current strategy is to make it a home screen icon, so I can:\n1) Tap it to launch\n2) Tap and hold on the text to begin selecting\n3) Click 'select all'\n4) Click 'copy'.\nI am wondering if there are any HTML/JS tricks I can enact on the webpage side, or alternatively any apps/iOS tricks I can do on the client side, that would reduce the number of total clicks/steps involved (anything fewer than the four taps above would be a 'win' for me!). If it helps, I always want to copy the page in its entirety.\n\nA: This might be too simple an answer, but using an AppleScript or possibly Automator, or both to automate Safari should do the trick, and you could then use cron to schedule the task for you.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use another video card into iMac 24\" 2008?

Maybe I'm nuts but it seems my iphone 4s switches from normal (audible) mode to vibrate when I put my phone in my pocket.  Anyone else having this weird issue?\n\nA: On the left-hand side of your iPhone is this little switch (ring/silent). The plausible answer to your question is, that you turn the switch on/off by accidentally touching it when you put your phone in your pocket. This happens to me all the time as well.\nWhen the switch is turned from on to off your phone will vibrate one time.\n\nA: It's also plausible that the proximity sensor is switched on and there is a setting tied to it.\n\nA: Well there is a option in settings>Accessibilty>Vibration turn it off to avoid this .Hope this helps\n", "Q: How to migrate from JRE 1.6 to JDK 1.6? My Mac Mountain Lion came with JRE 1.6.  However, I would like to have the full JDK.  I read somewhere that for that on Mac it is better to consult Apple rather than Oracle for downloads/install packages but Apple doesn't seem to offer much support for Java 6 (which I need to work on, can't upgrade to 7).  Better yet, if such an upgrade is available through homebrew.\n\nA: Java JRE and JDKS 1.6 and lower are supplied from Apple and 1.7 or 8 are from Oracle.\nThe latest Apple one is here I think.\nThis installs the JDK and the JRE.\nthe JDK is under /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/ but /usr/bin contains java, javac etc so will be on the path\n", "Q: How to reformat the latest iMac? I need to reformat my work mac. My boss bought it about a month ago, so it's one of the newer ones that didn't come with an installation disc. It's running mountain lion and has a bluetooth keyboard and mouse.\nI tried the CMD-R at startup trick, but it didn't work. Then I looked it up online and read that the new models don't have recovery partition, so you need a disc to reformat it, but I don't have disc!\nI thought about downloading Mountain Lion from the app store and trying the USB drive trick, but the app store doesn't have Mountain Lion in my purchases because it came with the mac! I don't want to pay $30, just to reformat my Mac with something it already has.\nAdvice?\n\nA: Some short tidbits, followed with analysis:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't need to pay for the OS on a Mac that shipped with Lion or Mountain Lion.\n\n*Recovery HD ships with all the above Macs, but it's not visible in Disk Utility and could also be deleted, corrupted, or suffer a hardware failure.\n\n*Internet Recovery will let you re-download a recovery image from Apple's servers even if there is no hard drive connected in your iMac.\n\n*Booting from an external drive with OS X or a Recovery HD or a netboot drive (of which Internet Recovery is one free option) will allow you to totally wipe the entire drive in a Mac.\n\n*Most people are fine using Recovery HD to wipe their Macs as it erases the entire Macintosh HD portion and lest you start cleanly without needing to touch the Recovery HD.\n\n\n\nRather than boot to Command-R, I would boot to the startup chooser (just hold the option key) which should paint a grey screen with both the Macintosh HD and the Recovery HD - letting you choose the second. From there, if you have a fast internet connection (or don't mind waiting), you can use Disk Utility to zero the drive and then reinstall the OS that shipped with your iMac.\n", "Q: How to change cell background color in numbers according to some rules?

This requires that I only have one DHCP server - i.e. that the two routers are seen as a single subnet.\nDoes the configuration above with the Time Capsule in bridge mode result in two DHCP servers or only one (the primary router - Airport Express - whilst the Time Capsule does not act as a DHCP server)?\nThanks.\n\nA: Your setup as described contains one DHCP server on the Airport Express. The Time Capsule in bridge mode basically acts as a repeater and does not assign IP addresses or add a separate subnet.\n", "Q: Microsoft Office, Exchange, Calendar, Snooze issue, Resending Invitation So here is a weird bug, I've created a Reoccurring Meeting in OSX Outlook 2011 but every time I hit snooze using OSX Notifications the Meeting Invite is sent out again with the same time. Why is this happening?\n\nA: I can't confirm that this is a common behavior in Mac Outlook or Calendar. It's working as expected.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nIt's a incompatibility issue with your Exchange Server. e.g. a outdated MS Exchange server version. Somehow your Mac Outlook changes are ignored or not being synced. What Exchange Server version do you use? Also make sure that you are running the latest Mac Outlook Version. \nThe best way is to get in touch with your ISP or Server Administrator, so he/she could take a look at the debug logfiles. \n", "Q: Relative path in Automator I want to make an Automator action that copies a set of files from a folder to another folder that is one folder up and then two folders down from the original files. In other words: ../Folder1/Folder2. The Automator action would be in the same folder as the files, but the root folder will be duplicated and renamed across multiple computers, so the path MUST be relative.\nMy understanding is that I need to run an Applescript to grab the current path and then do...something. I have zero scripting experience. Can anyone help?\n\n\nA: Instead of AppleScript, you could do it by adding a Run Shell Script module with this content:\nfor F in \"$@\"; do\n    cp \"$F\" \"${F%/*/*}/Folder1/Folder2/${F##*/}\"\ndone \n\nEdit the names of Folder1/Folder2 to match your actual case.\nChoose As arguments from the Pass Input: pop-up at right where it says to stdin.\n$@ stores the full path of all files selected. $F is each individual file's path as it is processed by the for loop. The weird ${F%/*/*} is the full path of the file minus the file name and its parent folder name. The weird ${F##*/} is the file name itself.\nTest first for safety!\n\nThe other way to do it, which I think would be easier in the long run:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window.\n\n*Type cdspace and drag the folder containing your files into the window. (This will paste in the path to that folder. Be sure to include the space after cd before you drag-and-drop.)\n\n*Type cp *Video* ../Folder1/Folder2\n\n*Done!\n\n\nA: UPDATE* trimmed down the code a little bit, and corrected the path\nSince you asked for applescript…\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set thefolderPath to \"folder1:folder2:\"\n        set mycontainer to (path to me)\n            set movePath to folder thefolderPath of container of (path to me)'s container as alias\n        duplicate input to movePath\n\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\nThis also does away with the copy action since the duplication is done here also.\n\nUPDATE 2\nWith this version. It does not matter where the App is. The path is worked out by where the files are.\non run {input, parameters}\n    set thefolderPath to \"folder1:folder2:\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set thisItem to item 1 of input as alias\n         set movePath to folder thefolderPath of container of (thisItem)'s container as alias\n        duplicate input to movePath\n\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\n\nUPDATE 3\nThis version is the same as update 2.

Several people are saying on this site and other sites that they have been able to get service for their Verizon iPhone 4 (with contract fulfilled already) on either Straight Talk or Page Plus.  But when I call both companies, they say they can not activate any Verizon iPhones.  \nWhy the contradictory info?  How can I take my money (less of it hopefully) elsewhere? I  barely even use the thing, so spending the $80 plus a month with Verizon is not acceptable any more (and my 2 year contract is up).\n\nA: The iPhone 4 built for Verizon's network is a CDMA-only device that is not capable of operating on a GSM network that requires a SIM card, such as StraightTalk (which uses T-Mobile's network). That said, Page Plus operates on Verizon so there shouldn't be any impediment assuming you've had the phone unlocked already.\nThis thread indicates that Page Plus phone reps are hit-or-miss when it comes to allowing you to use an iPhone. About halfway down the page there are steps for doing so online, thereby avoiding the troublesome CSRs.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Activate online. This costs $10.\n  \n*Wait (10) minutes, then dial *22890.

I've got the prefixes in a CSV file (or spreadsheet) and I'm wondering if there's a way that I can have Automator (or some other automation) program duplicate the image but rename the image with the different prefixes.\nI'm aware of how to duplicate multiple images with the same prefix but is it possible to duplicate one image multiple times with different prefixes.

But .rtf file I create just give me the error \n\"The document “foo.rtf” could not be opened.\"\nWhat am I doing wrong? Are you not able to create files in this manner?\n\nA: As you've likely discovered, touching a nonexistent file will create a zero-byte file with the name you specify.  (touch is also used to update the modification time on an existing file.  See man touch for further details.)\nThe problem you're running into is that though a completely empty file is valid HTML, text, or Markdown, it is not valid RTF—this is true of many file formats, actually, which are structured in a particular way and require some data to be present be valid.\nBased on my experimentation, the bare minimum RTF file appears to be\n{\\rtf1}\n\nIf you'd like to create a blank RTF file from the shell, try this:\necho '{\\rtf1}' >Foo.rtf \n\nNote the above will overwrite Foo.rtf if it exists.\n", "Q: What percentage of Mac users have OSX Lion or higher?

I did a custom installation of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac on my MacBook Air running 10.8.4., but I changed my mind and decided to uninstall it.\nI only installed Word, Excel, and Proofing Tools (English only).\nI'm reading up on how to fully remove all the tidbits Microsoft sprinkled about, and I noticed a couple files on my system:\n/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/SharePointBrowserPlugin.plugin\n/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/SharePointWebKitPlugin.webplugin\n\nI didn't include SharePoint in the installation, so I'm not sure that's where these files came from. It's a new machine, so the only alternative is that they were included with OS X 10.8.4, in which case I'm inclined to leave them be.\nDoes anybody know more about these files, where they likely came from?\n\nA: Those two files are not part of Apple's installed software on 10.8.4.\nI would chalk it up to Microsoft's installer.\nYou can research this in depth with a tool like Pacifist by http://www.charlessoft.com\n", "Q: Remove author metadata from PDF annotations in preview? I need to provide comments on PDFs as part of the refereeing process for journal articles.  How can I remove my name from the annotations I've made using Mac Preview?  (they can be seen in Inspector: Annotations, but seem not to be editable)\n\nA: In Preview, go to preferences\nIn the PDF tab\nSelect show or Not show the name in the Annotations !\n\n\nA: MetaClean is a powerful tool to view, remove and edit metadata of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Visio), OpenOffice (word processors, spreadsheets and presentations) and PDF (versions 1.0 and higher) documents.\nhttp://adarsus.com/en/metaclean.html\nMicrosoft Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS X Platforms\n\nA: Regarding the second answer, this does not necessarily work if the .pdf was created using a different application, even if it is modified in Preview. Always use the Inspector in Preview to make sure the Author metadata is anonymized, and if not, change it as the first answer suggests using a text editor (TextEdit works fine).\nFor example, I often \"print\" web pages to .pdf in Safari, particularly news stories. If I open one of those in Preview and look using Inspector, my name shows up, even though I have \"Add name to annotations\" unchecked in Preview preferences as the second answer suggests. It stays there even if I annotate the document in Preview and save it.\nI assume this is because it was added when I printed to .pdf from Safari. Safari preferences do not have a way to change user ID or anonymize saved documents in its preferences, as far as I can tell, so it reverts to System-level account information and adds my name from there when saving.\nAgain, always use the Inspector in Preview to make sure the Author metadata is anonymized before sending out a sensitive document.\n(This should answer keflavich's question in response to Answer 2. In Preview [as opposed to common office applications or other groupware], your name is not associated with your annotations but with the document as a whole.)\n\nA: I have the exact same problem.

I'm uninstalling Microsoft Office 2011 from a rather new MacBook running 10.8.4, and Microsoft's website says to delete (among others) all files beginning with com.microsoft located in /private/var/db/receipts/.\nI've read that in general it's inadvisable to delete such files (.bom's and .plist's) from your receipts folder willy-nilly, since it could affect other software or the OS. But since I'm not running any other Microsoft software on this machine, and since Microsoft recommends deleting them, I suppose it's safe in this case.\nHowever, I found what appear to be duplicates of those files (same names, permissions, sizes, etc.) located in /var/db/receipts/, which Microsoft's site doesn't mention.

I tried a number of times, changing the service from \"BTGuard VPN\" to \"Tunnelblick VPN\" to \"BTGuard\", etc., without success. I keep getting this notice from Applescript:\n\"Can't get <<class svce>> \"btguard\" of <<class locc>> of <<class netp>> of application \"System Events\".\n\nI am running Mac 10.8.4 and am using BTGuard's Open VPN service via the Tunnelblick app. Also, my OS can't hide the extension, thus it appears as an app.\n\nA: \"System Events\" is an Apple-supplied function. It can only be used to start a VPN that is the type of VPN built into OS X -- an \"L2TP over IPSec\" or \"PPTP\", or \"Cisco IPSec\" VPN.\nTunnelblick is used to start/stop/manage an \"OpenVPN\" VPN, which is different. (That is why you need Tunnelblick to use the VPN -- OS X does not include software to handle an OpenVPN-based VPN.)\nTunnelblick itself has an option to start when the computer starts -- on the \"Settings\" tab of the \"Configurations\" panel of the \"VPN Details...\" window, there is a setting named \"Connect\". The default setting is \"Manually\", but you can set it to connect \"When Tunnelblick launches\" or \"When computer starts\".\nThe \"When computer starts\" setting will only be available if the configuration is what Tunnelblick calls a \"Shared\" configuration, or if the version of Tunnelblick you have is what is called a \"Deployed\" version (with the configurations built into the application).\nIf you have a \"Private\" configuration, you can change it to \"Shared\" (and thus enable the \"When computer starts\" setting) by selecting the configuration in the list on the left, then clicking the little \"gear\" icon at the bottom of the list, then clicking \"Make Configuration Shared...\"\nEven with \"When computer starts\" selected, there is a time during the computer startup when the VPN has not been established but network operations take place (among other things, to start the VPN!), so there is network traffic that is not sent through the VPN. If you are trying to make sure nobody can \"eavesdrop\" on your network connection, this brief time period is a time when they can.\nFor that reason, few people use the \"When computer starts\" option -- and it could be buggy (I speak as the developer/maintainer of Tunnelblick). It is likely that selecting \"When Tunnelblick launches\" and have Tunnelblick launch when you log in will be sufficient for your needs. Tunnelblick will launch when you log in if it is running when you log out (or shut down or restart). And when it launches, it will start the VPN if it is set to \"When Tunnelblick launches\".\nIf you have further questions about using Tunnelblick, please use Tunnelblick's Discussion Group for questions -- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tunnelblick-discuss.\n", "Q: When will PHP 5.4 appear in default OS X installations?

If you want to do the historical research yourself, you can have a look at Apple Open Source which includes all the open source packages in OS X since 10.0.\n", "Q: Is my hard drive starting to fail? My MacBook Pro (mid-2012, 16GB, i7 2.3) has started to misbehave:\n\n\n*\n\n*very slow to start up and shut down\n\n*application launches are slow\n\n*system becomes nearly unusable when \"free\" memory approaches zero.\n\n\nDisk Utility is showing SMART status of the drive as \"verified\". However, Blackmagic Disk Speed Test is showing a read speed of 27 MB/s and a write speed of 25.7 MB/s. This seems slow to me, though I'm have trouble finding any benchmark values to compare against.\nI've run \"verify disk\" in the Disk Utility app twice. The first time it completed with no errors. The second time the computer froze before the procedure finished.\nHere is the system profiler information for the drive.\nCapacity:   500.11 GB (500,107,862,016 bytes)\n  Model:    APPLE HDD HTS547550A9E384               \n  Revision: JE3AD70F\n  Serial Number:          J226008BJ65LKC\n  Native Command Queuing:   Yes\n  Queue Depth:  32\n  Removable Media:  No\n  Detachable Drive: No\n  BSD Name: disk0\n  Rotational Rate:  5400\n  Medium Type:  Rotational\n  Partition Map Type:   GPT (GUID Partition Table)\n  S.M.A.R.T. status:    Verified\n  Volumes:\ndisk0s1:\n  Capacity: 209.7 MB (209,715,200 bytes)\n  BSD Name: disk0s1\n  Content:  EFI\nMacintosh HD:\n  Capacity: 499.25 GB (499,248,103,424 bytes)\n  Available:    101.87 GB (101,868,064,768 bytes)\n  Writable: Yes\n  File System:  Journaled HFS+\n  BSD Name: disk0s2\n  Mount Point:  /\n  Content:  Apple_HFS\n  Volume UUID:  BBF6F6B8-26B8-39B4-A206-81471EA7F2B2\nRecovery HD:\n  Capacity: 650 MB (650,002,432 bytes)\n  BSD Name: disk0s3\n  Content:  Apple_Boot\n  Volume UUID:  DB9ED89F-80DF-3A80-BCC4-58DF1F234256\n\nDoes any of this indicate an imminent drive failure? The AppleCare plan for this computer expires in 6 days.\n\nA: There is no harm in getting a call logged before your apple care expires, although from your description nothing you say would suggest to me that the hard drive is at fault.  It sounds more like the slow build up of unwanted startup items, and inevitable disk fragmentation is just slowing things down, or you could plain be out of memory more often than before.  If you have a secure backup, I might consider a couple of things to test:\n1) Create a new user, and see if it is as slow as your usual user account\n2) From a complete backup, format your drive and restore to defrag the drive, and again see if the same happens.\nHD problems would usually manifest themselves in unusual noises, clicks and whirs, repeated attempts to load a file, genuine errors in log files where you could use the Console app to search for things like \"disk0s\" \"error\" and \"I/O error\" - especially if they correlate in time to the slowness or freezing you are seeing.\n\nA: From the information provided it does not look like hard drive problem.\nTo verify what is going on use the:\nActivity monitor to see who is hugging the CPU\nand use the Console to see who is doing what\nthose 2 will tell you more about why is your computer slow.\nMeanwhile since you running out of warranty time, call the support anyway.\n\nA: You say: \n\nsystem becomes nearly unusable when \"free\" memory approaches zero.\n\nThat is absolutely normal. Without memory nothing moves. The problem is why you get short of memory? Look inside the Preferences>>user>>login elements and get rid of all background program you do not need. Makes sure you never run too low on memory closing apps that you do not use and check if this makes your mac happy again.\n", "Q: Find out which network user is using a file, causing \"The operation can’t be completed because the item ... is in use\" So, normally, if you run into the error \"The operation can’t be completed because the item ... is in use\" while trying to modify a file, you look up what is using the file with sudo lsof | grep <filename or part of filename>.\nI'm having a problem where this doesn't work. The file in question is on a shared network drive (Active Desktop I believe, or something like that). The file is not in use on my machine - the above lsof Terminal command gives nothing. So it seems that something else on the network is causing the file to be in use.\nNothing I've tried (lsof, Get Info, rebooting, force-quitting Finder, opening the file in its own application...) helps or gives any clue about why it's locked like this. \nHow can I find out who or what on the network is using a particular file?\n\nBackground for my specific case: for me, the file in question is one of those hidden ~$whatever.xlsx or ~$whatever.xlmx 'ghost' temporary files that Excel for Mac likes to create, which cause Excel files to become uneditable when people inevitably disconnect from the network without closing Excel.\nNormally, the easy fix is to delete the ghost file. This normally works fine - but at the moment it's not working with the above error and there's no clue I can see why not.\nAlso, normally, opening Excel files that are locked by a user gives a message like \"Locked for editting by <username>\". There's no such message for this, which is unusual (but maybe just Excel for Mac being glitchy, probably not related to the general question).\nOn a Mac Pro running Lion (Excel for Mac 2011 in case that is relevant).\n\nA: I have often been able to delete otherwise not deletable files by deleting the file in Terminal:\nsudo rm /path/to/the/file/to/delete\nWithout sudo it still fails for me but ad it and files vanish like magic. If you don't know the specific unix file path just type \"sudo rm \" and then drag the file into the open Terminal window and it will insert the file.\nPress ENTER, authenticate with your admin password and the file SHOULD vanish.\n", "Q: Disabling \"modal sheets\" in OS X In OS X, modal dialogues are displayed as \"sheets\" that drop down from the top of the window. In many cases this is nice, but occasionally I find it really annoying. Consequently, although it's a long shot, I thought I'd ask whether anyone knows a way to either disable these modal sheets entirely, or to detach a sheet so that it becomes a proper window.\nThe reason I want this is that I often have many (unsaved and untitled) documents open in TextEdit and other applications, with short notes that I've made. When I shut down my computer it asks me whether I want to save each of them, but if there's only a few lines of text then the modal sheet completely covers it, so I can't see what's in the document. This means I have to cancel the dialogue, which cancels the shutdown, then go though and manually save everything.\nSo although it's nice to have modal dialogues attached to the window they're associated with, I'd really appreciate a way to move them out of the way to see what's underneath, if one exists.\n\nA: I highly doubt you can change the appearance of sheets, even through undocumented means – that's been a core part of OS X since 10.0.\nThat said, I think there's a way to effectively avoid the problem you're having: in System Preferences, go to General and uncheck the box for \"Ask to keep changes when closing documents\".\n\nNow, apps that support auto-save (like TextEdit) won't bug you about unsaved changes when they quit – they'll simply save the changes in the background automatically, then restore them when you next launch the app.\n(Note: I think the above option is only available on Mountain Lion).\n", "Q: OS X Terminal: \"backward delete word\" works only with C-M-h Followup on Mac OS X Terminal: Map option+delete to “backward delete word”.\nThe Use option key as meta key option is checked, but the deleting word backwards works only with ^-⌥-H (i.e. one has to also hold the ^ or Control key)!

crashing in the video kext (com.apple.GeForce). It is probably a bug in Firefox or a FireFox extension. You could try switching browsers, or disable all of your FireFox extensions and see if it goes away. If it does, slowly re-enable the extensions (1 per day at the fastest) to see when it starts happening again.\n\nA: This seems to be an issue with older Macs and Firefox 26 and going back to Version 25 seems to help.\n\nReverting back to Firefox 25 has resolved the issue on the iMac.\n\nSource: https://support.mozilla.org/de/questions/984953\n", "Q: How to diagnose connection timeouts when connecting to a WiFi hotspot I am having difficulty troubleshooting this error message:\n\nI don't get any indication any details about the failed connection attempt. \nHow can I diagnose such timeouts and resolve the connection issue?\nI am aware of and have tried methods like rest your airport, reset the computer, delete profiles, down to install new operating system and rather than have people guess (and then vote for) specific causes like has happened on this thread, I'd like to know how to pick apart the connection process to know where the problem lies.\nWhen I successfully connect, system information has excellent details:\n\nHowever, without changing anything, at a later time, I will time out again when joining. Can I see the details of the process for the connection and find what is making it fail? What would it take to create or access a log file of the wifi connection process?\n\nA: Don't have the solution but have interesting observation!!\nMy WiFi scan shows the SSID that I want to connect to\n\nand in Terminal the Airport -s shows same SSID\n\nI was monitoring the Console during the event.\n\nThe Associate event still shows the Correct SSID\n<airportd[535]> associate: INFO: airportd associate: network=<CWNetwork: 0x7fec12802ce0> [ssid=Eurona900850808-81, bssid=02:0c:42:39:95:94, security=Open, rssi=-80, channel=<CWChannel: 0x7fec12802cf0> [channelNumber=7(2GHz), channelWidth={20MHz}], ibss=0], is8021X=0, remember=1\n\nAfter few lines of other WiFi activity this comes up:\n<kernel> Searching for networks with ssid Eurona900850808-8\n\nWAIT: where did the last digit go, it supposed to be the Eurona900850808-81, but it shows Eurona900850808-8\nHere is the rest from the Console:\nFri Sep 13 23:22:55.92  <kernel> Searching for networks with ssid Eurona900850808-8\nFri Sep 13 23:22:57.488 <kernel> No networks found.

I ran airportd logger and got :\n associate: Apple80211Associate2() failed with error -3905\nI found that this was due to the fact that I was using WPA to attempt to connect to a 802.11n network that was previously undiscovered. I also kept getting :\n Received Disassoc from 00:02:6f:e6:ee:a0 with Reason 14\nI've found nothing documenting either airportd error codes or kernel Disassoc Reason 14, anyway.\nWhen I manually added the network to my preferred networks and set the security to WPA2 Personal, it found and connected to the network.\n", "Q: Hard drive will not format - bad drive or enclosure? Today, I received from Amazon a Thermaltake BlacX 5G hard drive docking station and a 2 TB Western Digital Green drive. I inserted the drive and was able to format it into a one partition drive. \nI then started a clone backup in SuperDuper which stopped when the drive seemed to eject itself. I reinserted the drive and was told it was not formatted. I began to reformat it and received the \"File System Formatter Failed\" error message. I rebooted, tried the docking station on a different USB port, etc. None of it worked.\nI then tried to format the drive via terminal and received the following:\nAndyMBP:dev andy$ diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ clone disk3\nStarted erase on disk3\nUnmounting disk\nError: -69760: Unable to write to the last block of the device\nAndyMBP:dev andy$ \n\nWhat I am trying to figure out is whether I have a bum drive or a bum docking station. Is there a way to determine this short of buying another drive? Everything is under warranty, but I want to make sure I return the correct item.\n\nA: Try using some other means of connecting to the drive other than the Thermalake docking station. I had the same problem with one awhile back. I ended up using a plain ol' SATA to USB cable and that fixed my problem.\n", "Q: Finder Window List Mode not displaying properly I'm having a problem with, as far as I can tell a single folder (~/Pictures) in the Finder's List View mode. When I navigate to other folders they display normally, it is only my Pictures folder that is wrong.\nThe issues are:\n\n\n*\n\n*The header is not being displayed in the standard way\n\n*The folders do not have a disclosure triangle to see its contents.\n\n\nI have tried deleting the folder's .DS_Store and .localized files and restarting the Finder, repairing Disk Permissions with Disk Utility, and finally cold booting the machine. \nI'm at a loss as to what could be causing this.\nMy machine is a MacBookPro w/Retina running 10.8.4.\n\nNotice that the column headers are being drawn differently and the disclosure triangle to the left of the folder names is missing.\n\nA: You can show the disclosure triangles in list view by opening the View Options (⌘ cmd + J) and changing the Arrange By to None.\nSetting this also allows you to click on a header to set the sort order like SL's headers. A 'sort triangle' will be shown.\n\n\nA: Having a \"sort triangle\" instead of the (snow-leopord, at least) \"column highlight\" I think is a step backward.  Sure, it looks more like the iOS, but it's a step backward in terms of being able to quickly see the sorted-status of a folder (just glance at the color. (My guess - though just a guess - is that \"color v. B/W\" recognition by the human eye is probably a bit faster than shape-recognition - if it's colored, it's sorted; if not, it's not).\nAs well, there's the question of accessibility for people who have trouble seeing small things.  The iOS is also full of these small-interface-widgets - particularly troubling for people who have normal-to-big sized figertips...\nAs for the  disclosure triangles disappearing when the Sort is set to anything other than None - my guess is this has to do with the question of \"what to do with 'second level' items\".  Do you sort the first-level, and not sort the contents of any \"open\" folders in the list at all?  Or sort the first-level and second-level separately (with the same sort-by-criteria?  What if the child-folder has a different sort-by criteria by default?)\nMy (totally uninformed) guess is it is some unintended consequence of how Core Data works internally.  I'm guessing Core Data is basically ALL of what allows Spotlight searching, and is also used by the Finder in it's views as well.\n", "Q: What are the blue dots next to App names in iOS and macOS? They disappear once you open the apps and then return to the home screen, but I can't tell what they indicate.\nAre they apps that haven't been opened since an app update? Or that it thinks have never been opened (not accurate in my case, but that could be a function of a \"restore\" confusing the phone).\n\n\n\nA: The blue dot is the replacement to the banner that iOS 6 had for a new app.\n\nThere are two conditions for a banner being shown:\n\n\n*\n\n*an app has been downloaded from the App Store but has not been opened yet\n(a restore from iTunes/iCloud will also cause an app to be classed as 'New')\n\n*an app has been updated but has not been opened since it has been updated\n(this counts for manually updated apps or apps that have been automatically updated by iOS 7's new background app updater). \nAs soon as the app is opened, the dot is removed.\n\nA: that means they are new. as in \"unopened since last update\"\n\nA: They indicate that the app was recently updated and has not yet been launched since the update.\nThe pale blue dot will appear either if iOS 7 updated the app with Automatic Updates or if the user updated it manually.\nIn iOS 6, when you installed a new app, its icon would display a small \"new\" banner across one corner. In iOS 7, new apps are represented by a blue dot.\nThat dot also appears when you update an existing app (or the OS updates it for you in the background). In both cases, the dot disappears after you launch that app for the first time.\nhttp://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57603848-233/five-quick-ios-7-mysteries-solved/\n", "Q: What's the difference between the battery of iPhone 5s vs iPhone 5? Do they have the same capacity and/or run time for certain identical tasks?\nI know iPhone 5's battery has a charge capacity of 1440mAh. Has this been improved in the new iPhone 5s and/or iPhone 5c?\n\nA: There are slight improvements to the battery capacities of the 5S and 5C over the 5.\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 5 - 1440mAh <- 5.45Whr at 3.8V\n\n*iPhone 5c - 1508mAh <- 5.73Whr at 3.8V\n\n*iPhone 5s - 1558mAh <- 5.92Whr at 3.8V\n\n\nSource\n\nIn terms of battery life comparison for 5 vs. 5c vs. 5s, they ran some benchmarks in their review.  In some tasks the 5c/5s are better than the 5, in others the 5 is better.  With the exception of their Wifi browsing test, the new phones are comparable to the 5, with there being less than an hour difference in battery life.  In the Wifi browsing test though, the new phones ran out of juice .57 hours sooner (5c) and 1.3 hours sooner (5s).\n\nA: During the keynote, Phil Schiller stated that the battery on the iPhone 5C was slightly larger than the battery on the current iPhone 5, and the Apple iPhone compare page states the same battery life for the 5C and the 5S, so I suspect they may have the same battery.\n", "Q: Access OS X Mail message by its ID I am trying (unsuccessfully) to get a Mail message (located in the 'Drafts' folder) by its message id.\nThe following code:\nset theContent to getContent(123456)\n\non getContent(theID)\n\n  tell application \"Mail\"       \n    try\n      return ((content of message whose message id is theID) as rich text)\n    on error errText number errNum\n      display dialog \"Error: \" & errNum & return & errText\n    end try\n\n  end tell\n\nend getContent\n\nGenerates an error that reads: Error -1723.

For example, I want to be able to write \"organize colours\" without my Mac from underlining one of those words as a spelling error (whilst also recognising that the way I just spelled recognize was an error, as old habits die hard).\nNeither the British nor American spelling options in the system preferences can do this, and it is just ever so slightly infuriating that a Mac that uses the Oxford Dictionary as its spelling dictionary will not use said dictionary's preferred spelling!\n\nA: LibreOffice's British English dictionary has support for Oxford English. You can download the .dic and .aff files from https://github.com/ropensci/hunspell/tree/master/inst/dict and place the files in ~/Library/Spelling – either manually, or using the terminal:\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/hunspell/master/inst/dict/en_GB.aff -O ~/Library/Spelling/en_GB.aff\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/hunspell/master/inst/dict/en_GB.dic -O ~/Library/Spelling/en_GB.dic\n\nThen log out and log in again, or restart your machine.\nYou should now be able to go to your keyboard preferences (Apple menu → System Preferences…), choose the Text tab and enable the new dictionary under Spelling. It should be called “British English (Library)”:\n\nHere's a screenshot of a Safari text field spell checked with this dictionary:\n\nP.S: If you choose to enable auto-detection of the language used for spell checking, it doesn't seem to use these “Library” dictionaries, so you might need to right click in text fields, open Spelling and grammar and explicitly set the language to British English (Library) to get it to work.\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 5s physically similar enough to the iPhone 5 to use a close fitting case? I wonder if there is any reason why a close fitting iPhone 5 case wouldn't also fit the iPhone 5s? It would be helpful to know whether the cutout for the camera or the various buttons (mute switch, sleep, volume) and lightning connector are close enough for hard cases to fit between the models (or vice versa).\n\nA: Per Ars Technica:\n\n\"Every measurement, right down to the 3.95 ounce weight and 0.30-inch thickness, is identical to the iPhone 5.\"\n\nVisually from looking at photos the ports, buttons, etc. are all identically placed. Also, one of the image captions in that article:\n\n\"The leather cases for the iPhone 5S will also fit the iPhone 5. This should also hopefully mean that third-party cases for the iPhone 5 will continue to fit the 5S.\"\n\nThe only possible issue would be the iPhone 5 LED flash vs the 5s' dual-LED flash. But as long as the cut-out on the third-party case looks like Apple's does (i.e. it goes around the camera and the LED in one cut-out), there shouldn't be any reason they don't fit.\n", "Q: PostScript questions on Macs with either Preview or Macghostview 1)  The PC implementation of Ghostview has a \"Safer\" option, checked by default, that prevents file creation (so that running a .ps file can't hurt anything in the environment).  One must uncheck \"Safer\" to run PostScript files that create files or one gets an invalidfileaccess error.  \nWhat is the equivalent of unchecking \"Safer\" in either or both of the OSX PostScript viewers mention in the title?\n2)  If a PostScript program contains an error, where to Preview put (hide?!?!) the error message?\n\nA: I just started using MacGhostView and I have hand-generated .ps files that run other .ps files using the run command. I get Error: /invalidfileaccess in --run-- in a message window. By default the SAFER option for ghostscript is usually enabled in all versions of GhostView, which this app is based on. It is a security precaution that prevents a script from reading/writing from/to a file. I tried adding the -dNOSAFER option, which is what you would use with ghostscript, to Preferences->gv parameters but it didn't work. Looking through all the menu items, I finally found Options->Show gv parameters which displayed the options for this app. The -dNOSAFER option is replaced by -nosafer in this app. I don't know why they would change any of the options from the original syntax but all of them are like this. I added this option to Preferences->gv parameters and now I can open all my files. I also added -media=LETTER and -resize (separated by spaces) so by default I get a letter-size canvas within a fit window.\nI can't open my .ps files that violate the SAFER option in Preview because there is no way to change the options in the app. The ones that do not violate this option seem to be converted to pdf before being displayed. I much prefer MacGhostView.\n", "Q: Logged on to someone elses IPad I borrowed my friends iPad recently and logged her out of the apple store and logged in using my own apple id.  I did download a range of free apps using my own apple id.  After this I logged out of the apple store and gave the ipad back.  Ever since this though my friend keeps being asked for my password although she is logged in to the icloud and the store.  She is unable to download any apps without being asked to log in as me.\nAny ideas on how I can fix this?\n\nA: You (or your friend) will need to delete all the apps you downloaded to your friend's iPad. The iPad is likely attempting to download updates to the apps you downloaded with your Apple ID, which your friend cannot do with her AppleID.\nThere's no great harm in leaving your apps on the device other than they won't back up for your friend and the nagging password prompt.\nIf your friend wants to clear out all of your apps in one step, they can back up to iTunes, transferring all purchases and then restoring the device. No apps locked to your password will make the jump to the backup and your friend will be left with the device cleaned of all of your apps.\n", "Q: Terminal CMD + SHIFT + Left/Right Brace No Longer Works I'm using Terminal and don't know if this has been an issue after upgrading to Mountain Lion, or whether I made a configuration change that had a side effect that I didn't realize. When I use the CMD + SHIFT + ] or CMD + SHIFT + [ keys, the mac beeps at me instead of switching the tab I'm using in Terminal.\nIs there a way to remap this sequence? Where would I look?\nNote, I can use CMD + SHIFT + ] / [ to shift tabs in Safari and Chrome, so this only happens in Terminal. (I also noticed that CMD + 1, shifts desktops instead of shifting to a particular tab; I'm okay with that not operating as I would expect since I don't use that shortcut).\nNote, I have switched my CMD & ALT keys on my keyboard, but if I use a keyboard without these switched, I get the same behavior.\n\nA: Edit: Disregard the first part. [ Is the shift of { so we were saying the same thing different ways. I'm leaving this here though regarding disabling the Mission Control shortcuts.\nThe sequence to cycle forward through tabs is ⌘+shift+}, despite what the Window menu says. (⌘+} switches between windows. Very odd.) And ⌘+shift+{ cycles backward.\n\n(You should also be able to reclaim ⌘+1, ⌘+2, etc. to switch windows in Terminal, which is what the Window menu says those shortcuts do, by going to System Preferences > Keyboard and disabling the keyboard shortcuts that use cmd+ a number under Mission Control. I haven't tested this though.)\n\n", "Q: What is Safari Safe Browsing Data and why does it need to copy every time I sync my iDevice? Whenever syncing iDevices to iTunes, I always see \"Safari Safe Browsing Data\" being copied. This naturally sounds alarming. Is Apple tracking my browsing history‽\nWhat exactly is it, and why does it need to copy every time?\n\nA: Google Safe Browsing Data Syncs to iOS Devices Via iTunes explains what it is:\n\nThis database, provided by Google, is used by mobile Safari to check for known malicious web sites. To check if this is activated on your iOS device, go to Settings > Safari, then look for the Fraud Warning slider. If it’s not set to “On,” do so; it’s a good way to protect your device and yourself from known malicious websites.\n\n\nA: Go on your iPod to\nSETTINGS > SAFARI > FRAUD WARNING and if it's turned on, turn it off. Then go to ADVANCED > WEBSITE DATA click edit, scroll to the bottom and click remove all website data. Turn FRAUD WARNING on again and you are ready to go.\n", "Q: Prevent switching workspaces when clicking on dock icon I am constantly running multiple applications on multiple workspaces. I want to remain on the same workspace, and only switch workspaces when I explicitly ask for it (e.g. with a magic mouse gesture).\nCurrently when I click on the app icon in the dock, osx switches to the next workspace that has a window of the active application.\nI know there is an option in System Preferences -> Misson Control, called \"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application\". What it does: When clicking on the icon of an inactive application, don't switch to a workspace that has the application window. But this option does not affect the behaviour of clicking on an active application.\n\nThe question: How do I prevent OSX from ever switching to another wokspace when clicking on an app icon in the dock, regardless of whether the app is active of inactive?\n\nA: Unlike the original questioner, I was trying to enable this effect. I wanted to switch between spaces where applications lived on different desktops. \nI just took a guess at: \ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool TRUE\n\nand\nkillall Dock\n\nThe two commands above worked like a charm to restore the effect.\n\nA: Note that there is a relevant setting in later versions of MacOS when using the app switcher (cmd+tab), but that doesn't work when clicking on the app icon in the Dock (so it doesn't solve the OPs question):\nSystem Preferences > Mission Control > \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\"\n\nA: Open Terminal.app, then run the following commands.  \nChange the default workspace preference:  \n\ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO  \n\nNext, restart the Dock with this command:\n\nkillall Dock\n\nReferences:\nHow can I disable auto-switching desktops?\nDisable Space switching on Command-Tab\n", "Q: What is the purpose of \"~/.adobe\" directory?

(Currently clicking on the dock icon of an active app switches to the next workspace that has a window of the app.)\nIs there a way to bring to top all windows of the active application?\nEDIT: Seems there's a Window -> Bring All to Front action that does this. Now I only need a way to trigger this action, preferably when the app icon in the dock is clicked.\nThird party command solutions (e.g. some simple keyboard shortcut app to run the Bring All to Front action) are welcome, though I'd prefer a native way of doing this.\n\nA: You can assign a keyboard shortcut to the \"Bring All to Front\" menu item from System Preferences:\n\nLate note\nThis isn't there by default, you have to add it manually, the same as any other menu command…\n\nThe activate AppleScript command also raises all windows:\nactivate application (path to frontmost application as text)\n\nIf you are assigning keyboard shortcuts to opening applications, you can use scripts like this:\ntell application \"TextEdit\"\n    reopen\n    activate\nend tell\n\nreopen opens a new default window if there are no open \"default\" windows, like a text editor window in TextEdit. If all default windows are minimized, reopen unminimizes one of them.\nIt is also possible to use AppleScript to click the \"Bring All to Front\" menu item:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell (process 1 where frontmost is true)\n    click menu item \"Bring All to Front\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Window\" of menu bar 1\nend tell\n\n\nA: I use ⌘ Command~ to cycle windows of currently selected application.\nMacOS Mojave. \n\nA: Brining all of an app's windows to the front when clicking a single background window was a behavior of \"classic\" Mac OS:\n\nhttp://hypercritical.co/2020/01/08/front-and-center\n\nIn classic, when you click on a window that belongs to an application that’s not currently active, all the windows that belong to that application come to the front. In Mac OS X (and macOS), only the window that you click comes to the front.\nMy particular style of window management leans heavily on the classic behavior. I also appreciate the Mac OS X behavior in certain circumstances, so I was delighted to find apps that enable both behaviors, using Shift-click to override the default.\nSadly, macOS Catalina’s lack of support for 32-bit apps finally killed the last of the apps that implemented this feature. I was alone in a cold, barren world where I had to click on a Dock icon to switch to an app and bring all its windows to the front.\n\n\nSiracusa released a 64-bit app, Front and Center, to bring the \"classic\" behavior to modern versions of macOS that dropped 32-bit support.\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/front-and-center/id1493996622?ls=1&mt=12\n\nFront and Center lets you control the window layering policy on your Mac. In \"Classic\" mode, clicking on a window brings all the windows in that app to the front, just like it did in classic Mac OS. In \"Modern\" mode, only the clicked window comes to the front. In either mode, Shift-click on a window to get the opposite of the chosen behavior.\n\n\nA: In the interest of internet archaeology I provide this additional information:\nBack in the OS X 10.4 \"Tiger\" days there used to be a PowerPC-only program called \"Application Switcher Menu\" (ASM) that was hosted at the now defunct http://www.vercruesse.de/software and had the ability to bring all windows of an application to the front when any individual window was brought forward. The source code for that application was eventually published by the creator, which allowed a free successor program to be created; multiXFinder. It too was PPC-only.\nFor Intel-based Macs, some currently available commercial choices include DragThing by James Thomson (that works up through OS X 10.12 Sierra at least) and SuperTab by SpriTec Software (untested by me but the homepage claims it's compatible through 10.13 High Sierra). Both of these products include a \"bring all application windows to the front\" feature that is tangential to their primary purposes.\n", "Q: How do I stop a freezing Chrome? I tried Esc+Opt+Cmd, then selected Chrome and Force stop.\nThe name of the application dissapeared from that menu, but it was still freezed.\nAfter 10 minutes I tried to reboot, but the computer were waiting for the application to close. In the end I pressed the power button for a couple of seconds to force the shutdown. Can I kill a lazy app without force-shutting down the mac?\n\nA: In the terminal type : \nkillall -9 Google\\ Chrome\n\nSince Google Chrome uses multiple process it will kill all the process of the app with that command. \n", "Q: Is it possible to update an iphone 3g ios 4.2.1 to ios 5?

It seemed to me that the pecs where the same, so I tried it.\nA few minutes latter I hear a click and the iphone stopped charging and a slight burn sent got in the air.

Maybe your question relates to an older version of macOS.\n", "Q: How can I prevent iTunes from automatically downloading podcasts? I listen to podcasts, but almost always on my iPhone (by downloading them on the iPhone directly) and almost never on my computer through iTunes. I do sync my iPhone with iTunes. However, any time I open iTunes, it tries to automatically download new podcast episodes. Is there a way to prevent this?\nI tried plugging in my iPhone, going to the Podcasts tab, and unchecking Sync Podcasts, but this resulted in a dialog box asking if I'm sure I do not want to sync podcasts, and informing me that if I continue, all existing podcasts on my iPhone will be deleted. That's not my desired result, of course.\n\nA: For anyone coming across this now, in the latest version of iTunes (~v12.5.1) it's much easier to prevent downloads for all podcasts you're subscribed to. \nSteps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to \"Podcasts\" in the menubar dropdown. \n\n*In the second column of your subscribed podcasts, at the bottom there's two buttons, \"Refresh\" and \"Defaults...\", click \"Defaults...\"\n\n*In the popup, set \"Download Episodes\" to \"Off\". \n\n\n\n\nA: What you observe is the default setting for podcasts in iTunes, which is to download the most recent episode of a podcast.\nTo avoid this, follow these steps:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Podcasts in the iTunes Library pop-up menu.  \n\n*Select a podcast.  \n\n*Right click and choose \"Settings\" (or alternatively, click on the gear icon next to the podcast title on the episode list on the\nright).\n\n*In the Podcast Settings dialog, under the \"Settings for:\" dropdown, select \"Podcasts Defaults\" (this would apply your\nchanges to all podcasts).  \n\n*In the \"When new episodes are available:\" dropdown, select \"Do nothing\" (the default option being \"Download the most recent one\").  \n\n*Click OK.\n\n\nWith this change, iTunes will never download new episodes for any of your podcasts.

In my experience, the Apple In Ear Headphones self-destruct after about 12 months (I've gone through about 3 pairs) and they now seem to be discontinued.\nA microphone and perfect iPhone compatibility on the remote control is required of course. A bit better bass wouldn't hurt either since the iPhone equaliser doesn't affect apps like Spotify.\nSo my question is, which in-ear headphones deliver the same or better sound quality and are at least as rugged as the Apple's headphones?\n\nA: The best set of earphones might depend upon your preferences, your goals, your budget, and other consideration, so let me focus on giving you some background and explaining how you can educate yourself and make an informed decision.\n\nIf what you care about is sound quality, I recommend taking a look at Head-Fi.org and Hydrogenaudio forums.  You can read through dozens and dozens of knowledgeable reviews of headphones there.  This buying guide from Head-Fi provides an excellent buying guide for shopping for headphones.\nIf you care about sound quality, I do not recommend relying on mainstream sources (e.g., Cnet, random web sites, tech magazines, etc.) for headphone reviews.  They have extremely poor knowledge about this topic and are often a poor judge of sound quality; I'm often disappointed with their reviews.\nThere are several different categories of headphones: earbuds, full-sized circumaural hadphones (these go around your ear, but do not rest on the ear itself), full-sized supra-aural headphones (these have pads that rest on the ear), and in-ear monitors.  The circumaural and supra-aural headphones can be \"open\" or \"closed\".  Each of these varieties has different tradeoffs.\n\n\n*\n\n*Earbuds are small headphones that fit loosely in your outer ear.  They are portable, cheap, and widely available, but give the worst sound quality.\n\n*Circumaural headphones can give excellent sound quality and are comfortable, but they're large and not so portable.\n\n*Supra-aural headphones can give very good sound quality.  Opinions vary about their comfort, and they're not so portable.\n\n*In-ear monitors go inside your ear canal and form a tight seal.  They are basically like earplugs, with a tiny speaker inserted into them.  They offer excellent sound quality (in my opinion, the very best sound quality).  They offer very good portability.  They're also very good for travel (because they block outside noise).  However, they tend to be expensive, and some people don't like having something stuck in their ear.  Also, they are not so good for walking/running, because a bone-conductance effect causes you to hear a thud every time your foot strikes the ground.\nAs far as open vs closed (which only applies to the full-sized circumaural/supra-aural variety):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open headphones don't try to provide any seal.  This means that if you use them in a room with others, other people may be able to hear some of what you are hearing.  If you're using headphones to avoid bothering others, you might not want open headphones.\n\n*Closed headphones provide a bit of a partial seal, so you won't bother others.\nPersonally, I love in-ear monitors.  I love the Etymotics ER-4P; they are an outstanding quality, a reference in this space.  Shure, Westone, Ultimate Ears, and others also make very high quality in-ear monitors.\nIf you care about sound quality, you'll be amazed by the difference in sound quality between your Apple stock earbuds and good in-ear monitors (or really, any quality headphone); the difference is enormous.  You'll pay a lot more, but in my opinion, if you can afford it, it's worth it.\nIf what you care about is that they're cheap, you might want to look at earbuds.  If you're looking for medium-priced open supra-aural headphones, Grado has pretty good value (SR-60 or SR-80).  For full-sized headphones, Sennheiser is a standard, well-respected brand.  But see the buying guide for more specific recommendations.\n\nSince you mentioned you want headphones with a microphone capability, you could look at Etymotic's headset + earphone products, such as the MC3 or HF3; both are advertised as providing support for the iPhone, microphone, and full 3-button remote control.  I'm sure there are many other excellent options from other vendors; I mention the Etymotics ones only because I'm a happy customer of their other products.\n\nI'm afraid I don't have any data on durability.  All I can tell you is that I've had my Etymotics ER-4P headphones for over a decade now (heavily used: I use them daily), with no problems.  You can find price information via the web or at your favorite store.\n\nA: I too am an Etymotics owner and fan, but for everyday phone carry I've been using various models from JLABs. I'm too much a wizened a veteran of the audio wars to go into gritty subjective details about the audio quality (or perceived lack there of.) They offer a variety of models at various price points. I've been very happy with the three or four sets I've owned and had one set replaced—no questions asked—when one of the buds started to short out. Great customer service. Good sound—though perhaps not for critical listening. Quality build and no-tangle cords. Available via Amazon and often offered on deal. \nMost recently I find myself mostly packing their single-ear bud so I can chat with friends or listen to podcasts while riding my bike and still keep an ear available for passing cyclists. (This is on the bike path. Once I hit the shared road, I reduce distractions.)\n", "Q: Can someone on my network access my Aperture app and how do I prevent it? I am on a network at an office I am visiting.  I opened my Aperture app and plugged in my camera to import some photos.  When I hit import the tab opened showing my camera and another computer on the same network.  Is someone else accessing my Aperture and how can I prevent that?\n\nA: You can see them because they have file sharing or some other service turned on. Unless you have turned on some sharing options (like file sharing, remote login, Remote Management, etc…) they can't see your computer on the network. If you have turned on some sharing options then they can see your computer, but probably can't access anything outside of your \"/Users//Public\" folder on it.\n", "Q: How can I run a command that requires user input through oh-my-zsh alias? I'm trying to add Reminder.app items through the command line by invoking an alias. I use the Automator workflow solution from this question: How can I add reminders via the command line?, which invokes a basic workflow containing an empty Reminders item, via the following command line input:\nautomator -i remindertext add_reminder.workflow\n\nThis works perfectly, but is clumsy to type, so I want to set an alias for it. My question is: how do I set an alias in .zshrc that allows for me to set the reminder item text when I invoke the alias? It would basically need to be able to replace 'remindertext' with a variable, like so:\nalias reminder='automator -i <variable> add_reminder.workflow'\n\nIs this possible in zsh/oh-my-zsh?\n\nA: Aliases are used as a shortcuts - sipmple commands that expand to longer ones.\nIf you need to pass an argument to it, you would need to create a function.\nMaybe try something like:\nreminder () { automator -i $1 add_reminder.workflow' }\n\nHere $1 will expand to the first argument that you've passed to the function.\nSo you'll to do something like:\nreminder \"Buy potatoes\"\n\nP.S: I haven't tried it, since I don't have zsh with me right now, so if it breaks, give me a shout.\n", "Q: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline' with HTML + shell script I've been learning the shell with a great tutorial, linuxcommand.org. After a lot of learning and practice with navigating directories, editing files, etc, I've moved on to writing shell scripts.\nOne of the first tutorials linuxcommand.org has is using HTML in a shell script to return some system info. You can check it out here . I'm currently on the 'Command Substitution and Constants' section. \nOne of the first things in the tutorial said the file could be used by redirecting the standard output to .html:\n\n\n~me$ ./sysinfo_page > sysinfo_page.html\n\n\nmy script looks exactly like the one on the link, but I'll post it anyway:\n(the only difference is linux uses the env var $HOSTNAME, I'm on OS X and it's $LOGNAME)\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# sysinfo_page - Generate an HTML page based on system information\n\ntitle=\"My System Information\"\nRIGHT_NOW=$(date +\"%x %r %Z\")\nTIME_STAMP=\"Updated on $RIGHT_NOW by $USER\"\n\ncat <<- _EOF_\n    <html>\n    <head>\n        <title>\n        $title $LOGNAME\n        </title>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1>$title $LOGNAME</h1>\n        <p>$TIME_STAMP</p>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n_EOF_\n\nWhen I type into the command line:\n\n\n~me$  ./sysinfo_page\n\n\nit gives me the contents of only the HTML, but it isn't formatted and still displays the tags. I'm assuming that by redirecting the standard output to a .html extension would give me the formatted HTML page, without the tags but I wouldn't know because, after giving chmod rwx permission with 755, I type:\n\n\n~$me  ./sysinfo_page.html\n\n\nAnd get this error: \n./sysinfo_page.html: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'\n./sysinfo_page.html: line 1: `<html>'\n\nI understand by what I've read that < > indicates a placeholder, but that's the HTML syntax...and exactly how it works on the tutorial. I thought maybe adding a <!DOCTYPE> would fix it, but didn't. My question is, what am I doing wrong here? How can I get it to display the HTML page correctly?\n\nA: HTML is not a script, it's a markup language. You need a browser to render HTML. To view it, you probably want\nopen sysinfo_page.html\n\n\nA: Wrapping your HTML markup in single quotes should allow you to run it directly in the terminal without error though it just shows you the markup and that defeats the purpose of using HTML. \nUsing open as stated by glenn is probably what you want.\n", "Q: how can I write on my screen using terminal? How can I write on my computer screen or open an application like notes and write on it from Terminal??\nI can open up notes or any other app/document.\n\nA: Terminal is a CLI, or Command Line Interface, and notes and other text editor apps that you are familiar with are part of the GUI family, Graphical User Interface. The GUI is most likely the type of interface you interact with every day. \nThat being said, you cannot open and run a GUI app in a CLI. If you open up myapp.app from Terminal, it will open it up as a GUI. For example, you can't open up Safari in terminal, do a google search from the command line, and then watch a video. However, there are a few CLI text editors that would be similar to notes already installed on your computer. My favorite is vi.\nOpen your terminal, and type vi after the prompt. A new interface should appear with a description of vi. I'll post a link to all the commands in vi at the end of my post, but I'll go over a few of the essential ideas. \n\n\n*\n\n*No mouse. It's 100% a CLI, meaning you can't use the mouse for anything. Instead, use the arrow keys.\n\n*With that in mind, when you enter vi you are in command mode. We'll talk more about that in a second. To add text, you have to enter insert  mode, which is done by typing i+return. Now you are in insert mode and you can type whatever you want.\n\n*Command mode: When you are done typing, you're going to want to save your file most likely. To do this, you must enter command mode. Press the escape key. Then type:\n:wq filename+return. This saves a new file called filename. Keep in mind it saves to the current directory you are in. To fully exit and save, type :wq\nYou can even change the standard output to make it viewable in the GUI:\n\n\nfilename > filename.txt\n\n\nThen, you can open filename.txt in textedit, or any other GUI text editor. \nOne last cool feature of vi, is it lets you edit current ASCII files anywhere on your computer. Just type vi filename in the prompt.\nHere is a link to a basic list of vi commands\n\nA: An extremely easy way to edit text in the command line that doesn't require a significant investment of time to learn is nano. \nnano foo opens foo if it exists in the directory or a blank file if it doesn't.\nYou navigate the cursor using your arrow keys, and use control+o to save(enter to confirm filename) \nand control+x to close. \nThe best news is that you don't have to memorize these commands because they are all displayed at the bottom of the terminal window while you are using nano.\n", "Q: How to know if a SSD will work on OS X? I have a 2010 Macbook pro with a hard drive, and I'd like to replace it with a SSD.\nInformation I've read about OS X and SSD is generally quite old, and not reassuring (not all SSD are supported, and the thing about the TRIM command not enabled for non-apple SSD…).\nSo: is there any problem anymore with OS X and (non-apple) SSD?\nThis question is intended to be generic, but to give an example here is the SSD I'm considering to buy: Samsung 840 EVO 750Go.\n\nA: I replaced my stock HDD with a similar Samsung SSD in my 2010 MBP without any issues. It's a huge improvement over HDD as well. You will need to enable TRIM though. I used this trim utility on Mountain Lion. (Caveat: it WILL work without TRIM, but I wouldn't advise it. A good discussion on the topic is on SU here.)\n", "Q: How can I add contacts from one iPhone/iPad to another iPhone that has a different iTunes account? I've had two iPhones for the last year.  One is for work, and the other is my personal phone.  I set up each phone with its own iTunes account, and now I'm wanting to consolidate to one phone.  So is there an easy way to add (not replace) contacts that I have on my personal iPhone (it's also on my iPad via iCloud) and add them to the existing contacts I have on my work iPhone?\n\nA: Exporting your contacts from an iPhone is very easy: all data about the contact, from name, phone number, picture, email, URL, etc, can be exported as an inclusive vCard bundle from iCloud (or without for example with this app) and sent to someone else by email or text message. (While we’ll focus on sending contacts between iPhones, these vCards are also usable by other iOS devices, Macs, Windows, Windows Phone, Android, and even Blackberry phones, because the exported VCF format is pretty much universally accepted across all platforms as an address book standard.)\nYou’ll probably want to backup and sync the new iPhone beforehand just in case something goes haywire importing the vCard, however unlikely that is.\n\n\n*\n\n*log into te iCloud accound from your old iPhone and select all your contacts on the settings button (bottom left). It says Export vCard. Click this and you can Export all your contact information as a vCard .vcf file\n\n*create an email with the vCard attachment and send it to yourself (or rather, the email on the other iPhone)\n\n*On the other phone you can import the vCard: Open the email containing the contacts on the iPhone and tap on the vCard.vcf file attachment\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on “Add All # Contacts” to import the address book to the iPhone\n\n\n\nNotice the add option tells you how many contacts are stored within the vCard, making it easy to determine if all intended contact information is included. You can also manually select individual contacts from the list if you only wish to import one or two, but for the purpose here we’ll transfer them all over.\n", "Q: What are the default QuickLook plugins in /System/Library/QuickLook/ under OS X 10.8?

You'll need to download the drivers from Sharp Website for MX-2600N Mac Drivers.\nOnce you have downloaded that DMG, you'll need to open it, deploy, and install the PKG file inside correlating to the Mac OS version you are running on the destination system.  So for a client machine with Mountain Lion (10.8) you'll need to deploy that package to the machine either via SSH, email, Apple Remote Desktop, or some other method.  You mentioned through SSH so if you have a session open you would SCP it from your machine to that machine.  \nTo install, you would run this command sudo installer -pkg /path/to/package.pkg -target /\nOnce the drivers are installed, you can then add the printer to the machine and have the user select the Secure Print feature in the Printing Preferences.\n", "Q: How to get a document to display its contents in quick look Is there a way to associate a file type (*.md from Github) in a such a way that its contents are 'visible' with OS X's quick look?\nI've associated the extension (*.md) with TextMate, but this doesn't have the desired effect.\nOther text files (e.g. *.rb) work with quick look as expected.\n\nA: You can install QLMarkdown plugin for Finder:\nhttps://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown#installation\n\nQLMarkdown is a simple QuickLook generator for Markdown files.

Will the following work?  If not, can someone propose better alternaives to solve this problem?\nSummary problem:  I want to sync multiple MacBook Air's, Pro's and possibly Mini's with the same user-account info, for only one account--call it myuser.  All systems will have the same MacOS major rev.  eg: they're all 10.7 or 10.8 or higher.  I do NOT want to employ OS X Server for the synchronizing.\nSummary, proposed solution:  git-sync the Preferences and /User/myuser directory, rsync the Application directories, and use known-working mechanisms (Dropbox, IMAP) to sync everything else.\nDetails.\nMigration Assistant is unreliable for complete copy/sync per this and this and my personal experience.  ChronoSync, per this discussion looks interesting, but I don't know exactly what it's doing for Preferences... and I want to exactly what's going on.  I've also restored TimeMachine backups and found they do not replicate the environment I backed up (huge disappointment).  I'm an experienced system admin on non-MacOS sytems, so consider me a control freak.\nI've used git to sync Terminal.app/shell settings in /User/myuser and Thunderbird profile(s) across multiple Macs (git branching for diff Thunderbird profiles on different Macs if/as need be provides useful flexibility).  Despite the lack of depth of git's file-metada management, this has worked well.  I'd like to git-sync (to a \"central-repository\" server/service like Bitbucket) the following directories across my Macs, employing branches as needed/wanted for unique customizations:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Preferences\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes\n\n*~/Library/Preferences\n\n*~/Library/PreferencePanes\n(Everything else in ~/Library and /Library appears to be uninmportant or automatically regenerated.)\nThen I plan to rsync the following together (git is less useful here due to ease of recreating installed applications plus less practical due to size of /Applications):\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications\n\n*~/Applications\nI realize I may need to close all pertinent applications+processes in order to properly sync the Preferences and Applications spaces and avoid running-process locks and related problems.\nI'm not as familiar with any Preference-management-magic that might be in auto-deployment systems like Absolute Manage, Casper, Munki, Sikuli, Salt and similar tools.  Would love to know if there's Preference-management capability/knowledge/know-how in these tools, and if so, how to reuse said knowledge.  Each of the said tools seem to address a broader scope of requirements and present a higher barrier to entry/employment.  I'd rather just start with my very easy to setup git-based method on ~/Library/Preferences (and the like) going.\nAll of the other directories on these systems--particularly in /User/myuser--are being synchronized via other means, like Dropbox, IMAP email, and similar, already-proven methods like rsync.  I'm less certain rsync will work for copying /Applications, hence the specific call-out above.\n\nA: Seems like ChronoSync could help in a limited way. The support pages have warnings on syncing ~/Library.

But in case that the battery is not charge after the iPhone has been packed in 2011-2012, what will be the condition of those batteries? After all this time for several years on the stock.\n\nA: It depends on how the batteries are maintained since Lithium-ion polymer batteries need to be used and recharged regularly. There will definitely be some reduction in capacity as time passes, regardless of whether the batteries are regularly used/charged or not.\nFrom Battery University - Is Lithium-ion the Ideal Battery? (emphasis mine):\n\nAging is a concern with most lithium-ion batteries and many manufacturers remain silent about this issue. Some capacity deterioration is noticeable after one year, whether the battery is in use or not. The battery frequently fails after two or three years. It should be noted that other chemistries also have age-related degenerative effects. This is especially true for nickel-metal-hydride if exposed to high ambient temperatures. At the same time, lithium-ion packs are known to have served for five years in some applications.\nManufacturers are constantly improving lithium-ion. New and enhanced chemical combinations are introduced every six months or so.

It happens quite often that I 'mentally' switch to other monitor, but the active application is still on different one, where I don't look. Then I start typing, or press some shortcut which leads to unwanted behaviour (e.g. I close an editor tab instead of tab in the chrome).\nI was wondering is there is any app, which would use camera to guess where the user is looking and switch the active app accordingly. I am sure that it would not be perfect, but I would give it a try.\nAny other suggestions to deal with my problem are also welcome.\n\nA: My answer falls in the \"other suggestions\" opening provided.\nThere's a tool called Isolator that may help you stop mistaking which app is in the foreground (and keep your focus in the right place).

I want to achieve something like this. What would be the best way to remove the print from the keys, or can I find a shop that sells those keys with out a characters on them?\n\nA: You can't erase the print, because the \"foreground\" and \"background\" are two colors of plastic that comprise the entire keycap.  That's so the print doesn't wear off.\nYou could cover the print with paint or a sharpie, but that would wear off.\nStickers feel bad, and do wear off (I had this problem in an Avid video suite).\nSome blank-keycap keyboards are for sale, e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard, but they're not exactly what you want.\nSome vendors sell replacement keycaps, like http://www.ebay.com/itm/281064247677 , but they may not have blanks, because they get theirs from other Apple keyboards instead of making them themselves.\nThe best, but not quick-and-dirty, solution would be to take RTV molds of the original keycaps (pry them off like this: http://store.apple.com/us/question/answers/product/MC184D/B/1/QK2AFXHXKKA2J7AXA ), and then mold your own keycaps from scratch.\n", "Q: Removing only birth years from a group in my Address Book A lot of my contacts (600+) had somehow got their birth years set to 2000.

So I ended up repurchasing all my ringtones!\n\n\n*\n\n*I've noticed that under 'Settings->iTunes & App Stores' the Apple ID is my own, however, when I try to update any apps, it's my husband's Apple ID.\n\n*I've confirmed that it is syncing under my own iTunes account.\n\n\nI don't know how I'm logged on to 2 different users and why my apps are linked to his Apple ID. I've tried logging out and back in and syncing the phone again (making sure it's my account).\n\nA: If an application was originally downloaded using your husband's account it will be associated with his account.\nAn easy way to tell what apps are linked to his Apple ID is to go to your Apps Library in iTunes on your computer. Select an app and press command+i on your keyboard (control+i on Windows). This will get info about the app. Make sure you are on the Summary tab and there will be a field that shows the associated Apple ID.\nThis kind of situation can be avoided by each of you having a different user account and different iTunes Library on the computer you sync with. \nTo get your phone to stop asking for his password when you update apps, you will need to delete any apps that are associated with his ID and redownload them using your iTunes account.\n", "Q: Time Capsule and Network shares not showing in Finder through VPN I'm on my neighbours WiFi, and connecting to my network to my Windows 7 PC which is set up as a VPN server using the native feature.

Also when I'm actually connected to my home network my Raspberry Pi appears in the sidebar, but when I connect over VPN it doesn't.\nIs there a way to get the network shares to appear automatically in Finder over a VPN connection?\n\nA: Usually the sidebar shows Network Devices which are announcing themselves and are recognized by the 'Bonjour'-Service. For that to happen the appropiate Ports have to be used, in case of the 'Bonjour'-Service that would be Ports 1900, 5350, 5432 and 5353 (see \"Well known TCP and UDP ports used by Apple software products\")\nMy first suggestion would be to check your VPN-Server if these ports are blocked, which would prohibit the Devices showing up in the sidebar.\nIf the Raspberry is an SMB-Share you can try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences » Network\n\n*Click the network interface you use for the shares (that probably should be your WiFi Connection rather than the VPN-Connection. You have to try both eventually)\n\n*Click on the Advanced button at lower right\n\n*Click on WINS tab, and manually enter the workgroup name of the\nserver\n\n*Click the '+' under the WINS Servers list\n\n*Enter the IP of the server \n\n*Click OK, Apply, etc. \n\n", "Q: Monitoring a file in real time I need a text file monitored in a way that the contents stay updated in a window on my screen - the contents of the text file will keep changing periodically and I want the display to update the changes ASAP.\nAre there any programs out there (like tail for win32) that can help me achieve this?

I never (intentionally) hide an app with ⌘H, which could be rebound for each app (e.g. Finder), but this is obviously the wrong approach. So, (how) can you disable ⌘H for application-hiding in one fell swoop?\n\n\nA: In addition to the accepted answer, this can be accomplished easily with BetterTouchTool.\nOpen BTT Preferences. If it isn't selected already, select Gestures.\nUnder Select Application, select Global.\nAdd a New Shortcut: ⌘H and leave the Trigger set to No Action.\n\nClose the Preferences window, and ⌘H should now be disabled for all applications.\nThe downside compared to the accepted answer is that this fix involves running an application. However since many Mac users are already running BTT in the background for other purposes, this fix can be done in a few seconds and might be simpler for some users.\n\nA: If you do not want an approach for separate applications, but for TOTAL disabling of the shortcut, you can use Karabiner (FREE, and OPEN SOURCE :) ) and after installing it add a special complex modification rule\nThe link already contains the search query, so just look for Prevent unintended command-h hide window and then click on Import and you are done!\n\nA: You might use a private.xml like this with Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::H, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\nA: SKHD is a simple and neat hotkey daemon for macOS. It allows you to define application-specific bindings as well. You can configure a binding for your app to ignore a hotkey or even configure to send a new one instead.\nFor example, ⌘h hides Alacritty.app by default. You would synthesize an empty keypress as below in order to ignore that keypress.\nAdd following configuration to your .skhdrc.

It creates internet-ready QuickTime movies. \nAnother great use is recording phone calls that come through the Mac via Yosemite's new Handoff feature. \n(full disclosure: I work on this product!)\n\nA: Facetime does not include this functionality directly. \nOne of the possibilities you have is using QuickTime X's screen recording feature. \n", "Q: Seemingly random kernel panics for the last 3 months Sat Sep 14 09:38:58 2013\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0x876eee8b): \"Uncorrectable Fbd memory error detected.

I just got my new MacBook Air delivered yesterday.  I opened it up today and was happy until it couldn't connect to Wi-Fi.  After Googling I found out that this has been an issue and that Apple created a patch for it.  But that was in July and I got mine yesterday.  \nDo I have to download that patch even though it's old? I got mine 24 hours ago so I would assume that it would've come with that patch already on it? \nI am running 10.8.4.  My ISP is Verizon Fios.\nI am confused.  Not sure what to do.  Please advise.  \n\nA: Something is wrong here!\nIt is correct there are always software updates, but it is not possible that your Airport (WiFi) does not work at all (unless it is broken) and no software will fix that, so you need to send your computer back.\nMake sure it is turned on in your system preference - Network- WiFi ON!\nNow to the software updates:\nEven if you bought it tomorrow does not means it has the latest software updates.\nSince you do not have a WiFi Internet connection you can not get the software updates via Internet.\nYou could bring it back to Apple and they will fix it.\nAlternatively, get a piece of Ethernet cable and connect to the router.\nSince it is a MBA that does not has a Ethernet plug, you will need a Thunderbolt to Ethernet plug.\nThen Click on the Apple (top left) and on the software update.\n", "Q: Use internal speakers while headphones are plugged in to iPod touch 5th generation An audio plug that was used to connect to speakers is stuck in the audio jack of my iPod touch 5th generation and I can't get it out.\nIs there a way to change the settings so I can only use the internal speakers, or is there an app that would let me switch to using internal speakers even though headphones are plugged in?\n\nA: No. Only if you remove the object and the switch that detects the object resets to the normal position will the internal speaker option come back.\nSee these threads for more details.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why are my Macbook's internal speakers not available?\n\n*Use internal speakers with others plugged in\n", "Q: Pre-installed movies and photos on new MBA MBA 13\" \nI when I got it home for the first time.

Not your 450MB but we are getting close. You can assume the files you see are system files (yes your system uses images and video !) \nI would definitely not suggest to delete theses files since they are used by the system. \n\nA: (Not able to comment, since I don't have enough rep)\nMy understanding is that they are tutorial pictures and videos from pre-installed apps such as keynote, iPhoto or Garageband. \nYou could use a image file reducer such as JPEGmini to reduce the file size of those images, but there's probably no need.\n", "Q: How to quit Trim Enabler? I just updated Trim Enabler after updating my Mac to OS X 10.8.5. The new version doesn't have a quit button, option or anything like that. How do I close it? I cannot remove it from the menu bar by dragging it. What can I do, short of rebooting?\n\n\nA: You can use AppleScript to send the application a quit Apple event:\nosascript -e 'quit app \"Trim Enabler\"'\n\nQuit Apple events are also used by loginwindow to quit non-Cocoa applications when you log out.\nIf that doesn't work, killall Trim\\ Enabler is probably also safe.

Is it possible to do without using drawing tools?\nI need a line being possible to add above any character, not just ones that have lines in certain languages.\n\nA: You can use Unicode combining character U+0305 COMBINING OVERLINE. It can be found by searching in the palette from Edit → Emoji & Symbols (formerly Edit → Special Characters…), or by using a specialized keyboard layout such as the built-in Unicode Hex Input or my own custom one mostly designed for mathematics.\nHere's some sample text with overlines, but note that the quality of the results may vary widely with the font, application, and operating system in use by the viewer.\n\nA̅ B̅ C̅ D̅ a̅ b̅ c̅ d̅ α̅ β̅ γ̅ δ̅ ε̅\n\nAlso, since the position of the overline depends on the height of the character, it will not necessarily align over multiple adjacent characters.\nWhen using Unicode combining characters directly, you must type or paste them after the base character (and once you do so, they will be treated as one unit for editing purposes). This is the opposite of classic “dead key” combinations like Option-e a á where you specify the accent first.\n\nA: A quick and dirty solution in Pages 5, is to select the text you want a line over and add \"____\" as \"Phonetic Guide Text\" from the Format menu. The line might be slightly thinner than you want, but it's fast and requires no extra tools\n\nA: If you are doing more than just individual characters separated by text, I'd suggest you use an equation editor.  Pages can import MathType or you can use something online, like \nhttp://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php\nto produce images you can insert.

It works great. It even leaves it super shiny and smooth. I do it every now and again. I do the same to my iPhone and MagicMouse. I'm a bit of a neat freak in that way, but I figure I spent a lot on these so I want to keep them in good shape.\n", "Q: SSD and Mountain Lion I have a Vertex Plus r2 OCZ SSD drive in my Macbook Pro 2010,\nIt's been going well and it only cost me like 80gbp.\nI noticed recently (not that I run tests regularly) that the performance has dropped by nearly 50%\n200Mbps read -> 90,      160 write -> 80\nThere is so much misinfo on SSD's out there it drives me mental, I don't have the 'trim enabler' hack installed because I read that the SSD drive had it's own built in hardware regeneration/ware leveling/trim type thing going on.\nMy question: how can I get performance back to what it was like when I bought it (6 months ago).\nI was thinking:\nA) Enable trim?\nB) do a complete format and reinstall?\nC) Leave the computer on and idle and hope it does it's hardware trim thing or whatever?\nAny thoughts?\nThanks,\nJohn\n\nA: Try erasing free space (from Disk Utility, on the bottom left corner of the \"erase\" tab of your drive), and then enable trim (via Trim Enabler).\nMore than likely this drop in performance is caused by the SSD having to clear memory before being able to write to it. Flash memory can only bring bits up (from 0 to 1), meaning that over-writing a non-zero byte requires first erasing the whole byte, then bringing up whatever bits are needed. This means that 2 operations are needed (erase, write) rather than just 1 (write). TRIM helps improve performance by actively zeroing out memory locations that have been deleted during idle times, allowing for a single write operation to be sufficient for writing to that location. Erasing free space will do the same thing, but it's a one time deal, whereas TRIM works in the background to keep it all tidy.\n", "Q: What is the optimal AirPlay configuration when using two Airports Express? I have two Airport Express base stations in my abode:\n\n\n*\n\n*an AirPort Express 802.11n (2nd Generation) – A1392, and\n\n*an AirPort Express 802.11n (1st Generation) – A1264\nCall the former (the newer model) A and the latter B. They are in the following configuration: A is wired to the cable modem and is the primary wireless base station; B is in a different room, configured to join that wireless network, and is connected to a stereo system. The goal of this setup is to provide the fastest possible internet to laptops, iPhones, etc. while enabling AirPlay music streaming to the stereo.\nUnfortunately, I can't run a long ethernet cable between rooms (in a practical manner) – though if I could, of course I'd be able to remove one of the base stations from the setup entirely. Naturally, I would also like to keep the two base stations as part of the same wireless network, so I can use the internet while also playing music over AirPlay.\nThis Apple Knowledge Base document suggests that B joining A's network (the current configuration) is better than B extending A's network, for \"overhead\" reasons:\n\nConnecting to an existing Wi-Fi network as part of a legacy WDS or Extended Network\nAirPort Express extends Wi-Fi network range and streams iTunes music simultaneously using Extended Network for AirPort Express with 802.11n, or legacy WDS with AirPort Express 802.11g from another Wi-Fi base station.\nDue to the overhead required for this configuration, you may expect AirPlay drop-outs such as intermittent loss of audio.\n\nI'm not sure if that's really an issue since they're both 802.11n routers. Then again, B is a \"Draft 802.11n\" device. I'm not sure how that affects things.\nProblem\nStreaming music from a laptop, regardless of the source (iTunes, Pandora, etc.) tends to stutter, intermittently cutting out for a few seconds. This seems to be a common issue. I haven't tested whether higher-bitrate songs causes the audio to cut out more frequently.\nQuestion\nHow should I configure my wireless network(s) to reduce, and ideally prevent entirely, the audio from cutting out when I play music to my stereo using AirPlay? All of the hardware involved is Apple-made, so I can only imagine this is not a terribly exotic setup.\nI haven't tried swapping the base stations yet. I'm willing to do that, but I'd really prefer to avoid trial-and-error with every combination of physical and software configurations. What can I say – it's not exactly my idea of a fun weekend project.\nI have tried setting up a 5GHz wireless network on A, and having B join that, but it doesn't appear that B can. It looks like A1264 can broadcast at 5GHz, though I don't know if that implies it should be able to join a 5GHz network. Either way, it sure doesn't seem to be able to join my 5GHz network.\nPotentially relevant details\n\n\n*\n\n*There is a printer connected to B with USB.\n\n*No computers in the room have Bluetooth enabled, though there is an iPhone 5 and Pebble watch that are paired with Bluetooth. I mention this because BT supposedly can cause problems with AirPlay.\n\n\nA: Funny story.\nSwitching B from \"Join a wireless network\" to \"Extend a wireless network\" seemed to fix the problem instantly, despite the caveat in that Apple KB doc.\n\n\nTwo days later, the problem has returned. It seems that I can deliberately exacerbate the problem by using extra bandwidth, such as by running a speed test (over WiFi, of course).\n", "Q: Safari not warning on SSL certificate hostname mismatch For some reason (e.g., bad preferences setting, maybe?) Safari 6.0.5, on OS X 10.8.4, is failing to give me an SSL Certificate Warning when I visit a site whose hostname doesn't match the hostname bound to the site's certificate.\nReproduced below is the certificate information that Safari gave me, but only when I clicked on the \"https\" icon located between the favicon and the hostname (with domain name redacted). It plainly indicates that the certificate isn't valid for the hostname.\n\nI believe that this information about the hostname mismatch should have appeared in a warning notifier containing the message:\n\nSafari can't verify the identity of the website \"sbxstg.redacted.com\"\n\nBut I wasn't given any such notifier; just an address bar whose contents make it appear that everything went well and without error, and that I have a secure connection to the proper holder of the certificate. (!!)\nCan someone please tell me where I should be looking to turn the warning feature back on, if I've somehow inadvertantly turned it off?\nOn the other hand, is it possible that I've found a corner-case/bug in Safari? Note that the domain to which Safari claims the certificate is bound is simply redacted.com, and not *.redacted.com. Could that possibly be confusing the algorithm that Safari uses to decide whether to pop up the warning?\nFor what it's worth, Firefox 21.0 running on the same Mac does give me the expected \"This Connection is Untrusted\" message, stating in the Technical Details section that:\n\nsbxstg.redacted.com uses an invalid security certificate.\nThe certificate is only valid for the following names:\nredacted.com , www.redacted.com.\"\n\nUpdate: I've been able to reproduce this behavior on Safari 6.2.3, but only after getting an initial notifier warning me that there was a problem with the certificate (\"Safari can't verify the identity of the website sbxstg.redacted.com. The certificate for this website is invalid...\").\nOnce I'd clicked \"Continue\", though, subsequent attempts to load https://sbxstg.redacted.com appeared to work as described in my original post (i.e., no obvious, modal warning -- just the one that is hidden until displaying the certificate information).\nSo it looks like you get one chance. And if you decide \"damn the torpedoes,\" then it's on you forever after to remember that there's something hinky about the site/cert, because you have effectively \"turned off\" the in-your-face warning for that particular site. (I theorize that when I originally posted this question, I must have already hit \"Continue\" at some earlier point, and didn't remember that I'd done so.)\nSo the question remains: How do I turn the warning feature back on?\n\nA: So, as noted in the update, Safari does actually warn you -- once. \nIf you decide to proceed anyway, then for the remainder of that browser session, you need to remember that you're talking to a potentially compromised server, because you will see no evidence of that except by examining the certificate (by clicking on the https/padlock icon). \nHowever, exiting Safari and restarting it restores the warning. A visit to the compromised site in the new instance of the browser once again presents the warning. \n\nA: The Server could be having Subject Alternative Name.\nYou can verify the same by running the following command in Terminal.app\n$ echo \"\" |  openssl s_client -connect www.youtube.com:443 | openssl x509 -text  |grep -i -A 5  'X509v3 Subject Alternative Name'\n", "Q: Is it possible to display my Mac on my iPhone using a USB cable?

I don't really need these applications and I want to save my disk space, so I was thinking about removing them.\nHowever, if I do remove them, is it possible to restore them if I want them later?\n\nA: You should be able to download them with your Apple ID (the one used when you bought or registered your new Mac) from the Mac App Store.\nYou can try to log in, and then see if you have access to them (you should also have access to the OS X, so you can re-install it too), otherwise you should contact Apple, so you get access to the free apps - and OS X Mountain Lion.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\n\nRestoring iLife applications after Internet Restore of OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion\nIf you erase install OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion on a new Mac that shipped with OS X Lion or OS X Mountain Lion installed, you can download iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand from the Mac App Store.\n\n*\n\n*After installation, start (up) from OS X.\n\n*Double-click the App Store icon in the dock.\n\n*Enter your Apple ID and password.\n\n*Click Purchases.\n\n*If you haven't previously accepted your bundled iLife applications within the Mac App Store, you should see your iLife applications appear in the Accept portion of the screen.

Is it normal or has something gone wrong? If it is normal, are there any workarounds?\n\nA: With FileVault enabled, the disk is encrypted and cannot be accessed at all without you entering the system login password. If it weren't so (e.g., to make unattended boot work), then the point of FileVault, which is preventing access to anything without your explicit authorization, would be lost.\nSo yes, it is normal. You could create two disk partitions, encrypt the non-boot partition, and put your data there. Or, you could create encrypted disk images and use those for data you want encrypted. The problem with these approaches is that it's very hard to keep potentially sensitive data from leaking into the non-encrypted part: caches, swap files, backups, etc. If you simply encrypt everything, then this management headache goes away.\nIt's a classic tradeoff between security and convenience.\n", "Q: MacBook Air 2013 screen issues after sleep I'm having some issues with my MacBook Air (2013). Whenever the system enters hibernation, as it does after a couple of hours of sleep, the screen gets distorted when it comes back from sleep.\nWhen resuming from sleep the screen gets distorted like this:\n\n\n\nA reboot fixes that but the menu bar icons as well as some toolbar icons disappear, like in the following screen shots:\nMenu bar:\n\nFinder:\n\nMail:\n\nThese issues go away with a reboot into safe mode and then reboot (a tip which I found in a different thread here), however it all comes back after the next hibernation.\nIt seems to be power related, as it only happens if the power cord is plugged in when the computer first goes into deep sleep and then gets plugged out while in sleep. I've tested this thoroughly using the DeepSleep widget and found how to reproduce it.\nI've tried resetting the PRAM but no luck there. Also, the return from pmset -g | grep hibernatemode is 0 - is that normal on the Air? It used to be 7 on my previous MacBook.\nAnother thing that might be worth noting is that this started happening after I ran out of battery while the computer was on, however it happens every time it sleeps without power cord since then, even though it doesn't run out of power.\nUpdate:\nI thought that changing the hibernatemode to 7 worked, since my test to reproduce the issue didn't cause it anymore. However after having had the computer sleep over night it wouldn't wake up, it just showed a blank screen. This is the console output I got: http://pastebin.com/EB4SAtfe\nThe logs at 01:52 is when I put the computer to sleep and went to bed. It then wakes up 3 hours later and is then supposed to sleep again I guess. Not quite sure why it does this, it also says:\n2013-09-16 04:52:53,008 com.apple.time[13]: Next maintenance wake [Backup Interval]: <date: 0x7fb250608870> Mon Sep 16 02:03:30 2013 CEST (approx)\n\nAlthough that time has already past (It's 04:52 CEST when it schedules that). Also, there is no console output from when I wake the computer, even though I waited a good couple of minutes at the black screen before forcing a reboot as well as closed and reopened the lid.\n\nA: So here's what happened:\nI took the computer to the AppleStore, seeing it was only about three weeks old, and got them to take a look at it. Since it's a company computer I had some company benefits granting me a temporary replacement while they were fixing mine. I took my TimeMachine copy and restored it on to the borrowed Mac. I was surprised to find that the issue still appeared, which was quite annoying. So I restored the Mac again, messed around with the pmsetsettings and tried to reproduce the issue but it was impossible.\nI then remembered that the issue started appearing a few days ago when I did a battery calibration (Drained the Mac completely) so I restored to a TimeMachine backup from before that and Boom, the issue was gone. At about the same time they called from the store and said that they couldn't reproduce the issue, so I told them what I had found, came in and got my computer back.\nAll in all, a really weird story but apparently something related to draining the battery while the computer was still on got corrupted and was then included in the TimeMachine backup.\n\nA: Are there any relevant messages shown by pmset -g log or in system.log?\nI think that pmset -g hibernatemode should be 3 by default on laptops both on battery and AC power. man pmset says that \"standby only works if hibernation is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25\".\nWhat does pmset -g standby return on battery power or AC power? Did you start using the Deep Sleep widget before or after those issues started? \nSince starting up in safe mode fixed the issues, have you checked if Disk Utility shows some errors when you verify the OS X volume, or have you tried deleting /var/db/dyld/?\nI had a similar issue on my MacBook Air where toolbar icons and other icons occasionally disappeared, but it stopped happening after I reinstalled OS X from the recovery partition. The screen was never distorted after waking up from sleep though. In any case, you could try reinstalling OS X: it only takes about an hour if you have a fast Internet connection, it keeps user files and settings in place, and it might also fix other issues. Upgrading to 10.9 might have the same effect though.\n", "Q: How the low battery message graphic is loaded? When your iPhone battery is \"almost\" dead, it turn off, and then if you want to turn it on again it loads this very informative graphic: \n\nThe problem is that when you turn on \"power button\" this picture show up almost immediately, without starting up operating system or anything.\nI just wonder how they done it ? Is this behaviour is hardcoded in hardware ? Is it configurable and could be changed (to flatter design) when iOS 7 will come ? \nMy understanding is that, they have to make it in hardware, make special circuit that when battery sensor inform about very low battery status, show this picture.\nPS: I saw similar behaviour in Nexus 7 (2013)\n\nA: I believe it's just an early stage of the bootloader that checks to see if the battery has enough charge before going on to boot iOS. It's no different from being able to display the Apple logo while iOS is booting.\nIf you download one of the IPSW files (iOS images), you can unzip it and find several images inside - applelogo, batterylow, glyphplugin, and so on. A full listing can be found on this page: IPSW File Format, and I also came across this page which has instructions for replacing the low battery image with something else (essentially just replacing the file inside the IPSW with another one in the correct format).\nThat would seem to indicate that iOS 7 will (or does) have a new version of the image for all devices, just like it has a flatter Apple logo at boot time.\n", "Q: Time capsule with Samsung Galaxy Note 8 I just bought a Galaxy note 8 and I am trying to access my files on my apple time capsule.

Is there a feature that needs to be enabled on the time capsule or my note for this connection to work?\n\nA: The only feature that needs to be enabled on the Time Capsule is the file sharing feature. \n\nThis will activate AFP and SMB Filesharing which allows your Mac, PC and Android Device to access the Time Capsule and use it as a NAS (basically the Time Capsule is a glorified NAS).\nTo access your file on the Time Capsule you need a SMB client for Android such as ES File Explorer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Access the menu and select the LAN tab.\n\n*Perform a network scan and after a few seconds the time capsule should appear:\n\n\n\n*Select the computer and enter the login credentials to access your Time Capsule (username and password for the Time Capsule).

I have a SSD drive on my MacBook Pro and I'm constantly running on out of disk space because I need to install and run multiple virtual machines (Linux, Windows etc) on my Mac. Is there a way to mount a writable disk image that is also compressed? I'm hoping to use the disk image to store the VMs on. I don't mind taking the speed hit.\n\nA: I ended up going with MacZFS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a sparse-image disk via Disk Utility for about 100GB.  \n\n*Formatted it as a ZFS file system by following the instructions in the MacZFS - Getting Started section.  \n\n*Turned compression 'on' in ZFS via zfs compression=on [mypoolname]\nI tried booting a Windows XP VM off the ZFS file system and it worked. ZFS reports that it achieved a compression ratio of about 1.32x (which means my 10GB VM takes up about 6.6GB on disk). Not sure how well VMWare will play with ZFS's compression under high load, but it seems to working well so far.\n\nA: This doesn't answer the question that you asked, but it might address the problem that you have.\nVMware Fusion 6 Professional allows for linked clones, which are copies of a VM that don't duplicate the entire contents of the VM.  If you've got lots of VMs which are based on the same OS, you can save yourself considerable disk space with them. \nTo create a linked clone from the current state of a VM, select your VM in the VM library, then click \"Virtual Machine\" and select \"Create Linked Clone\".  You can do the same from a snapshot of a VM if you prefer.\nThe biggest thing to watch out for when cloning a VM is to ensure that you don't have an IP address conflict, so change the IP address of your clone if you're using static IPs for VMs.  Linked clones should save some disk space while avoiding the performance hit of ZFS.\n", "Q: Faces from Aperture synced over OS X and iPhone in their Contacts? I have faces in the images of Aperture. I would like to use the faces there for my Contacts in OS X and iPhone.

Each switch is connected to the router. The two devices are not connected to the same switch. With this configuration, the devices are not able to communicate with each other through Bonjour. Using their IPs, on the other hand, works like a charm.\nNow if I connect one of the devices directly to the router, everything is working fine.\nIs this a Bonjour limitation? If so, it doesn't make much sense to me. What's the rationale behind this? Is there any to make this work at all (using additional configuration, in the switches or anything else)?\n\nA: Bonjour is two systems running together: mDNS (Multicast DNS) and DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery).\nmDNS allows hosts (devices/computers) to be identified, while DNS-SD allows them to publish what services they are running.\nMulticast DNS, as the name suggests, relies on IP Multicast, and specifically the multicast IP 224.0.0.251 (IPv4) or ff02::fb (IPv6) (in your case, most likely the former). It seems DNS-SD works over unicast between clients.\nI suspect the problem is likely in the forwarding of multicast packets. Some switches/routers will not pass broadcast/multicast packets between some network interfaces.\nIn the simplest case, for example, you don't want broadcasts/multicasts from your own local network going out to the web. In a large corporate environment, you may want to limit such traffic to defined organisational units or groups of computers.\nAt a guess I'd say your switches/router are configured to either block multicast packets going 'upstream' (to the router) or (possibly) limit the number of hops (not actually sure if that's possible). I'm not familiar with the Netgear switches, but a quick google search suggests there's a configuration option called 'Block Unknown MultiCast Address'. You may want to try disabling this in the switches, and/or specifying 244.0.0.251 as a 'known' address if that's possible.\nIt may be that in the specific configuration (device1 - switch - router - switch - device2) the switches don't think the router is participating in the 244.0.0.251 multicast, and so doesn't bother forwarding out that port. The router may be doing the same for the switches, or may not be multicast aware.\nIt could be educational to try connecting one switch to the other, rather than each via the router. They may 'play nicer' when directly connected together (just a guess though, and probably not helpful for your intended deployment).\nThis discussion could also be helpful to better understanding the multicast limitations of those switches too.\n", "Q: File browser alternatives with remote connections I have been linux person for 6 years, now converting to mac world. \nI am looking for the file browser, which would enable me to:\n\n\n*\n\n*delete files and folders by pressing delete\n\n*rename files by shortcut or right mouse button\n\n*enter folders by pressing \"Enter\"\n\n*navigating in the tree by shortcuts (keyboard only)\n\n\nand also importantly:\n\n\n*\n\n*do the same things on REMOTE linux servers, especially edit files on the fly\n\n*open remote text files in my favorite editor (whichever I want, such as Sublime)\n\n\nIn Ubuntu, I just typed to the directory address ssh://name@server and file system acted completely the same way as if I was on the local computer.

How can I limit the internet access to only learning sites I choose (like Study Island or Plato)?\n\nA: This sounds like you need something that will limit the MacBooks to an allowed \"white list\" of web sites, which you set up.  (\"White list\" is the opposite of \"black list\", which is when you set up a list of web sites that are not allowed.)\nYou might be able to use the built-in OS X Parental Controls system... go to Apple menu > System Preferences > Parental Controls.\nApple has some documentation on Parental Controls here, which includes the picture below: see the \"Allow access to only these websites\" button.\n\n\nA: I would go with Ashley on this, parental controls allow you to whitelist certain sites that you want the students to use.   This also keeps them from stumbling around sites that may be designed to take advantage of students trying to research common questions used in the learning process. \nSetting the machines up with a Guest Account with Parental Controls enabled prevents the students from saving anything to the machine as the local files are wiped with each logout.  It doesn't prevent them from transferring items like tests, or research to the instructor via a drop box.   (you can also prevent them from sharing with each other)  It also allows you to log all activity if you have concerns about a student.\n\nA: The easy way: The shareware web browser iCab (20USD) [icab.de] has a kiosk mode that allows an admin to blacklist and whitelist sites. It also allows to set blacklisted words a user can input into text-fields, such as you would find in search engines. These features only affect user while iCab is in the kiosk mode and user cannot exit kiosk mode except by password set by admin. In kiosk mode user cannot access other applications.\nAnother way:\nOtherwise you can edit the hosts file [/private/etc/hosts] (admin privileges required).\nExample, to block the site, example.com, you would input:\n\n127.0.0.1    example.com\n\nor block an ip address:\n\n127.0.0.1    192.168.1.1\n\nMake sure you make a backup of the hosts file before you attempt to change anything in it.\n", "Q: How do I make keyboard viewer to automatically show up only when I'm holding the option key?

I use gif brewry, and it seems to generate very large animated gif files; i'm looking to reduce their size - how do I do that?\n\nA: I’d say there are basically three things that impact the file size of a GIF. \n\n\n*\n\n*The number of colors in the GIF — The more colors there are in a GIF, the higher the file size. \n\n*The dimensions of the GIF — Tumblr requires the width to be less than 500px, so at least start there. I think around 450px is a great size. However, don’t forget you can use the crop feature to just highlight the action.\n\n*The number of frames — The number of frames you can use is highly dependent on the above two points. \nThe three items above mirror the advice that the vendor gives and you can use the GifBrewery preferences to help reduce the colors by processing it lightly or using dithering algorithms:\n\n", "Q: How can I get the iPhone Podcast app to resume playback after extended stop? I noticed a while ago that the music app didn't play podcasts any more and that a (new?) podcast app does that.\nThe result is that when I now listen to a podcast and stop it with the button on the headphones and then try to restart it some time later, the iPhone plays music from the music app instead.\nIn the old days when podcasts were in the music app, the podcast would continue playing.\nHow can I get the old behaviour back, i.e. I want the iPhone to continue playing what it was playing when I last stopped it?\n\nA: The behavior you describe is inconsistent. In my experience, sometimes the podcast will continue and sometimes the iOS device will switch to the music app. I believe (but haven't confirmed) that this depends on whether or not the podcast app, be it Apple's or third party, is still considered active by the system. When it occurs I just open my podcast app and playback of the the last podcast resumes (unless I was streaming it in which case I may have to hit play.)\nBecause this is a memory management issue there is no way to force the behavior you seek using a dedicated podcast app. However, if you uninstall Apple's Podcasts you can continue to download podcasts using iTunes and can move them over to your iOS device with a playlist. This solution is less than ideal—for example you can't download fresh podcasts directly to the device. \niOS 7 UPDATE: It is my understanding that under iOS 7 you no longer have the ability to listen to podcasts from within the Music app. Perhaps better memory management and multitasking will provide resumed playback more consistently, but it seems that a podcast client (or listening via Safari) will be required. \n", "Q: Applications/Xcode vs Developer/Applications/Xcode I have OSX 10.8 with Xcode 4.6.3 installed (it shows under App Store). When I Spotlight-search \"xcode\" I see two results: Xcode – Mac & Xcode – Developer.\nThe first launches as expected, but with the second I get the following warning: \"This installation of Xcode 4.2 requires Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Install a version of the Xcode Tools that supports Mac OS X 10.8.\" and it quits instantly. Same if I try to launch via finder at Developer/Applications/Xcode.\nI find this confusing - why does the app show twice and is there a way of removing the non-functioning version?\nTo further complicate matters, I have a folder Developer-3.2.4 containing this version of Xcode which also shows in Spotlight results - I followed a tutorial to keep an older version of Xcode when the buggy new version 4 was released. I assume I can safely delete that now?\n\nA: You seem to have upgraded your system with older versions of Xcode present on it and missed uninstalling Xcode 4.2 while installing Xcode 4.3.\nXcode from version 4.3 onwards installs under /Applications. Only versions older than this (like your Xcode 4.2) install under /Developer. If you do not plan to boot OS X Lion from another disk/partition and use Xcode 4.2, you can safely uninstall it (do not just delete the folder from Finder).\nTo uninstall Xcode 4.2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal.app)\n\n*Type the command sudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\nTo uninstall your Xcode 3.2.4 under /Developer-3.2.4:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal.app)\n\n*Type the command sudo /Developer-3.2.4/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all\nReference:\nHow to remove Xcode from your Mac\n", "Q: How can I effectively hide my macbook while traveling to prevent theft I will be taking my Macbook Pro Retina for a backpacking trip and will be working from public places (i.e. coffee shops, public squares) for a while. I am quite concerned though, that it will be stolen. \nAside from the obvious precautions for theft, like not leaving it out of eyesight, backing everything up to a second disk, encrypting stuff, firmware password, setting up prey etc. I am looking for a way to disguise the machine as something more undesirable than a macbook.\nOf course there is always the Book Cover disguise or the option to cover the whole thing in conference stickers so it looks like a piece of trash, but maybe you guys know something equally suitable for this purpose?\n\nA: Searching on the web for \"laptop skin\" or \"removable laptop skin\" would provide you a list of designers and sellers for laptop skins.

My problem is that when I go to that newly-created space, it's a copy of the existing cluttered original desktop. How do I create a blank desktop?\n\nA: The point of spaces is that they allow for different collections and configurations of application windows, and they do not allow for having different desktops; the desktop is not a window.\nThe desktop icons shown are simply file and folder items at a file system level that are displayed without requiring to be viewed through an application window. There is only a single desktop folder per user.\nTaking both of these into account, what you want can't work for a number of reasons\n\nA: I totally get it. And, 5 years later ... this is still not an option.\nRegardless...\nAs a solution, my approach was to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*move everything from the desktop into a folder\n\n*set that folder to display as icons\n\n*set that folder to hide the sidebar and toolbar\n\n*expand the folder to display fullscreen in it's own space\n\n\nYou could even go a step further and add alias's to your hard drive and then instruct the finder to hide it.\nYou can also set the background to use your desktop wallpaper to mirror what you are used to seeing on your desktop.\n\nA: You can't do this via Mission Control - your desktop files are available on ALL desktops. The different desktops may only contain different open applications. \nIf you want a clean desktop, move the individual files where they make sense (or into the trash), or put them all in a folder.\n\nA: Hover over the icon/program at the bottom of your screen that continues to reappear even when you change desktops.  Next, select options, then select \"none\" under assign to.  This will solve your problem\n", "Q: How to fix when Apple Mail fails to display new Exchange Imap e-mail messages?

Therefore start the Exchange System Manager application, and open the path \"Administrative Groups\" > \"First Administrative Group\" > \"Servers\" > Server > Protocols > IMAP4.\n\n\nIn our case the \"Default IMAP4 Virtual Server\" repeatedly stopped itself.\nAfter starting the \"Default IMAP4 Virtual Server\", the new mail started arriving in the Mail.app application.\n", "Q: Unable to Perform Name Resolution My MacBook Pro, for some reason, detects the wireless connection, but I cannot go to a web page using Safari. I can open the iTunes Store, but cannot access my email. I ran the Network Assistant and it reflects that my connection is good. I tried putting in a manual IP address but my computer is still unable to perform name resolution to go to any web page. My home WiFi uses a WEP password, and configure IPv4 using DHCP.\nI went to a local McDonald's to see if I could access the Internet with their free WiFi - my MacBook connected immediately and went out to several websites with no issues.\nNote:\nI went through all of the steps as listed in this answer on June 30, 2012 with this very same situation but am still not able to open a Web Page.\n\nA: It sounds like the MacBook connection problems only happen when you have blocked the kiddo's x-box, correct?\nDoes removing the X-Box block allow you to connect to web and email?\nIf so, the problem is likely happening because of DHCP.  DHCP means the router hands out IP addresses.  Usually, DHCP will hand out IP addresses in the order that devices connect to the router. \n\nFor Example:\n1st - 192.168.0.1 -> MacBook\n2nd - 192.168.0.2 -> X-Box  [BLOCKED]\n\nNow lets say the kid reboots the router while you are away.  Now the X-Box connects to wifi first and gets the first IP address. When you get home you get the second [blocked] address \nFor Example:\n1st - 192.168.0.1 -> X-Box \n2nd - 192.168.0.2 [BLOCKED]-> MacBook  \nSetting up your MacBook with a manual address (DHCP with manual address ) might work... but only if you chose an unused IP address in the \"proper IP address range\" for your router.\nIf the above is similar to your situation ... The solution to this depends on the make and model of your router.\nMy router has an option for \"DHCP with reserved addresses\".  This will reserve and assign a specific IP address to a specific device.Example: 192.168.0.8 -[BLOCKED] [RESERVED for X-Box] .\nThe \"reservations\" are based on a device's \"MAC Address\". The \"MAC address\" is a unique \"serial number\" for the for a devices WiFi or ether (MAC address is nothing to due with MAC OS.)\nAnother option is to set the IPs manually but this would could be a pain... There may be other options depending on the make and model of your router.\nPlease let us know more about your router and router setup.\n", "Q: Accessing a PDF stored in iBooks (on a jailbroken device) On a jailbroken iPad, I was looking for a way to access a particular PDF from iBooks.

Is there a way to update ALL your software at same time with one click?\nFrom what I was told you have to update MS Office and other softwares manually and on by one.\n\nA: The closest thing I have found is the MacUpdate Desktop utility. It does not handle every application, but it handles most of them. The program to do the updating is free, but the service it consults to know what apps need updating is a paid program.\n\nA: In a word, no.\nDifferent software is installed by different methods, depending on where you bought it from, who wrote it, how old it is and numerous other variables.\nApple tried their best to get a handle on this through the Mac App Store, which allows you to simultaneously update any app purchased through it, and the OS with a single update click, but not all apps are available on the App Store, because they are too old, are simply not offered by their respective developers, or perhaps they offer functionality that is banned from appearing in the App Store, or break it's rules on Sandboxing etc such that they are not allowed.\nMacupdate offers an update utility that tries to keep track of updates and pull them down for you, but it can only support the apps that it is allowed to support, and as such is in the same boat at the App Store etc.\nSome apps simply run an update check upon startup (check preferences per app) to see if a new version is available, others write in their own update tools, others use 3rd party distribution and update tools like Sparkle to do it for them etc.\nIn short, on OS X, it's a free for all.  There is no way to combine or encapsulate all software updates in a single method.\n\nA: No - there is no combined update process that works for all conceivable let alone all existing (or even popular) software.\nBut you can automate the Apple updates and use a third party app to automate the Mac App Store updates.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can Mac App Store installs & upgrades be automated?\nThat way two pieces of automation can be chained together to meet your goals.\nDiving deeper, there are all sorts of MDM / endpoint management suites like Munki and commercial ones like JAMF Pro that set up a framwork to automate this at scale remotely for an out of the box management toolchain when combined with Apple DEP.\nYou could go the managed route and have a script that pushes out updates for you like a school lab or corporation might choose to do.\nOne of the reasons why Apple has said it introduced the App Store model to OS X is to combat this level of complexity for many users - especially for those new to Mac. For apps that are distributed from the App Store and supplied as Apple products, there is in fact a one click Update button that works for both OS updates and App Store updates.\nIn your case, MS Office is not included in this easy deployment scenario (yet and perhaps ever) so the ease of updating App Store apps won't help you.\n\nA: Microsoft Office for Mac includes an auto update app. Under Help in the Menu bar when you have any Office for Mac app open you can select to \"Check for Update\". When the window appears select Automatically. You can select Daily, Weekly or Monthly.\n", "Q: Retina Macbook is emitting a noise from under keyboard The noise is not coming from the speakers and appears to be coming from the left side of the keyboard.

The company, Coriolis, finally closed in 2019. There is still a (now essentially freeware/donationware) version of iPartition available for download, but only good to OS X 10.13 for pre CoreStorage disks.\nIt allows you to move and resize partitions without deleting any data. It also works for Boot Camp volumes and other PC disks.\n\nWith iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Disk Utility can do non-destructive partitioning (add or remove) but cannot move partitions.\nThis functionality was added in Lion, I believe.\nThe key is to click on the right thing.

I would like to buy an unlocked iPhone 5 or iPhone 5s, and use it with the Aio Basic plan from Aio Wireless, an AT&T prepaid subsidiary launched in mid-2013.\nOn their web-site, Aio Basic @ 40 USD/mo is described as including 250MB of unlimited data at 4G and 4G LTE speed (with throttling after you reach the limit), but is annotated to be \"Basic phones only\"; whereas Aio Smart @ 55 USD/mo is described as having 2GB of unlimited data, but it said to be \"Basic or Smartphones\".\nProvided I don't mind being throttled after 250MB/mo for getting the savings, will Aio Basic work for my basic iPhone 5 or 5s?\n\nA: Yes, it would appear that this is allowed, but only as long as you go the Bring-Your-Own-Device route.\nIn the Bring Your Own Device option of ordering the 40$/mo Aio Basic plan, you can search for Apple iPhone 5 and, subsequently, select the Nano SIM Card option (the only option available), where they will also ask you for your IMEI number.\nThis also has been confirmed by a service representative through the online chat function:  you cannot purchase an iPhone 5 together with the 40$/mo plan, but as long as you bring your own device, going with the 40$/mo plan is completely OK.  They also claim that the throttling past the allotment would be down to 256kbps, although this is not written anywhere on the web-site itself so far.\nAt 40$/mo, this plan would be more expensive and with less data that T-Mobile USA's online prepaid special 30$/mo 100 minutes + unlimited data with 5GB @ 4G plan (available only online and through Walmart), but it's still a great deal for what it is.\n\nA: You can use an AT&T iPhone 5s on Aio wireless as well. No unlocking required. I got the iPhone 5s on launch day from Apple and went right to my local Aio wireless store here in Tampa, Florida...signed up for service, popped in their SIM card and wah-la!

Try applying the most recent OS X update (10.14.6) and trying again. Software being out of date is a usual suspect of things not working as expected. All of the devices you are accessing the Stream on would need to be current as well. \n", "Q: Can I store and run applications on an external drive? I am thinking of getting a this MacBook but the hard drive space is not sufficient. I was wondering if I bought an external hard drive for it would i be able to download apps and things onto it.\n\nA: Yes - OS X doesn't care where you store apps for them to run.\nSimilarly, most programs don't force you to store all documents in one place.\nYou shouldn't expect to seamlessly have everything move from the internal storage to the external storage, but caring older files and larger files on a sometimes disconnected drive is a long held idiom for working with computers.\n\nA: You can store and run applications in the non-standard /Application location on OS X, which means you can keep things on your external drive and run them from there.\nYou just have to be aware of the limitations of doing it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*The applications and data on the drive won't be available when it's not connected.Seems obvious but this can come up in surprising ways so I think it's worth saying here. Let's say, for example, that you have a text editor installed on your external drive and it's the default application for text files. When you double click on a text file when the drive is not connected you'll get an error about the application not being found. You'll need to right click and select an alternate application in that case.\n\n*The bandwidth, especially the sustained rates, for accessing the data and applications on this drive is limited to the connection method.For Thunderbolt it's pretty darn good but still not as good as a drive in the machine. For USB it's hit and miss. It depends a lot on the USB chipset used in the drive and what else is sharing the USB buss. Most applications will load resident in to memory when you launch them so for applications on an external USB drive you'll have some start up latency and that's it. But if you have to access a lot data or if the application loads itself in pieces as you access different features, you might find the I/O wait tedious. Expect beachballs here and there for sure.\n\n\nMost applications can be safely relocated to the external drive by dragging them from /Applications to the new location on the remote storage. Applications are bundled in a nicely self-contained way. Note though that relocation the applications .app bundle from /Applications to the remote drive only moves the bundle. The configuration and ancillary data the application uses, generally found in /Library or ~/Library will remain on your primary drive. That data is harder to move. It's also usually smaller than the application bundle.\n", "Q: Back up of ITunes This may seem a silly question... but ITunes when synced with my Iphone, only backs up into my main PC correct?

When someone uses my Apple ID on another PC for Itunes and syncs or backs up their IPOD or phone only the music will download yes? Not the SMS messages or photos? Those are stored on my hard drive?\nI ask only because someone was able to use my ICloud to sync to my phone with their Ipod and pulled all my text messages etc off of it. I get that on the Cloud its a shared thing but anything that was synced to my Itunes (other than what was on my ICloud) would stay in the primary computer hard drive? \nI have looked everywhere thru forums to answer this question as basic as it seems. Im probably overthinking it all. \n\nA: It's not a silly question because syncing and sharing are complicated.\niCloud is able to sync across devices: Safari bookmarks, reading list, open tabs; calendars, reminders, tasks; contacts; documents; mail, notes; the newest 1000 photos; keychain passwords (soon); iTunes music, movies, TV shows, apps, and books. (That is the short list!)\nSo, depending on the devices' settings, someone with your Apple ID and password could gain access to any of this stuff. Therefore, take care of your passwords and make them great.\niTunes does store your stuff on the device but turning on iCloud means you will share it. Go to iCloud.com, sign it and take a look. Take a look at iCloud preferences (properties) or settings.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure I get what you are looking for, but let me present two ideas and see if that helps you resolve your questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can take one iOS device and connect it to n different iTunes - each of which would make a full backup of the device. You don't need to sync to back up, and the device can require that iTunes encrypt the backup. Furthermore, if your device has a passcode, iTunes cannot back things up until that passcode is presented (or if that computer already syncs to the device and has a key to begin syncing even when the passcode has the device locked).\n\n*Backup to iCloud is 100% independent of backup to iTunes. One can be on and the other can still happen and turning on or off iCloud backup doesn't go and erase any backups that exist on any computer. That computer also won't sync that backup to iCloud as the files are stored outside the cloud locally.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4946\n", "Q: iPad children's storybook with audio: is there a way to create a paid iBook AND free version? I've been researching what it would take to create a children's storybook (including custom audio containing music and narration as well as moving imagery) and publish it on the iPad.\nI discovered that I can accomplish this using iBooks by making an ePUB using CSS for the images, JS for any animation and custom read-aloud recordings for the music/narration.\nNow I'm faced with another hurdle: I want the digital book to be accessible for free to those who already purchased a physical version of the book (probably using some kind of authentication code).\nI'm a PHP programmer/designer who's very familiar with most Apple technologies. I don't know Obj-C, but if I have no other recourse than to be make an app, I will build one.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You may wish to avoid using iBooks Author (iBA) and the iTunes store for distribution since what you seek to do (provide a free download to paying customers that pay elsewhere) violates Apple's guidelines that each SKU either be paid (and paid through an AppleID and Apple's payment system) or free to all who wish to download it.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5071\nThere is nothing preventing you from controlling the distribution of a generic  source file that's PDF or ePub format and using whatever payment system you want. Also, as long as your work is free - you can use iBA even distribute PDF/ibooks files outside the App Store ecosystem. In both these cases, your customers would then be free to choose to consume your work using iBooks or other apps as they choose. You will be bypassing Apple's DRM, review, code-signing and customer handling (billing, first level support, account setup, etc…) so there seems to be little avenue you will have to control each person from re-sharing your work and you'll probably need to spend significant energy and time to implement a framework from which you build your multimedia ePub book if you choose to go without the iBooks Author packaging and authoring system.\nYou should be in the clear to use iBooks Author to craft your paid book for distribution through Apple's channels and reevaluate whether you need to somehow offer those books for free rather than gifting them. You might need a lawyer or to work with Apple to determine what modifications would be needed for you to have a paid work for sale and a free work for distribution to your paying customers. I would guess you would be in violation of the license terms of iBooks Author if you were selling one version and made a second version that had trivial changes and was distributed outside the store to get around the pricing intentions Apple has established.\n", "Q: As a novice user how can I reinstall an old Mac? I have used IBM PCs, and clones, professionally from 1981 until I retired in 1999.\nI have never owned/used a Mac. \nMy neighbor gave me his older Mac (I think he bought it 5 years ago).\nI want to clean it up, get rid of music and apps that I will never use, rename it, setup up networking etc.\nWhere can I find out how to do it?\n\nA: Technically this isn't an answer, but it's way to long for a comment.  If you come back with more details I will tailor the answer to suit your circumstances.\n\nWhere can you find out?  Asking here is a great start :)  I'll try to put some pointers your way below, but if you have the time and money, then I highly recommend the \"Missing Manual\" books (a different one exists for each version of the OS) which are probably the most comprehensive and accessible of any Mac user guides I have seen and read.\nIt would be really useful to know exactly what model the machine is, and what the current OS level is to understand any possible upgrade options etc.\nAssuming you can log in and use it in any capacity, then click the apple logo in the top left of your screen, directly under that click About This Mac, you should get a box like this:\n\nThis gives us basic information about the machine, it's CPU and RAM (which will let us understand what OS is is capable of running) and it's current OS Level.\nThe best way to prep the machine is to wipe it clean and install the OS from scratch\nIf you got any install DVDs with the machine (they will have been supplied but whether they have made it to you 5 years later is another matter) you can factory reset the device to it's original state with those, but there is every chance that whatever it is currently running is newer than what it was supplied with originally.\nIf you don't have the discs, then you need to get some.  However it's not quite that simple, as these days all OS installs and upgrades are downloaded from the internet.  If your current OS is not 10.6.8 or higher, then you don't have access to the Mac App Store which is where you can purchase the upgrade from.  If it's 10.6.<8 that you can at least upgrade the machine to 10.6.8 by simply running software update (Apple logo > Software Update).  If you are on 1.05.x or earlier, this process is harder, but it can be done.\nAssuming your machine will support it I would recommend running the latest available OS.  It's not expensive ($30 or so?) and will provide the best experience f you are new to Macs.  Now, there's every chance that either you don't want to for some reason, or are already on the most recent version (as per my screenshot) etc.  If you are on 10.7 or above you can try a re-install using the recovery partition which should allow you to wipe everything clean and start again.  No point adding instructions until we know what you are on or what you want to do, but we can clarify later how to do this.\nLastly, without touching the OS, there is a quick way to at least get the thing running with default settings on the current version you have which is to create a new user account, and log into that instead of whatever you are using now.  Click Apple > System Preferences... > Users and Groups and add a new user:\n\nWhen you login as the new user all the settings and such will be as if you had installed the OS from scratch, but there may be non standard applications still available etc if they existed before, and other users files and settings will still be taking up disk space etc.\n", "Q: Is there a way to access and stream one's iTunes music collection from a web browser? Does the possibility exist to access one's iTunes music collection from any web browser? e.g. to browse the library and stream the songs.\n\nA: One possibility : \nMoving your iTunes library to your ~/Sites/ directory and enable files sharing. \nWith this your the content of your library will be accessible from your browser with your ip ( http://myip/~MyUsername/ ) \n\nA: Use Plex, it's free and awesome.

The web interface is initially only available internally on your home network, however if you register at http://www.StreamMyiTunes.com then you can log in to your home computer's iTunes from anywhere.\nAlso has a built in DLNA server so I've been able to replace quite a few different programs with just this one.\nhttp://www.bizmodeller.com/iHomeServer/iHomeServer-Access-iTunes-From-The-Internet.aspx\n\nA: you can only open iTunes app from browser by going to this link : https://itunes.apple.com/store/\nyou can't get the music lists...\n", "Q: For iOS developers, are GM releases eligible for OTA updates on point releases? The iOS 7 betas are the first set of OS betas I've been through as a member of the Developer Program. Manually installing the beta releases is one thing, but now that a GM has been released will the 7.0.1 release be available to the GM build installed as an OTA update? Or will I have to install that from the image manually, and then get OTA updates for version 7.0.2 and onward?\n\nA: Yes. Excluding any major issues, the GM release for developers is the same as the first release to the public. Future point releases can be updated over-the-air rather than through a manual image install.\n", "Q: Trouble accessing the OS X Lion web server from other device I'm developing a web app for mobile phones. To easily get a feel of how it is to use, I simply copied the app into ~/Sites (after enabling web sharing in the System Preferences).\nNavigating to http://localhost/~username/myapp.html works perfectly. But if I do an ifconfig to get my IP address and navigate to the URL from my iPhone (substituting localhost with the IP address), I get an Error 404. How can I troubleshoot and resolve this issue?\n\nA: If you put it in the \n~/Sites\nFolder then you have to navigate to\n192.168.0.1/~USERNAME\nWhere you substitute your IP address and the username that belongs to the ~/Sites folder you copied your web app to.\nTo get it to just recognize the IP address without the username subfolder put it here:\n/Library/Webserver/Documents\nEG NOT the library folder in your home folder but the library folder in the root of the hard drive.\n", "Q: Apple TV and Podcasts I have an Apple TV 2, the one with a max of 720p. If I decide to upgrade to an Apple TV 3 for its 1080p goodness (or an Apple TV 4 in the future if/when it's released), when I log in with my Apple ID, will my list of favorite Podcasts transfer over? Or will I need to add them all over again?\n\nA: I think it does. Because of iCloud, the stuff in your Apple account will transfer to other devices. For example, if I enable app-sharing with iCloud on my iPhone and I download Temple Run, Temple RUn will also be downloaded into my iPad too. so I think that this will work with the Apple TV 3.\n", "Q: Checking the security over WLAN I've become majorly concerned when reading this article that describes a bad actor that use Terminal access from his/her Mac to change the syslog and have stealth access to all data and passwords.\nHow can I get sure when I am connecting WLAN of workplace nobody can hack my computer and if they did by any chance(having password) how can I hinder them?\nI don't even get how an OS could have two sys logs, so how can I get sure others have no access to my data? I am scared I might leave my Mac unattended sometimes.\n\nA: They key to your particular concern about the system is that an intruder would require local access to your Mac in the first instance in order to use the terminal to redirect syslog messages elsewhere (or perform any other nefarious activities that may allow genuine remote network access at a later date).  The log redirection is a secondary \"intrusion\" that may allow someone to see the contents of your log files (which can contain some sensitive information, but I would never expect to see passwords in there).  It isn't giving access to your system, but to your log files etc.\nThe link you provide is a litany of random sounding events, which all span in reality from 1 person gaining local access to your machine.  This is the key here.  Set a screensaver, and require a password to unlock it.  Use Filevault to encrypt your boot drive to prevent booting from another disc or partition and gaining access to your data.  Don't use auto-login for any user account.  Set a strong password that is not used elsewhere.  Do this, and almost everything you mention or that is mentioned in the link is not possible to achieve.  To be clear, that machine was not \"hacked\", it sounds far more likely that social engineering or simply using the computer while the owner was not present due to lax security was at fault.\nRest easy, do the above and just concentrate on physical access for now.\nIf you are still concerned about remote intrusion then Apple's Mac OS X Security Configuration Guides provide additional suggestions for hardening your Macintosh against intrusion, however you should proceed with caution, as security often compromises usability, and some of the measures may be too extreme for your purposes and prone to causing you more problems than they solve, not to mention the fact that they can often be reverted through OS software updates without you being aware... \n", "Q: Why does my MacBook audio output have no sound when connected to a stereo component? I have a problem with my MacBook Pro (10.5.8) - the audio output has no sound when connected to a stereo component, but when connected to small speakers it works fine. Internal speakers are working also. Does anyone have an idea?\n\nA: You seem to have isolated the issue to the stereo component. If it expects line in signal, you might need a device like the Griffin iMic to provide line level sound.\nAlso, setting the volume lower might make the input low enough to not trip a protection on the stereo, but usually line level is higher than speaker/headphone level so that might not help at all.\n", "Q: How to diagnose Address Book quitting unexpectedly? When opening Address Book, it quits before it opens. The window says:\nAddress Book quit unexpectedly. Click `Reopen` to open the application again. \nClick `Report` to see more detailed information and send a report to Apple.\n\nWhat's the best solution? How can I diagnose this problem?\n\nA: You can click on the Report button and look though all the gibberish to see if there is something informative or suspicious there.\nYou could run the Console program and search for \"Address\" in the upper right to check for error messages.\nYou could try accessing your contacts from within the Mail program and check near the top and bottom of the list for any missing or weird entries.\nYou could turn on iCloud syncing (if you already have it on, back up) and see if you can access your full contact list from the web interface.\nYou could check for System Updates and hope there is a new update (Mavericks soon!) of the Contacts app.\n** If you ever do get it to open, you should back up your contacts immediately (Export...> Contacts Archive) just in case.\n\nA: It's possible that the problem exists with the data in your home directory. Try creating a new account on your system, or log in with the guest account. Then run Address Book on the new account.\nIf Address Book works normally with another user account on your system, then the Address Book data in your home directory is the the likely cause of the crash. If Address Book fails the same way on another account, then the application or the system is at fault.\nTwo resources in your home directory affecting Address Book launch are the preferences file and the contacts database. Please note that if you modify either of these resources, the change may be permanent and data loss may result.\nYou didn't specify which version of OS X you have, so I'm going to provide information relevant to OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion which I am currently running.\nPreferences file: \n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.AddressBook.plist\nContacts database:\n~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/\nIf you feel comfortable making such changes, try renaming one or both of these items (the first is a file, the second is a folder).

This is different from ExitTimeOut, which is used by Launchd to send a KILL signal to the job. Your specific requirement should be implemented within your job.\nFrom a post in June 2010 in the Darwin-Kernel mailing list:\nRe: What is TimeOut (\"idle time out\") in launchd?\n\nThis specifies the idle exit timeout. If your daemon hasn't received a request in this amount of time, it should quit. Notably launchd does not implement this for you; it's up for you to implement the timeout in your daemon's main event loop.\n\n\nA: From the Mac Developer Library: launchd.plist(5) Mac OS X Manual Page\n\nTimeOut <integer>\n  The recommended idle time out (in seconds) to pass to the job. If no value is specified, a default time out will be\n  supplied by launchd for use by the job at check in time.\n\nIt's the recommended idle timeout.\nSee also: Daemons and Services Programming Guide: Creating Launch Daemons and Agents\n", "Q: Downgrading an iOS application - how to download a previous version?

Logging is available for many actions by checking out your console app and taking a look at contents, but it's down to each app to decide what level of system logging is needs to do to be useful.  Increased logging is very useful to aid in debugging and to understand user problems, but at the cost of the management and performance hits of dealing with enormous log files.

I'm planning on upgrading my 120GB HDD to a 128GB SSD but I'm not sure which SSD will be compatible with my MacBook.\nMy specs: MacBook late 2007 / Santa Rosa 2.2GHz / 4GB RAM\nPreferably, I'd like to get the fastest SSD that would be compatible for my MacBook but the SATA versions have been updated three times since this MacBook was released I'm not sure which would be the best.\n\nA: I upgraded a similar era Macbook a while ago.  In all likelihood you are unlikely to be able to buy an SSD that will not max out the BUS speed available to it on a machine that old.\nThat particular Macbook has a SATA I (1.5Gbps) interface for it's existing hard drive.  SATA III (6Gbps) SSD drives have been the standard for many years now, although you may be able to get a bargain bucket SATA II device (3Gbps).  Basically, I would get the cheapest SSD you can for the capacity you require that is at least SATA II (you don't need it for the speed, but a SATA I one will be based on older technology that may have a shorter lifespan than a newer drive).  It is almost certain to be faster than your machine can handle, so there is no point getting a particularly recent or fast one.\n\nA: I upgraded a similar Macbook a while back and can heartily recommend that you should do it. Even with the SATA bus not being able to take advantage of the faster SATA II or III speeds your macbook will boot up in seconds and operate much faster. Best \"make my mac faster\" upgrade you can do.\nOne thing to note, I experienced a REDUCTION in battery life when moving from the stock Apple HD to the OWC SSD. I ended up with about 3+ hours of usable battery life where before I had 4+ hours.\nAfter installing the SSD it would be a good idea to reset the SMC as per this Apple KB article\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964\nWhen I first installed the SSD I was getting about 2 hours of battery life on a brand new (3rd party) battery.

I have a MacBook Air (2013) and I would like to run (that is, boot into) Windows without creating a partition for it. I also want to keep it mobile within an office area, so I would prefer not to use an external HD or flash drive.\nIs it possible to use NetBoot to boot into Windows via WiFi?\n\nA: There are two questions here: can you netboot anything via WiFi, and can you netboot windows? \nHistorically netbooting over WiFi has been problematic. This may have been fixed in recent models (my newest computer isn't). If you can netboot via WiFi you can boot anything that is netbootable.\nNow for netbooting windows. Pre-EFI windows probably won't work unless you use weird tricks like using bootcamp to load a linux boot loader off another partition and use it to load ipxe from disk to load older operating systems from the network, but this makes wifi even more difficult. Netbooting WindowsPE works well but reboots at around 70 hours, Other versions of windows may be possible to net boot with iscsi but I have not tried.\n", "Q: Change Security & Privacy setting from terminal I need to enable the \"Require an administrator password to access locked preferences\" on about a dozen Macs.

I need the laptop now, so I will have to buy it tomorrow ...\n\nA: The physical MagSafe adapter remains unchanged from a pinout perspective (the shape has altered externally from a T shape to an L shape and back again) for almost every Macbook except the 2012 Macbook Air and Retina Macbook which use MagSafe 2; Adapters are available to connect a MagSafe power supply to these machines, but you cannot use a MagSafe 2 adapter to power anything other than the 2012 Air and Retina at present.\nYou need to ensure that you use the correct power rated charger for the Macbooks.  Macbook Airs use a 45 watt supply, through to something like 85 watts for Macbook Pros.\nIt's OK to use a higher rated supply than is required, the charger only supplies what is asked of it, so a Macbook Air on a Pros power supply will only request its 45 watts, not get fried with 85 watts.\nConversely, it's not OK to do the opposite, running a MBP on an Airs power supply will request up to 85 watts of draw on a 45 watt power supply, and burn out the adapter eventually.\n", "Q: How to turn off iOS Calendar Notifications for iCloud shared calendars How can I turn off alerts for iCloud calendars that have been shared with me?

My son forgot his password, and he didn't want his iPhone anymore, but I wanted to erase the device before selling/recycling it.\nThe broken power button (also called the \"sleep/wake\" button) makes this difficult - normally you'd hold down the power & home buttons simultaneously while connected to iTunes via USB, all the way through a power cycle, through the apple logo's appearance, until it shows you the Recovery Mode screen as shown here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201412\nWithout a working power button, a variation is necessary.  What I did was use the Assistive Touch feature, which my son had already turned on months before, since the power button wasn't working.  Plug the device into a computer with iTunes loaded.  Hold down the \"Lock Screen\" button (in the \"Device\" submenu) for a few seconds until the power-off slider is shown.  Then, while holding down the Home button, slide the power-off slider to the right - keep holding the Home button for a long time, through the device powering off, through the Apple logo, and until the Recovery Mode screen appears.\nNow follow the prompts in iTunes on the computer, and the device should reset as normal.\n\nA: Here's an idea. Take a magnet, and touch the screen with it. By any luck, the magnet will the trigger the system to erase all the memory, and you can reset it up. But if it doesnt work (because its just an idea and I never tried it), go to an Apple specialist. You may wanna recycle it and probably update it to a better phone, such as the iphone 5s and 5c that is coming out, unless you're collecting old iphones. But still this is an idea and I hope it works and helps for you.\n", "Q: What was the first MacBook that people were able to install Windows on? What was the first MacBook that people were able to install Windows on? \nHow about 2007, 2008 versions of Macbook?\nIt was when Apple started to sell MacBooks with Intel processors instead of PowerPC?\n\nA: Apple introduced Bootcamp in 2006 as a beta for OSX Tiger. (source)\nSo it's since 2006 that the Macbooks are able to install Windows. However a support note specify that the oldest Macbooks aren't compatible with Windows 7. \nNB: Notice that laptops powered by PPC processors were called iBooks & PowerBooks.

However, the email account is set up in preferences.  Library/mail/V2/maildata/accounts.plist lists the account and the Mailboxes are still present under Library/mail/V2/Mailboxes.  However, if I log out as iMac user and log in as another user, Mail works OK for a different email account associated to that user.  Does 10.8.5 limit the number of accounts for emails?  In Console, I get a MailIAPlugin message: \"Tried to get settings for nonexistent account\".  Any idea on how to get Mail to work?    \n\nA: Grayed out Quit in Mail usually indicates that mail is busy doing something (like sync) and does not allow quitting.\nHere are few steps you can do:\n1- Run the Connection doctor\n2- Enable the Activity window to see what is going on (get mail)\n3- Delete that account and recreate it. (no worry, your email should be on the original server (ie gmail), but better check that before.\n4- Wait for it to complete its duty.

When I run git --version I get git version 1.7.12.4 (Apple Git-37), and it seems to be located at /usr/bin/git. I don't remember installing Git, but I did install Command Line Tools for Xcode in order to install Homebrew. Not a full Xcode install — just the command line tools.\nI'm trying to figure out how best to update to a newer Git version, and determining how it was originally installed would be helpful. I think it came with the command line tools installation, but I'm not 100%.\n\nA: Yes, the Command Line Tools package does include /usr/bin/git.

Does anyone have experience using this program for Windows on a Mac? Any suggestions for a better setup than Parallels?\n\nA: You might find an easier solution in Crossover because it doesn't require a complete instance of the Windows Operating System.  I don't know that Master Geneologist is tested, but it would be worth trying. The Codeweavers community is very helpful and supportive of new software packages.\n\nA: Since you have a Mac Pro I guess you have a big hard drive. Why not setting up Boot Camp?\nYou sure can't go wrong with it, everything should work fine when you boot in Windows.\nOther than that, I used to have Parallels, but I switched to VMware Fusion. I think they're pretty much comparable, I just like more the fact that Fusion is less obtrusive than Parallels.\n", "Q: PDF annotation tool for Mac OS What is the Mac OS application that provides most similar function as PDF annotator in Windows? \nI just want a program that enables simple annotating functions in Mac OS. \nOf course, freeware is preferred.\nAdd:\nThank you for recommending Preview. \nBut I need a little more advanced features than Preview.\nAny recommendation?\n\nA: You can use Preview to annotate PDFs, make circles, arrows, texts, and even sign it.\nIt comes with OS X.\n\nA: Preview (which comes with OS X) will do simple annotations.\nIn the toolbar, look for the edit icon: \nClick on this icon, and you'll see a new toolbar appear which lets you create squares, circles, speech bubbles, text notes, sticky notes, and more.\n\nThen you can save the file as normal.\n", "Q: Mount Linux NFS share on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 I am new to using Apple as main OS. I am used to fstab in Linux to keep the mounts for nfs. When I use Go to in Finder to mount nfs://serveripaddress/home/shared I get a permissions error.\nThe below command works from Terminal though:\n    mount -t nfs -o resvport,nolocks,locallocks,intr,soft,wsize=32768,rsize=3276 \\\n        serveripaddress:/home/shared /private/shared\n\nHow can I get this to be mounted each time I log in and vpn to the network where this share resides?\n\nA: I have spent quite a bit of time figuring out automounts of NFS shares in OS X...\nSomewhere along the line, Apple decided allowing mounts directly into /Volumes should not be possible:\n/etc/auto_master (see last line):\n#\n# Automounter master map\n#\n+auto_master        # Use directory service\n/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid\n/home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder\n/Network/Servers    -fstab\n/-          -static\n/-          auto_nfs    -nobrowse,nosuid\n\n/etc/auto_nfs (this is all one line):   \n/Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share\n\nThis will not work (anymore!) though it \"should\".\n$ sudo automount -cv\n...\nautomount: /Volumes/my_mount: mountpoint unavailable\n\nWhat's the solution?\nIt's so easy my jaw dropped when I figured it out.\nBasically, we trick OS X into thinking we're mounting * somewhere else. *\nWhen you're talking about paths in just about any environment, the root folder is the highest path you can reach, whether it's C:\\ (windows) or / (*nix)\nWhen you're at this path, attempting to reach the parent path, via .. will keep you at the root path.\nFor example: /../../../../ is still just /\nBy now, a few of you have already figured it out.\nTL;DR / Solution:\nChange your /etc/auto_nfs config from (this is all one line):\n/Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share\n\nTo (this is all one line):\n/../Volumes/my_mount    -fstype=nfs,noowners,nolockd,noresvport,hard,bg,intr,rw,tcp,nfc nfs://192.168.1.1:/exports/my_share\n\nAnd re-run the automounter:\n$ sudo automount -cv\n...\nautomount: /Volumes/my_mount: mounted\n\n..... there you go! Technically /../Volumes is still /Volumes, but the automounter does not see things that way ;)\nThis configuration persists the mount across restarts, and creates the mountpoint automatically.\nI KNOW, RIGHT?\n\nA: I am also new to OSX. This is how I mounted my Linux share. I used sudo vifs which is apparently the OSX preferred way to edit /etc/fstab. I then entered a mount stanza like the below:\nmyserver:/path/to/files /Users/me/files nfs resvport,bg,async,nfc 0 0\n\nThis works and the mount happens automatically. However I am suffering from the famous show-performance-in-finder issue (copying to server fast on command line but excruciatingly slow in finder). \nThe mount options I used are:\n\n\n*\n\n*resvport - needed to use a low port as expected by Linux server\n\n*bg - the mount will be silently retried in the background if unsuccessful\n\n*async - my attempt to increase performace. man mount_nfs and read the risks.\n\n*nfc - makes UTF-8 characters work properly (man mount_nfs)\n\n\nFor completeness, here is the server-side configuration  in /etc/exports:\n/home/me/files 10.20.30.40(rw,sync,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=100)\n\nHere, 10.20.30.40 should be the IP of the OSX client (assuming you want to restrict the export to that client). My Linux uid/gid are 1000/100. I've used all-squash to convert uid/gid to those I have on Linux because of the OSX differences. This isn't a perfect way to do this but it meets my immediate needs.\n", "Q: Configuring mouse scroll wheel actions How do I configure actions for scroll wheel events on mac?\nSpecifically I'm looking for a way to configure the scroll wheel to change workspaces when a modifier key is pressed.\n(I know BetterTouchTool can be used to configure many actions even for a regular mouse. However, it cannot configure actions that would be triggered by scroll wheel.)\n\nA: You might use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>test</name>\n    <identifier>test</identifier>\n    <autogen>__ScrollWheelToKey__ ScrollWheel::UP, VK_CONTROL |\n    ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_LEFT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L</autogen>\n    <autogen>__ScrollWheelToKey__ ScrollWheel::DOWN, VK_CONTROL |\n    ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::CURSOR_RIGHT, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n", "Q: Mail is sending text attachments rather than including the text inline In My Mac Mail, the messages are going as text attachment, rather than just appearing inline as the mail contents.  How can I make sure that the contents of my mails are not being sent as attachments?\n\nA: I was facing the same problem and figured out what was going wrong.\nIn mail, when you copy or drag the attachment, all text below attachment is treated as attachment hence it converts it to attachment and no text goes to the recipient.\nAll you need to do is in menu bar Edit > Attachment > Always insert attachment at end of message.\nThis will now always copy your attachments to the end and your text will remain safe in email.\n", "Q: The server quit without updating PID file (/usr/local/var/mysql/NAME.pid) I have installed mysql via brew.

It basically doesn't work, because (from my poor understanding) mysqld is now managed by launchd, and it is mysqld_safe. I don't know if actually because of that is different from what you control with mysql.server.\nThe solution I came up with is to not use launchd for mysql from brew.\nRather, I just use the  mysql.server tool to start, stop, and restart mysql.\nIf you want to follow my steps, this is what you need to do:\nlaunchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist\n\nAnd whenever you want to start the mysql server, use mysql.server start.\nIf you actually want to make mysql start at boot time, you can take that plist and copy it, delete the KeepAlice line, replace the string values under ProgramArguments with /usr/local/bin/mysql.server and start.

Is that a hard limit? Why could I not install a 16 GB memory stick in there? Would it work, but only for the first 8 GB? Is there any way around the limit?\n\nA: To pick a random 13\" MBP, such as this one from mid 2012:\nhttp://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.5-13-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html\nThe 8Gb limit seems to be an Apple supported limit, but many people happily report getting 16Gb working fine - see the memory section in the link as well as this page for details.\n\nThe \"Mid-2009\" and \"Mid-2010\" MacBook Pro models support 1066 MHz PC3-8500 DDR3 SO-DIMMs and officially and unofficially support a maximum of 8 GB of RAM with one odd exception.\nSpecifically, as discovered by OWC, the 13-Inch \"Mid-2010\" MacBook Pro models (and only the 13-Inch models) -- the MacBook Pro \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.4 13\" Mid-2010 and \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.66 13\" Mid-2010 identified by MacBookPro7,1 -- can support up to 16 GB of RAM with dual 8 GB memory modules if they are running OS X 10.7.5 or higher, have been updated to use the latest EFI, and are equipped with proper specification memory modules. If running a version of Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard,\" these models only can use 8 GB of RAM.\nThe \"Early 2011\" and \"Late 2011\" MacBook Pro models use faster 1333 MHz PC3-10600 DDR3 SO-DIMMs. They officially support 8 GB of RAM, but OWC has determined that they actually support 16 GB of RAM regardless of the operating system installed, although only the \"Early 2011\" MacBook Pro models are capable of running a version of Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard.\"\nFinally, the \"Mid-2012\" non-Retina Display MacBook Pro models use faster still 1600 MHz PC3-12800 DDR3 SO-DIMMs and likewise officially support 8 GB of RAM, but actually can support as much as 16 GB of RAM. These models do not run versions of OS X prior to OS X 10.7 \"Lion.\"\n\n\nA: I have doubts a 16 GB setup would work. I installed the Crucial scan, and this is what it says:\n\nYour Apple MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013); System specs as shipped by the manufacturer; Maximum memory: 16384MB *Not to exceed manufacturer supported memory.\n\nOk, that's understandable to have a disclaimer like that, but this was what it said next:\n\"All memory and storage is soldered on-board.\" wha-wha-what!? \n\n\nA: Just installed 2x8Gb memory modules to Macbook Pro 13 inch (mid-2012), it works great. \n", "Q: Do I have to downgrade from iOS 7 Beta in order to get iOS 7 today? I downloaded the iOS 7 Beta about a week ago and now I'm worried I'll have to downgrade in order to install iOS 7 that's being released today. Anyone have any insight? If I have to downgrade, what's the easiest way?\n\nA: You will have to download the GM seed from the Developer Portal to move off the Beta. This will once again be a complete clean and restore so make sure your backups are up to date before starting.\nBarring any last minute showstoppers the GM build will be the released version.\n\nA: You can install the iOS 7 final release over the beta without problems. Especially because Apple officially does not support downgrading at all.\nPreviously you had to download the release version as an image from the Apple developer site and install it first though. This might change with iOS 7.\nHere is a similar question and answer for iOS 6:\nHow can I upgrade iOS 6 beta to iOS 6 public release\n", "Q: Upgrading from Windows 8 to 8.1 RTM on a Boot Camp partition Have anyone been able to upgrade/install Windows 8.1 on a Boot Camp partition?\nWhen trying to upgrade to 8.1 RTM it goes into blue screen on first boot, claiming that \"A required device is missing\" and then rolls back the update:\n\nThis is the error message I get after rollback:\n0x101 - 0x20017\n\nUPDATE: When upgrading via the Windows Store, I get this error message after rollback:\n0xC1900101 - 0x20017\n\n\nA: I am very happy to report, that, at least with 2012 15\" Retina Macbook Pros (and I think a good chance with all other relevant Mac models), that there is a method to upgrade Windows 8 to 8.1 (even Enterprise, in my case) without the need for a DVD or USB drive.\nYou simply mount the ISO and run the setup file from the mounted disc, while following the steps I lay out below (and actually, I think that even just extracting the files from your MSDN ISO (or running the update from the Windows Store), would work as well!):\n(Again, I have a 2012 15\" Retina Macbook Pro, currently with OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion), Bootcamp 5.0 (no rEFIt, just simple bootcamp setup), and until 30 minutes ago, Windows 8 x64 Enterprise EN-US.)\n\n\n*\n\n*First preparation step, is to make sure, in both Win 8's Bootcamp Control Panel settings AND Mountain Lion's System Preferences, to set the Windows partition as the default boot drive. I checked thoroughly on both sides and rebooted a couple times to make sure Windows was what it would ALWAYS boot to no matter what I chose (via alt key) the last time.\n\n*To make sure you can do a seamless 'in-place' upgrade, keeping your 'Windows settings, personal files and apps', you need to make sure the 'target language' of your 8.1 ISO is the same as your Windows 8's 'host language', so if you have an EN-GB Windows 8 you should download the EN-GB 8.1 ISO if you want to do a full in-place upgrade instead of a clean or half-way reinstall. (However it may be possible to just change to EN-US from EN-GB by carefully changing ALL system language and regional and keyboard settings to EN-US and deleting all instances of EN-GB temporarily to make it a match - I cannot confirm this though.)\n\n*Simply mount your ISO and run its setup.exe to start the install process. To mount natively in Windows 8, right-click on ISO in Windows Explorer and 'Mount' is at the top of the context menu. If it is not, follow this guide to temporarily make the option visible in Windows Explorer.\n\n*The install process will take you through the upgrade, painlessly through about 5-6 reboots, and each time, because it has been carefully set and checked (on  both sides of Bootcamp) to ALWAYS boot into Windows partition by default, you are secure in Windows properly continuing through the install process every time. (I have installed Windows from extracted ISO folder on C drive before, so even non-mounting may work in this instance as well.)\nDone.\n\nA: If anyone else has issues, I had exactly this blue screen issue, and just managed to get the app store update working using Parallels. The ISO method didn't work for me as my Windows 7 to Windows 8 upgrade key didn't get recognised.\nSo for me, this worked:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Parallels (trial should also do it). \n\n*Load Windows 8 on your bootcamp partition into Parallels. Parallels will do a bunch of stuff to get the bootcamp partition to behave like a VM (you can still login directly into your bootcamp instance).\n\n*While in Parallels, Go to Windows Store and get the Windows update.\n\n*Let the updates complete and let the Parallels instance restart itself.\n\n*During the reboot, Parallels may complain about OS X preventing Windows from messing with the boot partition. Just hit OK, and proceed. It'll also warn you that you may have issues booting into the bootcamp partition without Parallels (doesn't seem to be a problem).\n\n*After the upgrade completes, shutdown the Parallels instance cleanly and reboot your Mac into your bootcamp partition.\n\n*If all goes well, you should see the driver update spinner, and after a while, it should go to the new setup steps.\n\n\nA: I upgraded to win 8.1 from windows store. Boot camp 4 allows 8.1 to run in partition but no longer allows Boot camp to run - thus losing some driver functions. \n\nA: It's an Apple know issue.\nNow with Mac OS X 10.8.5, Boot Camp had an upgrade, so it's compatible with Windows 8.1.\nIf it still not working, try to reinstall Windows 8.1 RTM from the Boot Camp app, or install it booting from Windows 8.1 RTM DVD into Boot Camp partition.\n\nA: Ok I was crazy enough to just try the upgrade within Windows 8.0 on boot camp (updated OS to 10.8.5). Ran from DVD and got option to upgrade and keep settings files and Apps.... apps? applications or only win8 apps??? got little scared but reading it do keep application.\nRan with success! :) now in Win 8.1 it just want me to repair my VPN client, so so far it looks great! it works (for me at least)\n\nA: I successfully upgraded my Windows 8 Boot Camp to 8.1 today via a combination of the marketplace download and 8.1 ISO DVD. I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro with Boot Camp 5 and this was my method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Burn the 8.1 ISO image to DVD.\n\n*Change startup disk to Boot Camp partition in either OS X or via Boot Camp control panel in Windows & reboot into Windows if not already there.\n\n*Insert 8.1 ISO DVD into the superdrive - if you don't have a drive, get hold of an external one (this disk MUST be in drive at the point Windows 8 has downloaded from the marketplace).\n\n*Download and Perform the 8.1 upgrade from the store (it will reboot 3-4 times doing the upgrade, plus you should hear the DVD being accessed post auto reboots).\n\n*Test your newly upgraded Windows, then use the Boot Camp control panel to switch your default boot drive back to OS X.\n\nA: I upgraded my 8.1 without a second thought and no real issues except when i bootup with a thunderbolt display the resolution is off till i restart a few times.  Turns out the 6700 HD AMD graphics card windows 8 driver doesn't play nice with 8.1.  Very annoying but no problems and I am running maverick on late model 2011 MBP 17\" 16gb ram upgrade and 1 TB SSD drive upgrade. Runs beautifully otherwise. I haven't tried gaming since the upgrade to 8.1 so we'll see.\nI had windows 8 already installed through bootcamp when i was on mtn OS lion, pretty sure i upgraded to 8.1 after the mavericks download.\n\nA: You should fix this by installing a fresh efi windows 8.1 install first (no bootcamp assistant !!FRESH!!), and then install bootcamp for drivers after first login. \nIf you want to add new acc, u should uninstall bootcamp software after u got all drivers working like wifi etc.. Or else, you will receive bluescreen AGAIN. \nI am not sure why install windows or add an account with bootcamp cause this error, but just follow my direction and it works.. \n\nA: Solved this by reinstalling Windows 8.1 on the Bootcamp partition and the re-added it to Parallels.\nThe suggestions from @foregon and @Nash were helpful, but unfortunately had no effect on my system.\n", "Q: Where is the latest Microsoft Messenger (or alternative) that works with Exchange?

I downloaded Skype but can't find a way to sign into my Exchange account at work. Is it possible to use Skype with an Exchange account? If not, is there somewhere I can download Microsoft Messenger 8.0 / 2011?\n\nA: Lync for Mac may be what you're looking for. It's a replacement for Office Communicator (the IM, presence, conferencing and voice client). Your work environment should support it with the server though.\n", "Q: How can I wipe an encrypted volume when the password is forgotten? I have encrypted disk volume that is in the way and the passphrase is gone.\nHow can I erase the contents and reuse the disk space?\n\nA: To delete encrypted volume disk (not your main boot disk)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app\n\n*Unmount disk using\ndiskutil unmountDisk force /Volumes/disk2 (substitute /Volumes/disk2 with your disk)\n\n*Find disk UUID\ndiskutil coreStorage list\n\n*Delete disk/volume\ndiskutil coreStorage delete [UUID] (substitute [UUID] with your disk's UUID obtained from the previous command)\n", "Q: Breadboard Software? I am learning how to do some beginner work with electronics, so I am looking for a breadboard.

Since it is only used for backup purposes, it is sleeping most of the time. \nHowever if I now want to save something (e.g. a picture from a website) to my internal hard disk, I have to wait for the external one to wake up before the \"save as...\" dialogue appears. \nI know about the question How to save a file quickly and no need to wait for the external hard drives to \"wake up\"?, but it sounds like it intends a solution about not letting the hard disks go to sleep whereas I would like to let the external hard drive have its well-deserved rest.  \n\nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not want to unplug it, because I know that I will forget to reconnect it before the automatic backup\n\n*various other operating systems deal very well with situations like that\n\n\n\nEDIT2:\nUsing Sherwood Botsford's answer I put together the following AppleScript which mounts the hard drive, executes for example an rsync and unmounts it again.\ndo shell script \"diskutil mount 'Name of your Volumn'\"\n\ndo shell script \"rsync -av --delete ~/ '/Volumes/Name of your Volume/.'\"\n\ndo shell script \"diskutil unmountDisk 'Name of your Volume'\"\n\n\nA: possibilities.\nA: Unmount the disk from the command line.  \ndiskutil unmountDisk Lacie\n\nwould be the command to unmount a disk that has a file system named Lacie on it. \nYou can also refer to the device itself, but devices can vary from one mount to another.  unmountDisk will take any file system name as the object but will unmount all other file systems if the drive has more than one.\nThen, when you want to do a backup, \n diskutil mount Lacie\n\nYou also need to disable spotlight from indexing this drive.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion Screen Freeze My Mountain Lion is keeps freezing from few weeks, today it freezes/crashed couple of times already.\nHere is the log before the big freeze (file /var/log/system.log):\nSIMBL Enabler for Sandboxed Apps[3334]: Will terminate until reinvoked again by launchd.\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.pbs[3243]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3243 [pbs]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.iCloudHelper[3241]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3241 [com.apple.iCloud]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.xpcd.F5010000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000[3238]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3238 [xpcd]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3237]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3237 [SleepServicesD]\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.CalendarAgent[3188]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3188 [CalendarAgent]\nkernel[0]: (default pager): [KERNEL]: ps_select_segment - send HI_WAT_ALERT\nkernel[0]: macx_swapon SUCCESS\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3362]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3362 [SleepServicesD]\nSubmitDiagInfo[3240]: Launched to submit Diagnostics and Usage\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.daemon[3235]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3235 [cfprefsd]\nWindowServer[222]: reenable_update_for_connection: UI updates were finally reenabled by application \"Activity Monitor\" after 125.95 seconds (server forcibly re-enabled them after 1.00 seconds)\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3364]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3364 [SleepServicesD]\ncoreaudiod[249]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active\ncoreaudiod[249]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.pbs[3369]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3369 [pbs]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3368]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3368 [SleepServicesD]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.daemon[3366]): Exited: Killed: 9\ncom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent[3225]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3366 [cfprefsd]\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3225 [cfprefsd]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3387]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3387 [SleepServicesD]\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.locationd[3191]): Exited with code: 1\ncom.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3388]): Exited: Killed: 9\nkernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3388 [SleepServicesD]\nlocationd[3405]: Incorrect NSStringEncoding value 0x8000100 detected.

Running it shows all displays:\n$ cscreen\nDisplayID  Index     Depth     Width     Height  Refresh\n 4249fef       1        32      2560       1440     0\n 4248344       2        32      2560       1440     0\nuse -h to display all usage options\n\nSure enough, you can force one of them to be primary (with menu bar):\n$ cscreen -i 4248344 -p\n\nYou can script setting the second screen as the primary like this:\n$ cscreen -l | perl -lane 'print $F[0] if $F[1] == 2' | xargs -I id cscreen -i id -p\n\nNow, to bind to a key, I first created an AppleScript script, SwapScreen.scpt:\n\nThen I used QuickSilver to bind the script to a F13:\n\nNow, when I plug in my MacBook, if the screens are messed up, I simply hit F13. Sweet!\n\nA: Been there, done that, with Mac Pro and 4 monitors. ;0\nThere is an odd bug/feature in OSX that makes default display settings privileged.  This behavior has not changed with 10.9 and I believe is what is causing your problem.  It is very poorly-documented and discussed on the web.  \nA permanent solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log on as the root user (you will have to temporarily enable it). \n\n*Set the Display arrangement to what you want (as you show above)\n\n*Log back on as whatever you like\nIt is somewhat non-obvious how to enable the Root User for interactive login, though not hard.  Here is the official Apple guide:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH113311\nI would disable it when done for security reasons.  \n\nA: It should remember the external setttings.\nDid you try to swap the cables behind the monitor in order to invert the connection order? Maybe could do the trick.\nA very easy solution is waiting one months and upgrade to OS X Mavericks, where you will have the possibility of having the menu bar and dock on both screen\n\nA: The tool I wrote, displayplacer, allows you to configure the \"white bar\" main display via scripts/hotkeys.\nConfigure your screens how you like, drag the \"white bar\" to your primary screen in the macOS system settings, and then execute displayplacer list. It will output the command to run to put your screens in their current configuration. The screen with origin:(0,0) is the main display with the \"white bar\". Run this terminal command through a script, Automator, BetterTouchTool, etc.\nExample profile 1 puts the white bar on the menu bar on the left monitor.\ndisplayplacer \"id:<leftScreenId> res:1920x1080 scaling:on origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \"id:<rightScreenId> res:1920x1080 scaling:on origin:(1920,0) degree:0\"\nExample profile 1 puts the white bar on the menu bar on the right monitor.\ndisplayplacer \"id:<leftScreenId> res:1920x1080 scaling:on origin:(1920,0) degree:0\" \"id:<rightScreenId> res:1920x1080 scaling:on origin:(0,0) degree:0\"\nAlso available via Homebrew brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer\n\nA: cscreen doesn't work properly when you have more than 2 monitors, and even if it did, switching primary monitors with it will mess up the positions of your desktop icons. \nThe best solution I know is a utility called SwitchResX (http://www.madrau.com/). It has a feature called Display Sets that effectively remembers everything about a particular display setup (including resolution, orientation, and which screen is primary). You can then switch to a specific Set from the menu bar or with a shortcut. It remembers the positions of your desktop icons when you switch to a different Set, and puts them back when you restore. \nWorks like a charm, and there's no need for AppleScript. SwitchResX is also great at its primary function: easily changing screen resolution, even to resolutions not normally available in System Preferences. It's essential if you do a lot of presenting and have to switch res to whatever projector setup you're stuck with.\n", "Q: Updating iphone 4s OS 5.1.1 to ANYTHING more current 6.1.1? 7.0? I have not updated my iphone 4s since the day I got it. I am still on IOS 5.1.1. I jailbroke the phone when i first got it, but the jailbreak was outdated and stopped working so I deleted it off the iphone. If i want to update my IOS can I just backup my files and hit update on my phone or itunes to a more updated IOS ? I do not wish to jailbreak my phone afterwards, I dont need it. My concern was in the past i heard that if you updated your OS with a jailbroken phone, the phone goes into a loop on the restart. I had this happen to my on my iphone 3G. Any thoughts?\n\nA: \ncan I just backup my files and hit update on my phone \n\nYes.\n\nPressing the Update button will cause a jailbroken iPhone to 'go wrong', usually resulting in a reboot loop. Pressing Update on a non-jailbroken iPhone is fine, even if it was previously jailbroken.\nTo update a jailbroken device, removing the jailbreak…\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup the device using either iTunes or iCloud.\n\n*Restore the device. You can use a previously-downloaded IPSW, or let iTunes download the latest one for you.\n\n*Restore from backup. When setting up your iPhone, choose to restore from backup and let iTunes/iCloud restore the backup.\n", "Q: What features of iOS 7 are available to iPhone 4S users? What features from iOS 7 are available on the iPhone 4S? Is it any more sluggish that iOS 6?\n\nA: TUAW posted this breakdown of new features and the devices upon which they will work when iOS 7 was announced:\n\nPanorama -- The photo feature Apple introduced last year will be\n  available on the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, and fifth-gen iPod touch. iPad\n  users are out of luck here.\nSquare/Video formats and swipe to capture -- These features will be\n  available on the iPhone 4 and above, the third-generation iPad and\n  above, the iPad mini and the fifth-generation iPod touch.\nFilters in Camera - This Instagram-inspired feature will only be\n  available for the iPhone 5 and the fifth-generation iPod touch.\nFilters in Photos - This will be available on the iPhone 4 and above,\n  the third-generation iPad and above, the iPad mini and the\n  fifth-generation iPod touch.\nAirDrop - AirDrop in iOS 7 will only work on the iPhone 5, the\n  fourth-generation iPad, the iPad mini and the iPod touch.\nSiri - Siri in iOS 7 has new voices, a new interface and a whole lot\n  more functionality.

Does anyone know what could be causing it? \n\nThe operation couldn’t be completed. (NSURLErrorDomain error -1102.)\n\n\nA: It's due to the overload on Apple's side relating to the launch of iOS 7 a few hours ago. \nThat part of the download infrastructure should scale up over time well - try again every 30 minutes or so. \n\nA: try now, it's working....it was overloaded i guess.\n", "Q: How do I change the brightness in iOS 7?

In the iOS 7 Control Center, there's an \"AirDrop\" option which gives me options to make myself \"discoverable\" to either contacts or everyone.\n\nOn OS X there is a feature called AirDrop that lets you share files between computers. How is this related? What can I share, and how? Does it require Bluetooth or Wi-Fi?\n\nA:  AirDrop\nAirDrop for iOS is similar to the OS X counterpart. It allows you to share files over WiFi1 to nearby devices, such as photos, contacts or Passbook passes/tickets.\nThe 'Contacts Only' setting requires that you be logged in to your iCloud account, and you must have the sending device's Apple ID in your contacts.\nThe receiving device must accept a share, similar to OS X. A popup notification will appear when someone attempts to send you something.\n1 (however Bluetooth must be powered for the initial connection to begin -  the device sends files through WiFi, however the secure connection handshake is achieved through Bluetooth)\n\n\nSending a photo or a document to someone via text or email is fine. But if that someone is right next to you, a text or an email suddenly feels like too many steps. Enter AirDrop for iOS. It lets you quickly and easily share photos, videos, contacts — and anything else from any app with a Share button. Just tap Share, then select the person you want to share with. AirDrop does the rest using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. No setup required. And transfers are encrypted, so what you share is highly secure.\n\n", "Q: Transfer rate between Hard Drives I am on a 2012 Mac Pro. I just asked it to copy my iTunes music folder which happens to be 40GB. Now, SATA shows a 3Gb speed, so ~320Gb of data should take all of 110 seconds. I know 3Gb is the high end for the SATA itself, and the drives are much lower. So instead of 2 minutes, even 20 makes sense. \nI'm looking at 26 hours? Any ideas what can cause this? Fortunately, the need to back up this amount of data is rare. Just wondering what's up. \n\n\nA: I would open up activity monitor and see what the effective instantaneous (and recent) transfer rate for data and more importantly iops.\nOften many small files tax the total amount of IO operations and it's not a bandwidth issue at all. Large files that are stored sequentially on the filesystem (or when the platters and heads can not delay the transfer) will typically hit between 30 and 80 MB/s on a Mac Pro that's otherwise idle.\nSimilarly, more than 1,000 iops would saturate most pairs of SATA drives and perhaps far fewer IO could be limiting depending on catalog and file fragmentation or just long head seek times.\n", "Q: Restored from iOS 7 BETA to iOS 6.1.3 and can't activate phone Okay so first off, I have an iPhone 4 CDMA (Verizon), but haven't had cell service on it for two years. Not that that matters but thought I'd throw it in there, that it only works with wifi.\nNow that that's out of the way, about a month ago I downloaded iOS 7 Beta 5 without a dev account (I know, but I couldn't help it). I had the same problem that I've seen other question here on, where people couldn't restore to iOS 6.1.3 in order to get the public release of iOS 7. So, I went to ipswdownloader and downloaded iOS 6.1.3 (CDMA), backed up my iPhone, and then restored it with the 6.1.3 software/firmware. My iPhone then restarted, and took me through the process of setting up a new iPhone. But, unlike anything I've seen before, it's asking to activate it as if it is brand new and under devices in iTunes, my iPhone's name is not there, it just says 'iPhone'. I figured I could just set it up and then restore backup but when I try to activate it through iTunes (because it can't find a server if I try from the phone) I get this error message:\n\n\nWe could not complete your iTunes store request.\nThe network connection was lost.\nThere was an error in the iTunes store. Please try again later.\n\n\nI thought maybe because everyone in the world (literally) is downloading iOS 7 and maybe apple's servers were overflowing but I can connect to the iTunes store from iTunes, just not with my phone. The other thing is, even though I cancelled service on this phone almost 2 years ago, it still said Verizon as my service provider, now it says 'No Service'. \nObviously my phone completely reset. Please tell me there is something I can do to activate it and get all my apps, photos, etc back on it\n\nA: The activation servers were overwhelmed presumably by the volume of activity on launch day. Now activation fails for a different reason - Apple is no longer signing iOS 6 software during the restore process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Where can I find information about past versions of iOS and code-signing windows?\nOnce you get your OS activated either through iTunes or over the air, you will be able to load your backup as you had planned.\nApple would surely make it easier on a segment of its customer base if the service status page were kept updated thusly….\n\n", "Q: How do I stop OS X from treating a SuperDuper image on an external drive as part of my current installation? Every night, I have SuperDuper! create an image of my hard drive to an external drive. This works great, and has saved me from system failures a number of times.\nHowever, OS X is constantly treating it as if the installation of OS X on that external drive is a part of my actual system rather than just a backup on an external drive. To wit, when I do a Spotlight search all results are duplicated. (Even though I have expressly forbidden Spotlight's indexing of the /Volumes folder through System Preferences.) Every app in the Mac App Store, when updated, will update the copy on my system and then report again a second time that this app needs to be updated again, and running the update will update this external drive. Apps that request the location of my iPhoto library always list two. \nHow can I get OS X to just treat that drive like an external drive full of data, rather than as a part of the current OS X installation?\n\nA: Most people I know that keep bootable backups do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do these backups far less often and use Time Machine to keep the most up to date backup.\n\n*Script mounting and ejecting the drive as part of the copy process.\n\n\nThe first option works well for a monthly rotation (and just before major updates like an OS update or upgrade) since the bootable image is more about getting running rapidly than needing to have a perfect mirror of everything when your actual data is backed up elsewhere. \nThe second option I have seen for people that really despise Time Machine since you will get all sorts of unwanted confusion having two (or more) OS mounted at the same time with Spotlight, App Store Updates and worse mixing up which file should be opened or updated.\nAssuming you have already told SuperDuper to not make a fresh copy and instead perform a smart update, you might be in the same boat as these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do apps which are not installed run from an external bootable drive?\n\n*How do I make Spotlight stop indexing my Backup drive?\n\n*Stop Spotlight from indexing a drive that is regularly unplugged and reattached\nThe last topic about indexing may also help you if you script the mounting and unmounting as spotlight may want to reindex the drive each time depending on precisely how you have SuperDuper set up.\n", "Q: Can iOS 7 folders and dock be skinned to be totally black? I've just upgraded to iOS 7 on an iPhone 4S. I prefer a completely black wallpaper, but I noticed that making it so will turn the backgrounds of folders and the dock grey.\n\nI am looking for a combined wallpaper color and folder/dock background to make them as close as possible to all black. If someone has a jailbreak solution, that's great, but that won't work for me as I prefer not to change the OS in that way.\nAre there solutions to achieve this visual effect?\n\nA: As far as I know, there is really no way to do what you are asking. Both the dock and the folder backgrounds are a result of the \"frosted glass\" effect that Apple has introduced with iOS 7. No matter what color background you are using, the dock and folder backgrounds are going to lighten and blur whatever is behind them to achieve that effect.\n\nA: Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast: ON goes some way to reduce the transparency effects, particularly in Control Center, but the grey boxes you refer to are essentially an average of your background wallpaper.  Switch to a largley blue one, and they will use a colour averaged blue with added transparency for them.  There's no supported way to set an arbitrary colour.\n\nA: I kept having this issue where mine was gray. I went into Settings (Settings->-General->Accessibility) and found that high contrast was on. I switched it off and the dock became more transparent. It's not going to be entirely black, I'm sure.\n\nA: You can go into General > Accessibility > Invert Colours - However it makes all your icons look awful, but the backgrounds on texts, options, settings etc.. all look fantastic!\nI agree it would be better to be able to switch this to a black background skin, than white, I don't really like the white look, but maybe it's just something I'm not used to just yet.\n\nA: I took a picture of a black piece of glossy paper and then used that photo as my wallpaper. Makes it look good as I have a Black iPhone 5\n", "Q: No shared Links available in iOS 7 Safari New with iOS 7 is a \"Shared Links\" tab in Safari.

Just this message:\n\nNo Shared Links\nLinks shared by your contacts from select social networks will appear\nhere.\n\nHow do I link my twitter account in Safari so that content appears here?\n\nA: Go to Settings > Twitter and link your account there. Once installed, and linked, if you open the Bookmarks tab in Safari, you will see Bookmarks, the Reading List, and Shared Links. If you have logged in properly, your Shared Links will appear here.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem; the update wiped out many passwords, and this is what's causing minor problems.\nTo get Twitter to work on Safari 7, go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts > [your Twitter account]. The account should be there as one of your accounts, and your password is likely gone - just retype it and save.

I believe currently, the only fix is to restore and restore backup. I haven't seen a way of getting back that token without doing a restore.\n\nA: I seen different people saying that you have to back up, factory restore the phone, then restore your backup onto the phone and it'll work.. \nIt's so much work but if it works then it'll be worth it \n", "Q: Keyboard extremely sluggish on iOS7 with iPhone 4s I've upgraded to iOS7 on my iPhone 4s.  The keyboard, regardless of what I am doing, either texting or entering email, is extremely sluggish - 5 second interval between keystrokes.\nWhat are some ways to troubleshoot this problem?\n\nA: Try Settings > General > Reset all settings.  I was having the same problem and that fixed it on my 4s.\n\nA: Try turning off \"Documents and Data\" in iCloud.  It should make typing faster.  You can turn it back on, but if you go to iCloud Storage and Data, it will start lagging again.  You then must turn off \"Documents and Data\" once more.\nThis info was in the comments of this review:  http://www.gottabemobile.com/2013/09/18/ios-7-iphone-4s-first-impressions-performance/\n\nA: I am going to attempt this on my iPad 3 and my iPhone 4 since they both are clearly slower at responding to keyboard input on iOS 7 than they were on iOS 6. I half expected the iPhone 4 to my laggy the first few days and it it. I wasn't prepared for the iPad to stutter so much.\nHere is what I've learned:\nMy backup that I loaded was slowing the device down a little, but much of the slowness persists when I erase all content and settings.\nThis happens on both the iPhone 4 and iPad 3. It's not horrible once the OS is done getting all the pop up messages, apps updated and things generally settle down. For the first few hours, my typing was definitely getting truncated. Passwords I've typed hundreds of times (and thus quite quick) would miss letters and be rejected initially. \nAfter a night of charging and all the apps updated, the iPad has all the apps from an iCloud restore and all the settings intact. The iPhone 4 erased all content and settings and have only enabled a few things like iTunes Match, podcasts and mail accounts (iCloud x2, Office 365 x2, IMAP) and the usual Messages, FaceTime, and core apps that ship with iOS.\nI plan to see if iBooks and the rest of things slow down the iPhone 4 too much for me and make a call next week to sell it / keep it at iOS 6 or tough it out on iOS 7 in hopes that some or all of the \"slowness\" gets tuned away.\nI do expect Apple to get a lot of real world metrics from bar appointments, troubleshooting logs and misbehaving app crashes to get things tuned up better - but that doesn't help me today. Sometimes, but not all the time, the keyboard is lagging half a beat or more when it did not used to nearly as often.\n", "Q: What is iTunes Radio's skip limit? Pandora, Spotify Radio, and other music/radio streaming services usually have a limit on the number of skips allowed in a set amount of time. Does iTunes Radio have a similar limit, and if so, what are its conditions?\n\nA: It's 6 song skips per hour for each station.\nI also have iTunes Match turned on and I'm still limited to 6 skips.\n\nA: I have observed a skip limit being enforced - after 5 rapid skips on some of the canned stations, one is left. This matches Apple's list of common questions that states 6 skips per channel in an hour is the current limit. \n\nAlso, the skip control seems to be disabled for some narrated tracks like the Guest DJ when the artist is speaking.

I just plugged my iPhone into my new mac (previously it was managed using itunes on a PC)\nI just want to delete some songs that are on the iPhone.\nIt seems I can't press delete on the songs in iTunes when the phone is connected.\nWhen I select Manually manage my songs and videos it prompts \"the iphone is synced with another itunes library. Do you want to erase this iPhone and sync with this iTunes library?\"\nI don't understand because it was manually managed on my PC not synced to a library. Also the prompt isn't very helpful, what does \"erase this iPhone\" mean? Delete everything? Just music and videos?\nIf I check \"Manually manage my songs and videos\" and receive the prompt which says it will \"erase this iPhone\" what will it actually erase? Is it just the songs and videos?\n\nA: In my case I plugged my iPhone into the new iTunes then clicked 'sync' for the music only and it deleted all the music that was on my iPhone and replaced it with all the music that was in iTunes.\nThis seemed to work fine and DID NOT delete my contacts, texts, emails, apps, etc., etc. Although in my case I sync those things to iCloud so I cannot speak for iPhones that are not synced to iCloud. Maybe iTunes will delete this stuff, although based on the fact it did not delete my photos and etc. I would say this is unlikely.\nI know it's not a full answer, but I am confident if you sync the music only the message “Do you want to erase this iPhone and sync with this iTunes library” will only apply to the music on the device. Just make certain you have not clicked 'sync' on any other tab such as contacts.\n\nA: It will only erase the media items synched with the previous library.\nI just tested this on iOS 8—it absolutely does not affect anything else (settings, etc.) on the phone. It took two seconds and my iPhone 6 didn't even flash its screen.\n\nA: The first part of the sync error message means exactly what it says - your iPhone can only be associated with a single iTunes library.  The second half is tricky for people that are analytical, but for most users it's meant to make them want to back up their phone before they erase it.\nRegardless of how you choose to copy your content (sync manually or automatic) it maintains a connection to a single library to which is is allowed to copy music/films/apps etc to and from, and where backups/restores etc can be made. Unless you know exactly what was synced - you could be inadvertently erasing some content hence the scary general error message.\nIf you introduce your iPhone to a new iTunes library, then it can remove any content that is associated with the previous one.  Assuming you still have access to the old one you can copy the files from one computer to another to enable you to sync them back again after, or you can transfer the purchases to the new iTunes library assuming it has been authorised using the same Apple ID.  This is an attempt to limit unauthorised copying of music and other content etc, otherwise you could happily take your phone or iPod around to all your friends laptops and merrily copy all their stuff onto your device, where you could then happily sync it back to your iTunes library at home.\nOther phone content, like emails, contacts, settings should remain unaffected, as these are not held within the iTunes library (even if you have set iTunes to be the sync mechanism for putting them on your phone, they belong outside of the library.\nRule of thumb: if the original iTunes copied the content on in the first place, it will be removed.  It won't just wipe the whole phone, just what came from iTunes.\n\nA: The message is wrongly worded — it doesn't erase the entire iPhone, but only content synced from another library which is now being replaced.\nLet's say that you had synced music, photos, apps and ebooks from iTunes on machine 1. Now you try to sync music from iTunes on machine 2. It deletes only the music on the iPhone, and then syncs the music over. It does not touch the other content types (photos, apps, etc) because you are not syncing those.\nThis is the behavior in iOS 6 -- I don't know about 7.\n", "Q: Original Parallax Backgrounds for iOS7 It appears that Apple left out of the final version the original parallax backgrounds that were on the original beta. Does anyone know where to locate those old files? \nNOTE: I've been able to find some low-res wallpapers in backups (the file is named LockBackgroundThumbnail.jpg), but the actual wallpaper doesn't seem to exist elsewhere.\nThe example background I used on the beta version is this one:\n\nI'd like to obtain all of the original backgrounds that seem to have been removed from the final release.\n\nA: There is no appropriate manner in which to get these files AFAIK.

It was apparently installed from an image because there are a lot of installed apps and, though there is no extra data on the machine, I see various printers, accounts, network shares and the like when I open configuration dialogs. The seller also put a restore image on one of the HDs.\nI have had a number of problems booting into various modes.\nFirst off, I cannot boot into the Apple Hardware Test, either using D or Option-D. There is no .diagnostics folder in /System/Library/CoreServices. I have nothing but keyboard (PC, not Apple), mouse, monitor, and  Ethernet cable attached directly to appropriate ports. No USB hub. It is common for Lion not to have the AHT on the HD but internet access to it should work but doesn’t.\nI can’t boot into some of the optional modes.\nBoot options that do work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safe Boot (Shift) - takes a long time and Verify Disk hangs system\n\n*Start from bootable media (C)\n\n*Reset NVRAM (Command-Option-P-R)\n\n*Eject removable discs (F12 key)\n\n\nBoot options that don’t work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Single User mode (Command-S)\n\n*Apple Hardware Test (D, Option-D)\n\n*Startup Manager (Option)\n\n*Recovery System (Command-R)\n\n*Open Firmware (Command-Option-O-F)\n\n\nI know it is necessary to wait until the boot chime sounds before depressing the option keys, but I don’t hear the chime unless I reset NVRAM. When I do, I get the chime on the next hard boot but it disappears upon subsequent boots. So that is a problem. But I have tried resetting NVRAM, logging in, powering down, and doing a hard re-boot, and holding down the keys after the chime. In all the cases that don’t work, the system never boots and I have to do a force power-off.\nI suspect this is probably a firmware problem but I’m not sure and could find little information about this problem.\nI checked the firmware version and it is up-to-date.\nsystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep -i \"Version\" | awk -F ':' '{print $1 $2}'\n\n  Boot ROM Version MP51.007F.B03\n  SMC Version (system) 1.39f11\n  SMC Version (processor tray) 1.39f11\n\nI tried to re-install the latest version for this model, Mac Pro EFI Firmware Update 1.5  - Mac Pro (Mid 2010) MacPro5,1 MP51.007F.B03 (EFI 1.5) (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1321) but  it won’t install:\nAlert\nThis software is not supported on your system.\n\nEven though it already exists on my system.\nI tried installing it from the Firmware Restoration CD 1.9 (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1320) but I can’t get it to work.

My DVD drive doesn't work, so I tried making a bootable usb hard drive and then a bootable usb flash drive from my Snow Leopard Installation DVD, and couldn't get the iMac to see either of them, I thought, when actually the problem was the iMac wasn't seeing the startup key sequences from the Bluetooth keyboard. Something so simple...\n\nA: \nSafe Boot (Shift) - takes a long time and Verify Disk hangs system\n\nIf you mean that safe boot does not complete – if you mean that the disk verification stage of safe boot is truly endless: \n\n\n*\n\n*whilst limited to Lion, you'll probably not find a workaround or solution for that bug. \n\n\nPlease see: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/105078/8546\n\n\nOpen Firmware (Command-Option-O-F)\n\nThat's probably not applicable to an Intel Mac.\n\n\nkeyboard (PC, not Apple)\n\nWhat make and model? \nIs it wireless? Please be aware that there's a known issue with at least one Apple keyboard that uses Bluetooth. \n\nA: It's extremely strange that you were not getting EFI boot options to work from a wired keyboard.\nI note that the EFI startup commands you listed that worked used either the Shift key modifier or the Option AND Cmd modifier.  The commands that didn't work used either Option OR Cmd.  Makes you wonder...\nYou do know that the keys that generate \"Option\" and \"Cmd\" keycodes are typically reversed from a PC to a Mac keyboard, correct?  (It's easy to forget if you normally have them remapped in System Preferences->Keyboard.) Is it possible you were using the wrong modifier keys at startup time?\nAlso very strange that the nvram dump shows your desktop machine had been assigned a name that implied it was previously a laptop.  If the previous owner used some sort of imaging tool to initialize your machine but took the image from a different model of Mac I can imagine all sorts of strange things could be going wrong.\n", "Q: Deleting more than one song at one time on my iPhone? I need help finding a way to delete more than one song at a time on my iPhone. Can someone tell me if that is possible?\nI have tried deleting songs on my iTunes and then syncing them but it does not work and it takes way too much time.\n\nA: You can do it by deleting albums, artists or compilations from the respective views. Swipe right on the item to get the Delete button and tap it to delete an entire album, an entire artist's works or an entire compilation. This still works only one (album or artist or compilation) at a time. There is no way to select multiple albums or artists or compilations for deletion.\n\nA: you cant delete albums or artists on the i phone. you just have to delete songs 1 by 1\n", "Q: Hard drive enclosure for 2.5\" Sata drive I am not an Apple user myself, but trying to solve a problem for a family member.\nHis Macbook Pro is damaged and not economical to repair, however he would like the data off the hard drive.\nDo I need to find a specific type of external hard drive enclosure, or will any standard 2.5\" SATA enclosure work?\nThank you!\n\nA: MacBooks and other Apple computers that use 2.5\" or 3.5\" form factor drives are all standard SATA II or III, so any typical hard drive would work.\n", "Q: Can SteerMouse sensitivity be automated? I have to adjust the cursor sensitivity in SteerMouse every time I switch between my home mouse and my work mouse. Is there a way to do this programmatically?\n\n\nA: You should check if SteerMouse supports applescript by opening applescript editor and then clicking File -> Open Dictionary. If it does, please reply back.\nIn the meantime, there is a indirect solution, which is to have two separate preferences files for work and home and switching between them.\nFirst, set your home settings. You'll find the preferences file at ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs. Copy that and rename the copy to SteerMouse_home.prefs. Then adjust them for work and copy those preferences and name them SteerMouse_work.prefs. \nThen, in applescript editor, copy this code and save it as an application.\nproperty myLocation : \"\"\n\nif myLocation is \"\" then\n    set myLocation to \"Home\"\nend if\n\nif myLocation is \"Home\" then\n    do shell script \"mv -f ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse_home.prefs ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs\"\n    set myLocation to \"Work\"\n\nelse if myLocation is \"Work\" then\n    do shell script \"mv -f ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse_work.prefs ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs\"\n    set myLocation to \"Home\"\nend if\n\n#You'll only need this part if the app needs to be restarted for the changes to occur.\ntell application \"SteerMouse\"\n    quit\n    activate\nend tell\n\n\nA: While @frediemathews answered the question, I wanted to post the code I ended up using.\nSteerMouse saves its preferences instantly, so I adjusted the settings three times and copied the preference file each time. I have three AppleScripts which contain code like this:\ntell application \"SteerMouse Manager\" to quit\n\ndo shell script \"cp ~/Misc/steermouse-prefs/fast ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs\"\n\ntell application \"SteerMouse Manager\" to activate\n\n(SteerMouse Manager is an application which is hidden inside SteerMouse.app)\n", "Q: Rename home directory without causing double Time Machine backup I want to rename the my home directory (/Users/thisone), using this technique.\nHowever, I just started using Time Machine, and with 200 GB of data in my home directory; what will happen?\nWill the entire 200 GB have to be backed up again, because Time Machine doesn't understand that the data is the same since the home folder name changed?\nIf so, as a panic resort, can I tamper with the Time Machine backup, renaming the home folder there too? (I have only a single backup so far).\nIf so, how do I do this? I seem to remember that even with sudo, OS X objects to any change in the Time Machine folder.\n\nA: I just tried enabling Time Machine on a VM, saving one snapshot, renaming the home directory, and saving another snapshot, and Time Machine did save a second copy of the whole home directory.\nWhen I tried it again but used bypass to rename the home directory on the Time Machine volume before saving another snapshot, Time Machine did not save a second copy of the whole home directory.\nSo try running a command like this after you rename the home directory:\nfor f in /Volumes/*/Backups.backupdb/*/*/*/Users/oldname; do sudo /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Helpers/bypass mv \"$f\" \"${f%/*}/newname\"; done\n", "Q: Remove personal data without doing a full reinstallation I am selling an old Mac with OS X 10.4 (Tiger), and I don't have the installation CD anymore so I can't format and re-install; I have to leave the current installation intact.\nObviously, I'd like to remove any personal data from it.

Anyone else experienced this?\nI currently live in Norway with a Norwegian account, if that matters :)\n\nA: According to zdnet.com (today),\n\niTunes Radio is only available to U.S. account holders at launch and is also available in iOS 7.\n\nThe article is about iTunes 11.1, but I presume the same goes for iOS 7.\nWikipedia (today) states:\n\nCurrently, iTunes Radio is only available in the US.\n\nTechCrunch (yesterday) has:\n\nAlso remember that iTunes Radio is for U.S. iTunes account holders only for now, with no word on when international users will gain access just yet.\n\n\nA: It doesn't matter where you are currently, what matters is that if your account registered as a US iTunes Store or not. I am here in Brasil and I have no problems using the radio here.\n\nA: I encountered the same problem before & here's the solution that I discovered: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the App Store & search for your Apple ID at the bottom of the Featured section.\n\n*Tap your Apple ID & select View Apple ID. \n\n*Choose the Change of Country option, then select US as your country, and fill out the rest.\n\n*Once you are done changing the country, repeat Step 1 & 2 but select Sign Out. \n\n*Lastly, sign in again. Then check your iTunes Radio now in the Music app.\n\n\nA: So when I updated my iPad yesterday I got I tunes radio but the next day it disappered then I read a post saying that if u double click ur home button and swipe all the thing away u will get it .and it works \n\nA: just go to itunes, change your coutry region to us. as simple as that\n\nA: This may seem silly, but it worked for me. Try turning ur phone off and on again. It will be there :)\n", "Q: How do I reorder my songs on an album? I upgraded to ios7 this morning, and now all my albums have their songs out of order.

Every time I type I get strange characters.\nI have tried going into the keyboard preferences and disabling the Option key but that don't seem to be working. I disabled the Alt in the past this way and it worked. When I open the keyboard viewer it's showing the Alt as being pressed down.\nThis is a 2011 Macbook Air. I can't afford a repair at the moment.\n\nA: It seems that because the ALT key was stuck when disabling it, it had no effect. So, I bashed the keys and ran my fingers over them frantically and it unstuck the ALT key. I then went in and disabled it, and all is working fine.\nSometimes we have to go back to caveman tactics to solve these technological problems.

I was so sure I put the correct passcode for it because that is the only passcode I used in my iPhone for years. How can I unlock my iPhone?\n\nA: When you set the passcode, you are required to enter it twice to ensure that you don't make a mistake - if they don't match, you are requested to try again.  If you are unable to use it to unlock your phone now then either you made the same typo twice when setting it, or you are not recalling accurately what you set it to.  Either way, you will need to restore the phone via iTunes to rectify it.\n", "Q: If swipe down on iOS7 gives Notification Centre, where's Spotlight? I just upgraded to iOS 7 on an iPhone 4S. When I swipe down on any screen, I get Notification Center, not Spotlight. Anyone know which setting is wrong? \nMy Google search results are riddled with \"Spotlight does work, you just swipe down!\" articles, so no luck there. Control Center works just fine, if that helps. Disabling Notification Center explicitly on the lock screen also works, such that nothing happens on a swipe down on the lock screen if it's disabled. But Spotlight isn't showing up on a swipe down from regular screens.\n\nA: To get to Spotlight, just swipe down somewhere in the middle of the screen, not from the top (on any home screen, not in an app and not while locked).\n", "Q: Restart airport router via command line Is there any way to restart an apple router via the commandline?  \nProblem: My airport express starts to \"give out\" every day or so. I usually have to unplug it for a couple of seconds and then plug it back in. By \"give out\" I mean it isn't connected to the network and is flashing a yellow light. So, I'm looking for an automatic way to restart the express. I've looked into snmp and it doesn't seem like there's a way to send commands, it's only for stats it seems. \nTo clarify: \nI do not care using Command line, or any other means of remotely resetting the router.\n\nA: It's not possible to access the Airport Express from the command line.\nIf you want to dig into SNMP and are comfortable with Java, you can look at the code for the latest version of the Linux version of Airport Utility on Ubuntu Launchpad.\n\nA: If this is the current AppleTV-styled revision, it should most certainly be under warranty, and the best solution is probably replacing it, not rebooting it.\nIf it's the old 802.11g brick-style model, you'll want to try an earlier firmware unless you absolutely cannot live without multi-speaker AirPlay. The last firmware update for the 802.11g models has an issue with some (generally earlier) units and will crash after some time. Rolling back to firmware 6.1.1 resolves the issue.\n", "Q: Similar to TextExpander App but simulating typewriting text effect I'm looking for an app similar to TextExpander but I need that the expanded snippet to be shown simulating typewriting text effect. \nSomething like shown in this YouTube video.\nIf not posible, can I do it with Automator?\n\nA: If you mean write something in monospace font, I use TextExpander for inserting the clipboard in a specific font, where I choose a monospace font (I chose Monaco since it seems like it's available on many platforms/OS). Handy for when citing a block of code in an email for example.\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by typewriting text effect. If you want to delays before the keystrokes, you might use scripts like this:\ndelay 0.5 -- time to release modifier keys if for example the script is run with command-R\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with c in items of \"example\"\n        keystroke c\n        delay (random number from 0.03 to 0.2)\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIf you want to insert the text in a monospace font, TextExpander supports changing the font if you use rich text snippets.\n\nA: In case you are looking at alternatives to TextExpander too:\nThis is something I spent a while looking at as after TextExpander went to a subscription model I decided to look elsewhere as I really only needed the basic core features, I settled on Dash but there are a number of alternatives, I tried aText but the application appeared to be unsupported at the time.\nI like the site AlternativeTo.net to find alternatives to common products.\n", "Q: How to depict your name on your iPhone's lock screen? Before upgrading to iOS 7 from iOS 6, I had the wallpaper of my iPhone 4S lock screen show my name, address, and email address. Just in case somebody found my phone and was willing to see it returned.\nAfter upgrading to iOS 7, I noticed that any notifications to the lock screen will blur the text to practical invisibility, even if I manoeuvre the text on the wallpaper right in between the top line and the time. (Also, but not relevant to the question, the text placed there moves quite a bit around if you tilt the phone.)\nIn iOS 7, is there a way to leave some details to be easily1 found by the finder of the locked phone? (And I do not mean writing/scratching on the phone or a sticker. I actually came from the earlier sticker-on-the-back solution.)\n1The finder might figure out that you can remove the notification, but, even if aware of the possibility, that might not be the obvious thing to do at all.\n\nA: As you very well explained, the notifications will blur any image. So, the options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not to show any notification on the lock screen\n\n*To depend on the Find my iPhone service from Apple.\n\n\nI personally would not do #1, as I lose features from my phone. I have, however, activated the \"Find my iPhone\" service.\nWith this service, if your phone is lost, you can send messages to it (that will be displayed on the lock screen) and/or you can block the device and let the person only call a specific (alternative) number. This is called the \"Lost Mode\".\nThe only drawback, I see compared to your iOS 6 Wallpaper solution, is that you will have to go to a computer and access the iCloud site to effectively enable one of those features.\nApple has added Activation Lock in iOS 7, that if enabled, even if stolen, your iPhone cannot be deleted or activated with another Apple ID. If the finding person/thief knows this, he will probably return it to you.\n", "Q: What exactly does Background App Refresh in iOS 7 do? I upgraded to iOS 7 yesterday, and I read that iOS 7 allows applications to not only update themselves in the background, but also retrieve current data (like stocks, weather etc.) so they are already up-to-date when I launch them. Nice.\nBut what if I'm not at home in my WLAN, and my data plan is limited? Are data updates still fetched? As far as I know, app updates only happen in WLANs, but what about weather data etc.? The preferences screen says:\n\nAllow apps to refresh their content when on Wi-Fi or cellular, or use Location Services, in the background. Turning off apps may help preserve battery life.\n\nDoes this mean that apps that use location services can also drain my mobile data plan at will? Can I prevent that from happening (i.e. allow location services but prevent background data updates if not in a WLAN)?\n\n\n\nA: The setting to enable or disable Background App Refresh is applicable for both WiFi and cellular. There is no way to disable it only for cellular data. So yes, apps that use location services can drain your cellular data plan.\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restrict which apps are allowed to use background refresh. You can thus limit the amount of data usage by turning on this setting only for the apps that you need background refreshes for.\n\n*Turn off cellular data for specific apps from Settings->Cellular (this page also shows the cellular data used by your apps). This would completely restrict those apps only to WiFi all the time though.\n\n", "Q: iOS7 Moving Backgrounds - file type and creating your own iOS7 comes with parallax backgrounds. \nMy questions are:\nAre these a standard file type? Does anybody know what it is?\nIs there a process to create a custom one?\n--\nEDIT\nThanks everyone - I was asking for both. \nEdit - Someone has suggested that the dynamic backgrounds that are animated according to their programming  are quartz composer files. Is it possible to write one of these yourself and upload it to the phone? What would the process for this be?\n\nA: You are confusing parallax and dynamic.\nParallax is the name given to the effect whereby a still image is moved in response to input at a greater or lesser extent than other on screen elements, to provide a sense of depth. The image used is just a static image file that is slightly larger than the screen size, to allow it to move slightly without introducing blank areas.\nDynamic backgrounds are the animated ones that move according to their programming, not just your input. I suspect they are simply quartz composer files like an OSX screensaver.\n\nA: It looks like Apple doesn't specifically allow you to create dynamic backgrounds - but this developer has a demo of one working. \n\nA: You can use any 'Still' image from your own images or one of your iPhone preset images to be used as a wallpaper. The parallax effect is than applied to that image, so you do not need a special image to get the parallax effect.\nBesides the 'Still' wallpapers, you can also choose a 'Dynamic' wallpaper that iOS 7 provides. You can not use your own 'Dynamic' wallpaper.\nIf you want can turn of the parallex effect in your system settings (it is somewhat hidden).\nSettings -> General -> Accessibility ->  Reduce Motion\n\n(Note that the parallax effect is not available on the iPhone 4.)\n\nA: To make a parallax wallpaper, just use an image 744 x 1392 pixels big.\nIt'll work on iPhone 5+5c+5s. \n", "Q: Difficulty deleting music from music library on my iPhone I'm having difficulty managing music in my iTunes library on my phone. I have old songs that I do not want anymore that are still showing up with the iCloud symbol (ready to download) in my library. Even going to settings to hide certain downloaded music, the songs I do not want still appear (just without the iCloud symbol) and cannot be deleted. I want to completely get rid of some songs. Help.\n\nA: I was having the same problem. I went into Settings on my iPhone and to Music. Towards the bottom it says Show All Music. I just disabled that and it solved my problem.\n\nA: At first, hide all iTunes Music tracks.

Beforehand though, I have done a backup in iTunes before the update.\nSomething I forgot to grab when doing the restore was a voice memo that I somewhat need. And my question is, is there a way to get the voice memo without restoring my iPhone to iOS 6 and restoring from the backup just to get the file?\n\nA: I would do the restore and get the memo (or sync them all to iTunes or another program like PhoneView)\nThat might take 10 seconds of your brain time to get going and some waiting. I've not found a speedy way to dig amongst the backup files to locate specific memos.\nThe backup files are stored plainly in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ but there might be 8,000 files with names friendly to the backup process and not to you and I.\nPerhaps if you knew the size of the file, you could narrow down the audio file or drag a few hundred of the closest sized files into iTunes to see which of them are actual sound / movie files. Scripting the file command to determine which are sound files might narrow the search.\n", "Q: Can I make a dynamic wallpaper?

Is there something wrong with the settings or is it something else?\n\nA: If you accidentially disallowed Skype app accessing your microphone on iOS7 you can change the setting via: Settings -> Privacy -> Microphone -> Skype\n\nA: Ensure Settings > Privacy > Microphone > Skype is turned on.\n\nA: I have a similar problem.  It is not only on Skype, any app requiring microphone access, even if granted, does not work on my iPad 2 after installing iOS 7.  Uninstalling Skype did not help either.\nYou might want to check other apps that use Microphone input to make sure it's not just a Skype issue. It could be hardware failure or an OS issue.\n", "Q: How can I prevent changing of networks? Is there a ways to prevent people from changing wireless networks and other networks?\nDoes Apple have any kind of ACLs or something like Windows where you can control what the users can do?\n\nA: Require Administrator for AirPort\nYou can set up your computer to require an administrator password to change AirPort settings, including changing networks.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences → Network.\n\n\n*Select your WiFi service in the services list.\n\n\n*Click Advanced… in the bottom-right corner.\n\n\n*Select the options that you would like to require administrator authorization for.\n\n\n*Click OK, then Apply.\n", "Q: Changing the default iTunes download directory Is it possible to change the download directory of iTunes on mac?\n\n\n*\n\n*I use mac OSX (10.8.5) and iTunes 11.0.5.\n\n*I want to relocate the directory on a external hard disk storage?\n\n\nA: You can move the Downloads folder in your ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads directory to your external drive, and then create a symlink (symbolic link) to the new Downloads location, and place that symlink in the \n~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Downloads directory.\nHere it is in step form:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit iTunes.\n\n*Go to ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media, and move Downloads to your external drive.

I have an iPhone 4, so making Siri work on it is impossible (you can never find a working port). Is there a Cydia package that can take system commands such as alarm clocks and reminders from Google Now Voice Actions and use them as system commands, like Siri?\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work on iPhone 4 because it does not have Siri but there is a new Jailbreak tweak called googiri which allows Google Now to invoke Siri actions. To use Siri actions inside the Google Now app, You can prefix \"Siri\" keyword before talking. It works well on devices with Siri enabled already.\n", "Q: Is there a log of auto-updated apps? iOS 7 has a new auto-update apps feature.

However, I want to be able to find out what apps have been updated recently, and the App Store app just has a 'all your apps are updated' message on the Update tab.\nIs there a log somewhere that lists recently-updated apps?\n\nA: The App Store should show a list of apps in the Update tab that have been updated, with details such as when it was updated, the changelog and a button to open the app.\n\n\nA: There is a blue dot next to the app name for any app that has been updated, or downloaded, and has not been started since that update/download.  This allows you to keep track of what is updating.

My iPhone, which was updated at the same time, retained my preferred AppleID which is tied to my primary and secondary email addresses—allowing friends to contact me using the addresses they know.\nI was able to log out of my iCloud ID without difficulty but am unable to get the device (or service) to accept the password for AppleID I want to use. Again, this ID is up and running fine on my iPhone.\nMy preferred ID is also tied to my iTunes Store account and purchases from my iPad are working fine—seemingly eliminating \"password\" issues as the source of my difficulty.\nHas anyone experienced this and found a solution? \n\nA: Trying to use an Apple ID with an expired password will result in the inability to authenticate an Apple ID for the messages app and will prevent you from logging into other iCloud services. Unfortunately, the iOS device doesn't notify one that the password has expired. Trying to login into iCloud.com using that ID will also fail without any explanation—it just fails.\nThe iTunes Store seemingly continues to accept the expired password for some period of time after iCloud ceases to do so. (I imagine this is for a limited time only and that the iTunes ID database syncs with the main database regularly.)\nIf you're having problems you can check the status of your Apple ID and change your password by going to Apple's My Apple ID page and logging in. You will be notified if your password has expired and be given the opportunity to change it.\nAn AppleID with a time-expiring password is an outlier situation. I assume this is the reason that iOS/iCloud return incorrect/forgotten password errors instead of notifying the user that the password needs to be changed. \n", "Q: Home screen is moving about in iOS7 I successfully downloaded and activated the new iOS 7, but now my screen won't stop shaking.

Will it be possible to downgrade from iOS 7.0.1 to iOS 6 ? Just in case if i wanted iOS6 back.I'm asking about iOS7 final public version not the beta build.\n\nA: You can downgrade by following the steps here (it's for iOS 7 beta, but will work for the release version too).\nKeep in mind that Apple usually stops signing the older version of iOS shortly after the release of a new version. Until the time Apple continues signing iOS 6, you will be able to downgrade the OS. Nobody can predict when Apple would stop signing iOS 6.\nOnce Apple stops signing iOS 6, it wouldn't be possible to downgrade (unless you look or wait for jailbreaks, hacks and such solutions, which would depend on the iPhone model you have).\n", "Q: I can't find 'Add all tracks' in the add to playlist section in iOS 7 With iOS 7 the \"Add all tracks\" option, when selecting a playlist, seems to have vanished.\nNow the user has to select each song in the playlist individually, which can be very tedious with a long playlist.\nHow can I get back the \"Add all tracks\" option?\n\nA: After contacting a local Apple Store, I was informed that, the feature \"Add all tracks\" used in the playlist has been removed, and now you have to manually add each song or use iTunes to make the Playlist !!\n", "Q: what is the new iOS 7 feature called \"swipe to capture\" On this site Apple praises the new feature \"swipe to capture\"\n\nWith a swipe, you can capture what you want the way you want.

I tried to restore my iPhone from a backup I made about a week ago. iTunes prompted me to install the latest version (11.1) and I went ahead and did this, remembering that I saw somewhere that you need to be running the latest version of iTunes to be able to restore.\nHowever, as soon as it picks up the iPhone in recovery and I press \"Restore\" it forces me to update to iOS 7.  At this point I have pressed \"cancel\", as I'm concerned that if I go ahead and update, I won't be able to restore my phone with last weeks backup, because this  was backed up under iOS 6.\nHow can I restore the phone to iOS 6 and recover my backup?\n\nA: You may be stuck on iOS 7 if you don't have a way to get that software from Apple's servers. Typically only registered developers can download several versions of software, but if you search - there are many places that archive these software ipsw files. It's always a bit of a risk downloading software from a place other than the vendor, but I don't know of a better option.\nTypically, when a new OS is released, iTunes will only download the latest software if you don't already have an older version of the software stored locally. Is there any chance that computer (or another computer) downloaded iOS 6 and still has it on the hard drive? If so, you can decline the offer to upgrade and restore the device from that version of firmware.\nAs was covered in the comments - there is no restriction to load iOS 6 backup on iOS 7. Also - this is more about the computer and iTunes having the old iOS file already downloaded than something that's inherent on the device. Any change you have a backup copy of the iOS files iTunes downloaded?\n\nA: I have a similar answer here. Essentially, you want to hold shift when pressing the Restore button in iTunes, then it will prompt you to locate an IPSW firmware image to restore. You must provide your own IPSW image to do this, though they're not hard to find online. As bmike said, you may also have old IPSW files cached somewhere (use a drive space visualization tool, such as WinDirStat, to locate these, as they're usually several hundred MB in size).\nAs bmike also said, you should be able to restore a backup made on iOS 6 to iOS 7, so that makes the entire problem moot anyways.\n\nA: You can't. Apple does not sign any iOS 6 version for that device anymore. ANY iOS  6 and 7 version before 7.1.1 does have SERIOUS security flaws. So you should upgrade to the latest iOS version no matter what! You can use your backup from iOS 6 to get your data and settings back with ease.\n\nA: I don't know how but, my 4s was 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 was already out. however i had the 7.1.1 firmware and held shift to select it and somehow it allowd me to restore to 7.1.1 without giving me errors to update to 7.1.2.\n", "Q: Alternative way to change volume I have the volume + button broken, and if I click it, it may stuck itself and continuously increase the volume, so I avoid to use the + button.

Can it be done?\n\nA: The folder colors change based upon the background image. So, in that sense, yes, you can. However, they do not have their own UI element to allow you to edit their colors independently.\n\nA: The folder colors, dock, lock screen slide to unlock, as well as the passcode buttons all change based on the background image. That is the only way to change their color, but like Dave mentioned, there is no way to change their colors independently.\n", "Q: Why is iPhone Software Update twice as large in iTunes than on iPhone Downloading iOS 7.0 from iTunes on my Mac was estimated at 1.2 GB (with some 16 hours download time).\nThen I tried downloading it from the iPhone itself, and it said 660 MB (with 8 hours download time).\nHow can the downloadable file be twice as large when coming through iTunes, when they essentially should contain exactly the same data?\n\nA: iTunes does not download the same file as your device does.\nWhen you download the update/upgrade directly to your device, you are downloading a delta update. This means that only the parts of the system which have changed are downloaded, and the rest is left the same. Updates are downloaded this way to reduce the download size.\niTunes could also download a delta update, but doesn't because it saves the downloaded data for later. Instead, it downloads the entire firmware image. There are two reasons to do this. First, you can use your computer to update another device, which could be running a different version of iOS. If it only downloaded a delta update, then it would need to perform a second download for the other version, since there may be different parts of the system which have changed. With the entire firmware, it already has everything it needs (provided that the two devices are the same model, so they use the same firmware). Secondly, you can use iTunes to restore a device which is not working. During a restore, the entire image must be written, since it is not known what parts need to be replaced, so a delta update could not be used.\n", "Q: iOS 7: Disable message \"This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone\"? After the upgrade to iOS 7, while using non-Apple certified chargers I receive the warning \n\nThis cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.\n\nAFAIK there is no way to say \"Got It\", \"Suppress Message\", etc., and it shows up every time I plug in my chargers. \nAnyone know of any ways to disable these messages without jailbreaking the iPhone?\n\nA: The expected behavior when you see this message is to simply contact the vendor of the cable or charger and verify that your are in fact safe to charge an iPhone.\nI would hate to tell people to disregard a message that could have safety implications. Granted, not all third party cables and/or chargers are faulty, but what if this were a warning that could get you to seek assistance from Apple or the vendor and ensure that a sub-standard part isn't being used to charge your device.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/usbadapter-takeback/\nGiven some of the horribly unsafe chargers that I have personally seen, I don't expect this to be an easy warning to bypass without jailbreaking.\n", "Q: How to Log In to Flickr in iOS 7 with a Google Account iOS 7 now looks to include integration with Flickr for photo sharing. \nI already have a Flickr account, though I log in using a google (gmail) account. I would expect to be able to connect this account with iOS 7 Flickr integration, but logging in with this method seems to be unavailable, and using a user@yahoo.com account seems to be the only option.\nHow can a Google account be connected to the iOS 7 Flickr integration (in the settings menu) without having to \"start fresh\" and re-upload photos and content?\n\nA: The work-around solution I've found for this does not require \"starting fresh\", though it does involve some degree of \"new\" account creation. You must create a new user@yahoo.com email address linked to your existing account using the method below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit yahoo.com\n\n*Click the \"Sign In\" option at the top right\n\n*Choose the \"Google\" option to sign in with a Google account\n\n*In the pop-up window that follows, log in with your Google/Gmail account\n\n*Click on \"Mail\" in the top right\n\n*Follow the prompts to create a new yahoo account, using a new/available user@yahoo.com email address\n\n*Once this process is complete (was a bit \"buggy\" for me when creating, asking for password re-prompts then giving errors, but still did actually work), you should be able to use the username (e.g. the \"MyUserName\" from MyUserName@yahoo.com) and password you chose to log in to Flickr; I recommend visiting flickr.com and using these yahoo credentials to ensure your content is present as expected\n\n*If all of the above was successful, you should be able to connect iOS 7 to Flickr via Settings > Flickr by logging in with your yahoo ID and password\n\n\nA: After having experienced the same issue (not being able to login to the Flickr app via iOS7 using my Google/Gmail account) I found that it is required to create a Yahoo account as mentioned. \nOnce I completed that, I was then provided with the additional sign-in options when launching the Flickr app (enabling me to sign-in using my Google account as desired all along). \nI now have a Yahoo account I don't require for anything though (other than to support my use of the Flickr app with Google account sign-in). \n\nA: Here's a better solution. Using Flickr app, attempt to login using false credentials. Basically make up a user name and password and try and login.

Currently this bug is unassigned, so it may take a while to have a fix.\nThe \"Trust the currently connected computer\" warning was developed by Apple to alert users of bogus USB chargers that could compromise the device.\n\nA: the trust system is only stored if you have itunes installed and configured on the host system.  which Sucks.\nso if you want to charge off of your work PC that doesnt have itunes, you are going to get prompted every time you try to plug it in.\nI wish apple would've just smartened up and given us the 'you must unlock your device before you can access memory' type option that android has.\n\nA: This is a known iOS7 incompatibility in libimobiledevice versions 1.1.5 and earlier.  It was reported to the developers and subsequently fixed.  The fix is part of the 1.1.6 release.\nI can personally confirm that I saw the same problem under Fedora 20 with libimobiledevice 1.1.5.  Upgrading to a test build of libimobiledevice 1.1.6 ought to fix the problem, but actually runs into some other SELinux problems.\nSo assuming you don’t want to build from sources yourself, you need to convince your preferred Linux distribution to package, test, and ultimately ship libimobiledevice version 1.1.6 or later.\n", "Q: Global shortcut for New Mail in Thunderbird I would like to have a global shortcut key to send a new message using Thunderbird in Mac OS.

I need to restore my phone, I backed up all my photos onto a photstream going to my Ipad. Will they be deleted?\n\nA: The Photostream itself, populated with photos from the last 30 days(up to 1000 images), will still exist after you restore your phone. However, because of the transitory nature of Photostream, it would be prudent to direct the flow into a more permanent repository such as a computer. \nShared Photostreams persist beyond the 30 day limit. \nApple Support articles:\niCloud: My Photo Stream FAQ\niCloud: Using and troubleshooting Shared Photo Streams\n", "Q: Transfer downloaded iOS7 installer to home computer I am downloading the iOS7 update image for my iPhone over a high-speed connection. I want to update my wife's phone too, which is synched to her computer at home (where we have sloooow internet). \nIs there a relatively painless way to transfer the installer to her computer at home on a usb drive, so we can update her phone as well?\nEdit: mac on both ends and same model of iPhone. \nI found the ipsw on my computer here: \n~/Library/iTunes/iPhone\\ Software\\ Updates/iPhone5\\,1_7.0_11A465_Restore.ipsw\nI will try placing this in the same location on her computer and see if iTunes will recognize it.\n\nA: You need to start by being aware that each different model of phone has a unique package for the iOS upgrades. So if you and your wife are not on the same model phone and the same carrier, there is a chance that your download won't work on her phone.\nAssuming that you are on the same model phone (the size of the phone in GB doesn't matter), and if you are downloading your update via iTunes, then it will be stored on your computer somewhere. It will depend upon whether or not you are on a Mac or a PC, and which version of everything you have. A hard drive search for something like iOS_7* or ipsw should turn it up.\nCopy that to your USB drive, and then copy it to your home computer. Open iTunes on your home computer with your wife's phone connected, and press and hold \"Option\" key on the keyboard (for a Mac) or the \"Alt\" key (for windows -- I think), and click the restore button. When it prompts you to a file, point to the file that you copied off of your USB drive.\nMake a backup of the phone first. This method will cause iTunes to wipe the phone, and then you will need to restore it.\n", "Q: iTunes song iPhone 4S If I delete a song I got in iTunes from my iPhone 4S (IOS 6.3) do I have to pay again to download it? I have never sync with a PC or MAC, so it exists only in my iPhone.\n\nA: In the iTunes app on the phone, there is a \"Purchased\" tab. In there, you should be able to see everything that you have previously purchased, and download them anew.\n", "Q: Downgrade iphone 5 back to ios 6 I have a question is there a way to downgrade from ios 7 to ios 6 with an iphone 5?\nplease tell me yes i hate this update lol\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be much of solid chance of achieving this. I found this method on Lifehacker, and I haven't tested it, so try it at your own risk.\n\nThe first step is (again, always) to back up your device. Next go get the build of iOS 6 that your phone runs. If you've got an iPhone 5, that means grabbing iOS 6.1.4, the CDMA flavor if you are on Verizon or Sprint, and the GSM flavor if you are on AT&T or T-Mobile. If you've got something else (iPhone 4S and below, iPads 2-4, iPod Touch 4 or 5, or iPad Mini) you'll want 6.1.3. The same CDMA/GSM logic applies.\nDid you back up your device yet? Back up your device.\nNow put your phone into Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode by plugging it into the computer and holding the home button and the power button for 10 seconds. Then let go of the power button and only the power button, and keep the home button pressed down for another 10 seconds or so. The screen will stay black, but iTunes will detect a phone in recovery mode. It's worth noting that this isn't strictly necessary, but it does make matters a little simpler.\nIgnore any restore prompt iTunes throws at you. Specifically this one.\nOpen the panel for your iPhone and option-click/shift-click (OSX/Windows) on Restore iPhone.\nThis will give you a dialog box popup; use it to go find that ipsw file you downloaded after you backed up your device. And bam, you should be good to go. If things aren't working, try booting up your phone, disabling Find My iPhone, and do it all again.\nThere you go, back to skeumorphic goodness. Now just avoid installing iOS 7 for as long as you can bear it. And while you're doing that, try to make peace with the fact that iOS 7 is coming for you eventually, and there's pretty much nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Why isn't iTunes Radio presenting the options affecting station variety? I am not seeing the options in iTunes Radio for \"Play More Like This\" and \"Never Play This\" for individual songs, nor the \"Variety\" slider for each station.\n\n\nPer iTunes Help docs:\n\nWhile a song is playing, click  near the top-left of the iTunes window, and choose Play More Like This or Never Play This Song from the pop-up menu.\nAdjust the balance between new and familiar songs (on the selected station only): Click a station to display its contents, and click Hits (familiar), Variety (mixed), or Discovery (new).\n\nThese features are consistently missing across all of dozens of songs on multiple stations. I can't find anything in the Preferences (or the View, Window, or contextual menus) that seems relevant, except perhaps that I have \"Share details about your library\" turned off. Is it related? I tried turning it on and see no change.\nAn interesting twist is that I created a station on iOS 7, using an identical starting condition - the name of a band - to one of my existing stations, which has now synced to my OS X iTunes radio, and includes these options. The stations created on OS X have not transferred to the iDevice, however.\n1st Created on iOS, appeared on OS X.\n2nd Created on OS X, not present on iOS.\n\n\nWhy can't I tell iTunes that I don't ever want to hear \"Margaritaville\"?!\nThis is iTunes 11.1 (126) running on OS X 10.8.4\n\nA: It only works if you add your own custom stations. When you are listening to a song that you like, press on start station from artist or song. Then that new station will have the options on: play more like this, or never play this song. :) \n\nA: According the Apple support doc for iTunes Radio:\n\nThere may be some DJ-curated stations that you may not be able to\n  modify. You can't like or play more tracks like this while listening\n  to some DJ-curated stations. You can however, start new stations based\n  on the current track or artist of a featured station or add tracks to\n  your iTunes Wishlist from the Star (✭) menu.\n\nAs for the slider you can only use it on non-DJ-curated stations. Create a station from an artist or song then you will see the slider.\n", "Q: iOS 7 Music app crashes on startup I just upgraded to iOS 7 and my Music app is now crashing every time I try to launch it.\nI've tried rebooting my iPad, disabling iTunes Match, re-enabling iTunes Match, but nothing seems to let me access my music.\nAny thoughts on how I can reset my Music app?\n\nA: This has been reported here on Apple Support Community. Please try the solution posted there to see if it helps you.\nBasically, their suggestion is to restore a backup of the device.\n\nA: Thanks to the tip from Meryovi, I was able to resolve this.  The instructions on the link he supplied were close but not the complete story.\nI had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Perform a complete backup to iTunes on my computer (not iCloud)\n\n*Go to Settings -> iCloud -> Manage Storage ->  -> Delete Backup. (I don't know if this is strictly necessary or not)\n\n*Go to Settings -> General -> Reset and select \"Erase All Content and Settings\"\n\n*Do a full restore.\n\n\nThis solved my problem with the Music app crashing, the Settings app crashing on the About page, the iTunes app crashing, and the \"could not be completed\" failure during iCloud backups.\n", "Q: Can I undo changes made via \"defaults write\"? I've been messing with Bluetooth audio settings to try to keep my Bluetooth speakers from popping by changing settings via defaults write, but I'm afraid I've made the problem worse.\nI'd like to revert to the default… defaults, bringing them back to where they were originally or, more specifically, where they would be for a new user account or new system.  Is this as simple as using defaults delete on the appropriate domain and key?\n\nA: Yes, usually you can just use defaults delete\nIf for example you have run \ndefaults write -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled -bool false\n\nYou can undo the changes by running one of\ndefaults delete -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled\ndefaults write -g NSScrollAnimationEnabled -bool true\n\n(In all cases you need to restart the application to apply changes)\nEven if the preference key had some value before you used defaults it shouldn't matter if you delete the key. \nIt is generally safe to delete preference keys or even complete files, \nand they can usually be recreated by OS X or applications.\nThe property lists modified by defaults are stored in directories like \n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/\n\n*~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/\nYou can edit a plist in a text editor after converting it to XML with \nplutil -convert xml1 FILENAME\n\n", "Q: Mail.app sending wrong fonts to other email clients/browsers When sending emails from Mail.app, I have Georgia set as the default font in both the body copy and my email signature but they are not being sent correctly. I currently have Georgia 12pt set, and when I send it from Mail.app to ANY other email platform such as Sparrow.app, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Thunderbird, Outlook... Georgia is not being recognized. As a matter of fact, not even a serif font is being recognized. I've looked all over the internet, posted this issue in Google Forums, tried a Universal Email Plugin, and have had no luck. Does ANYONE know why I'm having this issue and how to fix it?\nPlease try to find an answer for Georgia. This is a common font and should not have issues. Seriously, Apple... what's going on?\n\nA: There are three things you're probably running into here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail, by default, correctly sends only a plain-text message. Plain text messages carry no style information and will be displayed by the recipient in their preferred typeface. Rich-text (HTML) messages are only sent if you've actually used rich-text features.\n\n*Mail, by default, correctly does not apply a font to rich-text (HTML) messages unless you have explicitly set one while composing it. This allows the recipient to view the message in their preferred typeface, which may well be the only way they can read it. (i.e. If you specify Georgia at 12 pt, it may be completely illegible to someone with impaired vision or a reading disorder.)\n\n*The \"Message font\" setting in Preferences controls your user interface. It does not affect the message, for reasons of #2, above.\n\n", "Q: How can I create a zip archive for Windows and Linux users?

Other wireless devices (phones and computers) can connect to the router, so I know the router is working. I've tried restarting my mac, and that didn't help.\nAny suggestions?\nI'm on OS 10.6.8\n\nA: I had the same problem (strangely, on the same day). My MacBook Pro would see and connect to the router but not be allowed past it, to the internet. Other devices had no such trouble, and resets of both the laptop and the router had no effect.\nIn my case, I had set a certain maximum number of DHCP clients on my router, and all the entries had been taken up. Raising this number by one allowed my MacBook to connect.\n\nA: Check your router. Is the area you live in currently offline right now? Or did you download software or software packages? Some may not work well with wireless. Also, you may want to restart the router, because it may also be having too much pressure on it and it may just look like it is ok. Also you might have accidentally connected to the wrong wifi, so check that as well. Also check the relationship between the modem and the router. If all else fails, call in a technician.\n", "Q: How can I get VMWare Fusion 6 to display in Unity with full resolution on a Retina display? As a long time (intimately familiar with 3.11) Windows user I finally made the jump to OS X. I was excited to take advantage of the massive resolution on my new MBP, and it's as awesome as I thought it would be.\nHowever, Unity + Windows looks terrible. I realize Windows was not built to take advantage of such jaw-dropping resolutions, but I still want it to run at native resolution. I find myself enjoying the OS X environment, and reluctant to leave it for a full screen Windows VM; Unity is becoming a must.\nI've tried checking the 'Use Full Resolution' setting to no avail.\n(Not sure if it makes a difference, but I'm running the Windows 8.1 preview)\nHow can I prevent Unity mode from displaying Windows in a clunky-looking, zoomed-in, pixelated view?\n\nA: I had the same issue with Windows 7 guest on a MBP 2013 retina display. It was solved for me by unticking the \"Automatically adjust user interface size in Windows\" checkbox.\n\n\nA: I don't know if this is the answer you are looking for, but I have a 2013 13\" Macbook Pro with 2 1920 x 1080 monitors attached. I'm running the newest version of Mavericks and windows 7.\nAt first when I was in unity, all my windows were huge and I couldn't figure out why. I tried to change the resolution of windows but that messed everything up and I had to exit and re-enter Unity to fix it.\nBut when I go Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization >Display, you'll see a window that talks about \"Make it easier to read what's on your screen\" and there are 3 options.\nSmaller - 100%; Medium - 125%; Larger - 150%. \nFor whatever reason, mine started at the 150%, but choosing 100% makes everything fit and look the correct size for my screens.\n", "Q: Can a Verizon iPad (4th Gen) be used on AT&T GSM/HSPA+?

It's unlocked, and you can move to any carrier you wish to. Of course, if you're planning to move off of Verizon, you would have to consider the terms dictated by your contract with Verizon.\nRead more on Are iPad Models Unlocked? - iPad Q&A (from EveryiPad.com). Here's a relevant quote:\n\nHowever, both of the iPad 4th Gen models with cellular data capability are sold \"unlocked\" and are capable of running on any compatible network. \n\nAlso, a footnote Apple's LTE page states (with emphasis here):\n\n2. To identify your iPad model number, see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5452. iPad models are unlocked and may support LTE networks outside the country of purchase when using a valid SIM from a supported carrier. Contact your carrier for more details.\n\n\nA: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4745210?start=0&tstart=0\nI googled this and found the two links in the answer. The top one basically says that you can drop any SIM card in because ipads are unlocked, and you'll have to change some carrier settings (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1970?viewlocale=en_US)\n\nA: I got an AT&T sim today for an iPad air Verizon and it worked with AT&T LTE. Compared speeds in the iPad Air 2 using the AT&T sim and they were equal. Back of my iPad Air box says it supports CDMA, GSM and a few other networks. \nTo respond to a previous it is not forcing me to use 3G speeds using the AT&T sim on a Verizon iPad Air. \n", "Q: Disable dismissing reminders from lock screen Can I prevent Reminders from being dismissed on the lock screen?

I do not want any random person to mark them as completed while the phone is locked.\niOS 6 would display the reminder, but required the passcode to dismiss it. Can I do the same in iOS 7?\n\nA: Try Settings > Notification Center > Reminders (second entry - with apps) > Show in Notification Center and Show on Lock Screen. Also choose whether you want \"banner\" or \"alert\" style notifications.\nThere is a third Reminders setting on the main settings page, but that only relates to how long you keep old reminders around, and which list of reminders you want to use.

I am hearing Apple is going to stop shipping Java with 10.8 and beyond but I couldn't find any link to confirm it/deny it.\n\nA: Apple did stop shipping Java as of 10.7 and higher. Neither the JDK nor the JRE come preinstalled. However, the first time you need a JRE, Mac OS X will offer to download and install it for you (via the Software Update mechanism).\nSimilarly, javac is stubbed in a base OS X install and will trigger the install process.\nNote that the Apple JRE/JDK is Java 1.6—if you need 1.7 or 1.8, you'll need to get it yourself from Oracle.\n\nA: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with 10.8, but the Java Development Kit (JDK) is not - that you'll need to install yourself.\n", "Q: iOS 7 automatically downloaded to phone after downgrading to iOS 6 I have downgraded my iPhone 4 from iOS 7 to iOS 6.1.3, but when it went back to iOS 6, the Software Update section of Settings is showing that iOS 7 is automatically downloading again. I tried to downgrade my phone again and again but it's not working.\n\nA: Your iPhone software update is trying to be smart by downloading the update in the background for iOS 7. What it is trying to do is make sure that the update is already on your device, and all you need to do is press the update button, without waiting for a download to finish.\nYou aren't in danger of loosing your downgrade - your phone will always ask your permission before installing any update. You probably won't be able to keep it from downloading the update, though.\n", "Q: How do I reset iCloud podcasts syncing?

I have disabled Documents and Data syncing in iOS 7 to overcome the sluggish keyboard issue. But I wonder what the consequences of turning Docu and Data sync off are?\n\nA: The consequence is data stays the same on your Mac and isn't kept in sync with other devices that use iCloud sync.\nYou can test if this is the cause of slowness by just disconnecting from the network.\nTurning off iCloud documents is simple though and you can always turn it on again if you find something else was causing the slowness or you wish to have an easier time getting files back and forth.\n\nA: I'm sure I don't know all the consequences, however what you are doing is localizing your files. A file on an iDevice stays on that device, and a file on a mac, stays on the Mac. That's not just with Apple apps (Pages, Numbers, TextEdit, Preview), but also with any iCloud-enabled app (Coda, Rapidweaver, etc. ).

Provider settings will just be the same as well.\n\nA: iOS Updates are controlled by Apple, not by your provider. So you're free to update your phone any time, as long as it's supported on your model. \nI'd also ask my provider if they would be willing to remove that lock, most of them no longer insist on keeping your phone locked to their network anymore, and might be persuaded with a little begging. \n", "Q: How can I prevent iTunes from automatically opening the downloaded audio files?

All running iOS7. On all of the devices, I access a site which has a 'remember me' cookie to save me having to log in again. This works fine on all devices except for one iPad 2. I have gone through all the safari settings and they match the other devices. I'm stuck now. What is the problem? It happened on iOS6 as well. The cookie appears to get deleted when I turn the ipad off and then back on.\nI cleared the cookies and data in case that was the problem, but it still doesn't remember on this device.\n\n\nA: Make sure safari is not running in \"private\" mode.

A few days ago I wanted to upgrade my iOS to version 7, but before I could do this I had to make room by deleting programs that didn't help so much. \nSo I was forced to delete my music library on my iPhone. And not really thinking about my new purchased music that hasn't been synchronized with iCloud or iTunes. So I lost my new music. \nHow do I get the music back without buying the music twice? I did a small test by buying one of the songs and Apple charged me again.\n\nA: On your iOS 7 device: \n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes \n\n*Go to the \"Other\" tab\n\n*Go to Purchased \n\n\nThere you have the songs you bought. You can download them without Apple charging you again. \nIf Apple charged you again, it's either: \n\n\n*\n\n*You bought another version of the song\n\n*You bought it with another iTunes account\n\n", "Q: New IOS7 configured with wrong Apple ID Help!\nI updated my apple ID with a different email a while ago but somehow it was not wired onto my device and now I can't delete the account (with the old INACTIVE email) because of safety features. How can I do this???\n\nA: I had this exact issue after updating to iOS 7 an hour or so ago.  The ultimate resolution, although it took me an embarrassingly long time to arrive at, was to log in using my current Apple ID password, ignoring the out-of-date apple ID, while attempting to delete the iCloud association (as you are already attempting to do).\nA couple of things that I had done in the mean time that might have helped things along unexpectedly:\n\n\n*\n\n*I logged into icloud.apple.com using my current credentials.\n\n*I logged into appleid.apple.com and added a (heretofore) missing year to my Date of Birth.\n\n\nI sincerely doubt either of these changes had any impact, but I thought I'd mention them in case you want something to try if your current password does not work.\n\nA: If you find yourself locked out of your Apple ID account, you might need to contact support to get the information reset and/or reactivated.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/support/appleid/contact/\n", "Q: IOS 7 iPad keyboard is unresponsive After downloading IOS 7 on my iPad, there is a 15-20 second delay between touching a keyboard character and the letter appearing on the screen.\n\nA: Anytime iOS is seeming sluggish to me, I like to place it in Airplane mode to see if it's a network issue slowing things down.  For a delay that long, I would then power down the device and restart it while still in Airplane mode. \nAt that point you will know if your OS or device has issues to its just doing a lot of work. \nFrom there, I would start at http://support.apple.com/iPad and start the troubleshooting assistant to narrow done the cause.\n\nA: I updated to iOS 7 today, was going off my head with the unresponsive keyboard. Big delays, looked up potential bugs on google. Go into iCloud settings and switch off the toggle switch in documents and data.

The clouds don't move on my weather app. My husband and friends' weather apps have animated clouds. Why doesn't mine?\n\nA: There are many graphical upgrades in iOS 7 that simply don't work on iPhone 4 because of the relative lack of processing/GPU power. See this Ars Technica article for a list of the features disabled on iPhone 4.\n\nWhat don't you get?\nThe slowest devices in Apple's lineup tend not to get every single feature that the newer ones get. Generally, this is either because the old hardware is incapable of supporting it or because the device's aging system-on-a-chip (SoC) isn't fast enough to provide a good experience. The iPhone 4 gets most of the features we highlighted in our massive iOS 7 review, but there's a long list of fine print attached. Let's run through not just the list of iOS 7 features it misses out on, but also the features from previous iOS versions that it isn't privy to. If the feature is on this list, it's missing from the iPhone 4.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*3D Flyover or turn-by-turn navigation in Maps.\n  \n*Panorama mode or Filters in the Camera app (filters can still be applied after-the- fact in the Photos app).\n  \n*AirPlay Mirroring.\n  \n*Siri.\n  \n*AirDrop.\n  \n*A number of the new graphical effects present on all other iOS 7 devices. These include translucency effects throughout the OS, live wallpapers, and the parallax effect used on the Home screen.\n  \n\n\nA: This is by design.\nThe iPhone 4 does not support animations in weather app. Nor does it support the parallax effect on the home screen. Such graphical effects are considered \"too heavy\" for the iPhone 4 to run smoothly. Thus, Apple has removed such features from the iPhone 4 for the sake of smoothness.\n", "Q: What kind of prepaid iPhone can I use in Europe? What kind of prepaid iPhone can I use in Europe and the US?\n\nA: Apple lists all current iPhone models at:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3939\nYou'll need to determine which carrier you like in the US and Europe and see if the phone you want speaks GSM/CDMA for basic service like calls and SMS. Visual Voicemail will work on most carriers that sell iPhones, and LTE coverage and other higher speed data varies widely. See http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE for the bands that certain countries use as well as details of which models work in which bands.\n", "Q: Why do these apps \"like to access the microphone\"? The apps Google Maps and Waze request access to the microphone.\n \n\nEnable microphone access to play audio on bluetooth devices and more.\n\nThe explanation doesn't make sense to me. What does \"play audio on bluetooth devices\" have to do with the microphone? And what does \"more\" include?\n\nA: It's a new permission that Apple added with iOS 7 to let you know which apps need to access the microphone.\nNow, for those apps that do not relate to the microphone, my guess would be one of 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Developers of such apps did not update their apps to iOS 7, so the OS needs to ask for your permission on accessing the microphone, or\n\n*Developers did update their apps to iOS 7, but they did not address this API in their code yet.\n\n\nEither way, we should see less of these pop up messages as iOS 7 becomes more mainstream and developers get the time to update their apps fully.\nIn my experience, not a single app \"broke\" for denying it access to the microphone, so it should be fine to hit \"Don't Allow\".\n\nA: Either the bluetooth audio profile itself is incapable of allowing sound out with also enabling sound in or Apple programmed things to be linked together.\nI can't imagine what waze is doing with microphone entitlements, but you could always ask them on their support forum. Google's notification makes sense to me and I bet you would find that google maps audible direction works just fine even if you deny microphone access.\nI have heard of devices and apps using sound to locate nearby phones and do proximity location within buildings and malls. I bet Google is working on that even if the app you have isn't making use of that yet.\n", "Q: DNS Zones not working after OS X 10.8.5 upgrade Prior to upgrading from OS X 10.8.4 to 10.8.5, I had the following DNS zone file in place that worked perfectly fine - now it's failing:\n;\n; BIND data file for dev sites\n;\n$TTL    604800\n@       IN      SOA     dev. root.devcs1.

The iPhone 5S won't be released where I live until maybe a month or two. I would like to get my hands on one from the US (better prices than UK) but I want it to be unlocked.\nApparently only the iPhone 5C is available unlocked from the US online Apple Store. I was wondering when would the 5S be sold unlocked as well ?\n\nA: By the time an unlocked iPhone 5S becomes available in the US Store, it will be also available in the UK.\nIf you are in a hurry, you can grab an unlocked iPhone 5S from the Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Hong Kong and many other stores around the globe.\n\nA: Here is what we know:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone 5c is for sale unlocked in the US at launch.\n\n*The iPhone 5s is not for sale unlocked in the US at launch. It is unlocked at launch in many countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, etc...\n\n*The last phone launch had no 5c / 5s comparison (unless you want to ignore the 5c and assume the 5s is handled identically to the 5 at launch.)\n\n*The iPhone 5 launch was September 21, 2012 and as of Thursday, November 29, 2012, you still could not buy a full price unlocked iPhone 5.\n\n\nI would recommend you get confirmation that T-Mobile will unlock their contract-free but locked phone after a fixed amount of time or money, and get that in writing before you buy a US phone that isn't unlocked if you really need an unlocked iPhone.\nIn informal discussions today, I was told that two months of service needs to be maintained before you can ask for an unlock, but I didn't get it in writing and can't find any mention of it on T-Mobile's web site. Realize that any mobile carrier has limited devices and won't really want to sign up someone that will increase their churn rate and not be a \"paying subscriber\" when it comes time for them to report their quarterly subscriber counts.\n\nA: Purchasing an AT&T iPhone 5S as a \"Device Only\" (full price, no contract) transaction will in fact result in a factory unlocked phone, contrary to whatever the salespeople might say. I can confirm that my launch day 5S works with AT&T, T-Mobile, Telus, and China Unicom SIMs. Just make sure you replace the included AT&T SIM with one from another carrier before turning on the phone.\nThis only applies to devices purchased at an Apple Store and will not work for those bought at an AT&T Store or a retailer like Best Buy or RadioShack.\n\nA: i called t mobile today about contract free unlocked mobile and they told me that at least pre paid  1 month should be paid to get iphone 5s it will cost almost 750 $ i asked her that if it is confirmed that we can use it world wide after 1 month because i want to use it in Egypt she told me i have to ask my carrier and thier is no information because its did not released in egypt yet..i dunn know from where i can be sure that i can use world wide\n\nA: I have contacted a Genius on the Apple US website and she told me that the iPhone 5s T-Mobile contract-free is in fact unlocked and will work with any GSM SIM. I am based in Dubai, UAE. I ordered two 5s' and had the address of a freight forwarder and within a couple of days, I got sent a cancellation email for my order as Apple do not send any product to freight forwarders. What a shame. Just gonna wait till whenever they release it officially here in the UAE as prices are sky-high now. Either mid-October or December... The sooner the better. Cannot wait!\n\nA: I just used the chat service on Apple's website to gather the following information about iPhone 5S, which I think is quite useful:\nOct 14, 2013; based in the USA\n\n\n*\n\n*The contract-free version from T-Mobile is for sale right now for\n$649.00.\n\n*This version is not factory unlocked, because it doesn't support CDMA\nnetworks (like Verizon or Sprint). It will only work on a GSM network, and has to   have a sim card.\n\n*This contract free phone CAN be used internationally or with a different carrier in the US, and it DOES NOT need to be unlocked. Provided the phone supports your network of choice, \"once it arrives to you, all you will need to do is take it to a different carrier, and they will change out the sim card for you.\"\n\n*This reason this phone is advertised under the name \"T-Mobile contract-free\" is the fact that it comes with a T-Mobile sim card installed.\n\n\nI understand these don't answer your questions, but for those in the US, this can be very helpful. At least for me, it helped clarify what phones will work on what networks and such.\n", "Q: What's the difference between Background App Refresh in iOS 7 and multitasking in iOS 6? Didn't iOS 6 support multitasking and allow background apps to refresh their content? So what's new in iOS 7? Just that we can enable/disable specific apps from accessing the network when running in the background?\nAlso, I see that the Pandora app is not present in this list (Settings → General → Background App Refresh) and yet it works fine when in the background and fetches data when on 3G. How does this work?\n\nA: I actually went to the WWDC session on this, so I have a little bit of insight on the subject. To my understanding, in iOS 7:\n\n\n*\n\n*The app tells the system if it wants to use background app refresh.\n\n*If the app wants to use the feature, the system analyzes your usage patterns for that app (you open it every morning around 7, once an hour, on third Tuesdays, etc.),\n\n*After the system thinks it has your pattern for the app figured out, it gives the app an amount of time right before it thinks you are going to open the app.\n\n\nWhen would this be useful? For apps with dynamic, updating content. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Twitter\n\n*Facebook\n\n*A Stack Exchange app\n\n*A news app\n\n*An RSS reader\n\n*etc.\n\n\nBassically, any app with content that updates often would benefit from this feature.\nAs a user, it means that when you open an app after the system figures out your usage patterns, you are going to see very recent content - instead of content still cached from the last time you opened the app.\nAlso, developers love this feature - at one point, there were several developers around Tim Cook thanking him for such a feature, and trying to make sure that is wouldn't go away.\n\nA: iOS 4 and greater supported multitasking for some specific use cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*A program needing a limited amount of time to finish a task (such as uploading a file) and can be suspended after that. It would not be woken up until the user went back to the app.\n\n*Playing audible content to the user while in the background, such as Pandora.\n\n*Recording audio while in the background\n\n*Keeping the user informed of their location, such as a navigation app\n\n*VoIP apps like Skype\n\n*Newstand apps which update content occasionally\n\n*Communicating with plugged in accessories (added in iOS 5)\n\n*Apps which communicate with Bluetooth devices (added in iOS 6)\niOS 7 adds two additional use cases for multitasking.\n\n\n*\n\n*A program can register that it wants to download small sets of information regularly. For example, it could download twitter updates regularly. This new API allows you to specify that you'd like to be woken up to download information every so often.  For instance, a program could say it wants to download information after it's been asleep at least fifteen minutes.  The system will then try to find a time where it can wake up as many apps at once to do their work.  Minimizing the number of times the device wakes up will help it save battery.\n\n*A program can register to be woken to download content if it receives a remote notification.  The idea is that it can download the content and be ready to display it if you go into the app.\n", "Q: OSX equivalent for reset On linux machines I used to type reset on terminal.\nIt was like, closing and reopening the terminal!\nIt is very convenient, because in debugging you wont mix error messages from previous executions.\nThe command does exists on OSX, however when i scroll up, the previous output is there too!\n\nA: As you mentioned, reset does work in OS X, however you can combine it with ⌘ cmd + ⌥ alt/option + K to 'Clear Scrollback'. This clears Terminal's history scrollback.\nAlternatively, you can just use ⌘ cmd + K to 'Clear All'. This works similarly to how you use reset in Linux.\n\nA: In OSX's Terminal.app, you can hit command + K\nThis will clear your terminal session completely.\nAlso see this\nUse the right tool for each job:\nUse clear to clear the terminal window.\nUse reset to reset your terminal when it gets messed up by control sequences.\nUse cat only when you want to stream a whole lot of data from one place to another uninterrupted.\n", "Q: iOS7 Contacts Have All Disappeared I upgraded to iOS 7 yesterday. Today, all my contacts suddenly vanished. They were working in iOS 7 this morning, but have since disappeared.\nI'm not syncing contacts with an external system (Exchange, iCloud, Google, etc.). All of the contacts were on my phone only. They are still in my computer's Address Book, but when I sync to the phone and check the Contacts box under \"Replace Information on This Phone,\" no contacts show up on the phone.\nPhone favorites and text messages still exist, but as numbers only.\nI could manually reenter them, but if there's an underlying problem, I don't want to spend the effort and then lose them again later.\nMost Googling has returned no help for the current version. And solutions are to use things like iSync, which doesn't exist on Lion.\n\nA: Finally found the solution. If this happens to you, try turning on (or turning off/on) the iCloud contact syncing, even if you don't think you're using it.\nI turned it back on (I never realized it was on) and all my contacts came back. I guess the phone was using iCloud to sync contacts all along and I wasn't aware of it.\n\nA: Also checkout the options within Contacts on the phone because my partner had a similar problem with most of his contacts missing and he found that the setting on his phone was set to Hide Contacts and when he changed to Show all Contacts, his full list re-appeared.  We had tried all sorts on the PC to fix the sync problem (he had a full list of contacts on his iPad) to no avail.\n\nA: IOS7 is only compatable with latest iTunes, so as I had not updated recently the cloud contact synch could not work at all- now updated and contacts returned\n", "Q: Is there a way to get different Google calendars syncing with different Apple devices? I'm trying to sync several Google calendars with my iPhone, iPad and Mac, but I don't want all of my Google calendars to show up on the phone, just a certain few. You used to be able to go to the Google sync settings and choose which calendars to sync with which device, but when I tried to make some changes today (at google. com/sync/index.html), it changed for all of my devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac mini). Searching Google Support confirmed this is intended (https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/99358):\n\nIf you’d like to sync any additional calendars, or remove any of My calendars from syncing, visit https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect and select the calendars you’d like displayed. Refresh iCal, or close and restart in order to see your new selection.\nThese settings will apply to any device you sync using CalDAV, such as your iPhone or other iOS device.\n\nIs there still a way to get different Google calendars syncing with different Apple devices?\nEdit: To clarify, say I have Google calendars A, B, and C. I want my Mac to sync with all three (A, B, C), but I want my iPad to sync with A & B, and my iPhone to sync with just A. How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: From my understanding you decide at  https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect which calendars are to be synced with CalDav devices. No more, no less.\nOn the devices themself you can choose which calendars you want them to displayed. (It know this is quite trivial, but I do not quite see why this does not suffice).\nAlternatively I would suggest creating mutiple Google accounts each one with its own CalDav syncing settings.\nFor each one you can decide which calendars are to be shared via CalDav. Each of your devices would be connected with one of these Google Account.\nThen you share calendars among the Google accounts.\nE.g.: Lets say A has all the calendars. You have an iPad and an iPhone. For each one create a google account (B and C). Now A shares the iPad related calendars with B and the iPhone related calendars with C. The iPad syncs with B, the iPhone with C.\nIt is not ideal but once set up it should run without any overhead.\n", "Q: How to get Mail.app to show email addresses?

In the stock camera app, iOS 7 has added a new burst mode feature that takes multiple photos in succession for as long as the shutter is pressed. Is there any way I can turn this feature off and have the app behave like the old one?\n\nA: According to this article, there is no way to turn off burst mode.\n\nThis can be quite handy for catching just the right shot. However, for those of you that had learned to stabilize your camera by holding down the shutter button instead of tapping it, this can result in a lot of unexpected pictures. This feature appears to be enabled full-time whether you want it or not, so we'll all need to simply learn to adapt. Or delete. A lot.\n\nHere are a couple of alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the shutter button instead of pressing it for long\n\n*Use third party camera apps\n\n\nA: Currently iOS7 does not allow turning off burst mode when holding on the shutter button. This can be incredibly annoying for those who are used to holding on the shutter button and releasing to capture a shot in motion or taking a selfie. Also, you now need to be very careful when handing your camera to someone to take your picture as they may shoot off 20-30 images without knowing. Also, even with your flash set to 'on' the camera app does not wait for the flash to recharge and will shoot off many unusable images between flash cycles.\n", "Q: Can't run Intel Driver Update Utility on OS X I cannot run the Intel Driver Update Utility on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.5). All Java options are enabled (have tested in Safari, Firefox and Chrome) and latest Java version installed. It keeps saying \"Loading…\" until a message pops up saying…\n\nThe Intel Driver Update Utility failed. Possible web browser compatibility, firewall or installation issue detected. Select OK to troubleshoot the issue.\n\nAny ideas?\nPS: I don't use any other firewall software other than the OS included one.\n\nA: Unfortunately the Intel Drivers Utility does not work with Mac OS.\nIt is only windows based application. \nFrom http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/iduufaq:\n\nThe Intel Driver Update Utility supports the following operating systems:  \nWindows 8*\nWindows 7*\nWindows Vista*\nWindows XP*\nWindows Server 2008*\nWindows Server 2003*\n\nOperating systems not supported: Apple*, Linux*, and operating system emulators\n\n", "Q: Iphone: outgoing email iCloud account and gmail Iphone 5 iOS 6.1 (jaikbroken)\nOK, I've been solely using the gmail app for a while now and haven't had any use for the built-in mail app.  Was hoping to run without any mail account on there, but it gets me in trouble for those times some other app wants to send email and finds no mail account.\nSo finally I was setting up gmail just for outgoing smtp but even doing so it forces me to include incoming imap account and it annoys me just on principal to have local duplicate copies of the last 50 messages I don't need.\nSo I created an icloud account today so I could sync notes and also just use that now for the sent messages.  iCloud mail is set to forward incoming to gmail, but it wont forward outgoing.  Obviously.  \nTrying to devise a workaround.  What I want is to have all my mail in gmail. My thinking is something like:\n\n\n*\n\n*if possible everything outgoing from icloud gets CC'd to gmail\n\n*set a filter in gmail, maybe everything with  from:(me)@icloud.com and bcc:(me)@gmail.com gets moved to sent mail.  \n\n\nAny thoughts, advice, or better ideas welcomed!\n\nA: You can setup your iCloud account to send using the Gmail SMTP server.\nSetting => Mail, Contacts, Calendar => iCloud => Account => Advanced (Mail) => Outgoing mail server (SMTP) => Other SMTP Serveres => Add Server here you can set up the Gmail SMTP server: smtp.gmail.com - remember to choose the Gmail server, and de-activate the iCloud SMTP server afterwards.\nThe mails sent will however appear in iCloud's sent folder.\nThe iCloud sender email address will however still be the iCloud address. If you use the build in Mail.app, you can manually choose your Gmail address (and the mail will appear in Gmail's sent folder), but how you can use this one, the way you want to use it - I don't know.\n\nA: OK, lets make this in a answer.\nYou might be a good candidate for the Postfix app.\nIt is already a part of the OS X just not activated.\nThere are plenty of online instructions how to customized it to your needs.\nConfiguring Postfix to Send Mail from Mac OS X Mountain Lion\n===============================================\nIf you just want to send all of your outgoing mail to some relay server, like the SMTP server of your Internet service provider, you usually need to have a host name for the computer that is sending the mail. This configuration is for a server that is not being used to receive mail.\n===============================================\nSometimes we may need to send mails from localhost for testing purposes. That can be easily done using an external Mail client (Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo… ETC) and Postfix, which is the standard email server installed by default in Mac OS X (At least in the latest versions).\nThis tutorial is about how to configure Postfix for Mac OS X.\n===============================\nAs I’m constantly trying and changing my default email application on my Mac, I’m currently using Thunderbird, the native email application and also Pilot.\nSo, decided to use my own local SMTP in order to not store my credentials on each application, and for an easy configuration. Also because I like emails to go fast from y outbox. Then it will be Postfix responsibility to deliver the email properly.\nThe problem is that my laptop is constantly changing its IP, so most of my emails will not get its destinations if I try to deliver them directly from the Macbook.\nWhat I did, was to configure postfix to relay on Gmail to deliver my emails.\nInstallation\nThere is nothing to install postfix is already installed on my Mac.\n", "Q: Is there a way to prevent iOS 7 from changing the colors of wallpaper images? When I create a custom wallpaper image and assign it to the lock screen on iOS 7, the colors of the image are changed. Oddly, if I take a screen capture of the lock screen, the colors match those of the original image.\nIs there a way to prevent this? Is it intentional? Perhaps there's something subtle about color management on iOS that I'm missing.\n\nNote: Providing images that document this is (clearly) tricky, but I hope to have some soon. In the meantime, perhaps this is a known issue or feature that someone can help with.\n\nA: There is a toggle you can flip to increase this effect even further.\nSettings -> General -> Accessibility -> Increase Contrast\nI'm a bit surprised the screen capture restores the original color, but I'm not surprised that on iOS devices with a powerful GPU that processing is happening on something as layered as the home screen / springboard view. That processing is one of the main design features of iOS 7 as I see it. Increasing text legibility on the home screen and the lock screen are clearly design considerations I would expect to see - even if they are subtle or slight as you describe for your current choice of custom image.\n", "Q: iOS 7 screen is still shaking after reboot I have tried changing the Parallax setting (general>accessibility>reduce motion).  Still shaking!!\nWeird thing...the shaking only appeared after re-booting my phone the first time after updating to ios 7.  After updating to iOS 7 initially, the screen did not shake.  Strange?\nWhat can I do to resolve this?\n\nA: I had it very bad since the upgrade - 24/7 - I changed my settings (General > Accessibility > Invert Colours) to invert the colours and it worked.  It's a bandaide but at least I can read my messages and mail.  My pictures however look like negatives..\n", "Q: Can I charge 2006 or 2007 MacBook with a charger for iPad or iPhone 5? Can I charge 2006 or 2007 MacBook with a charger for iPad or iPhone 5?\nSounds little bit crazy but wouldn't be great if you could use one charger for any Apple device? ;o))))))\n\nA: Nope. The iDevice charger has a very limited power output that would be insufficent for running the macbook, let alone charging it.\nGoing the other way around, however, is a little more doable, an adaptor could be made, but at that point you may as well just plug your iDevice into your macbook's usb port and be done with it.\n\nA: It would be nice but technically not very feasible.\nWhile all the devices have same Voltage (5 Volt) the problem is in Current requirement.\nTo make the story short, \nThe charger can not be to big (since the receiver will only take as much as it needs).\nHowever if the Charger is to small (iphone), it will run very hot since the receiver (Mac) will draw as much as it needs and gets. Since it will not get enough the Mac would not work properly.\nEither the charge will die soon, or it will take ages to charge.\n", "Q: Will a 45 W MagSafe Charger work for MacBook model A1181 (2007)? Is a 45 W MagSafe Charger going to work for MacBook model A1181 (2007)?\n...or I need 60 or 85 W charger?\nDoes 45 W MagSafe only work for MacBook Air or also for other Apple Macbooks?\n\nA: Apple says 60W. Page 7 of this pdf manual.\n45W is just for the MacBook Air\n\nA: The only real issue is sometimes if the battery is completely drained, you must wait 2-5 minutes for it to charge up before the machine will even boot. You can use it with any MacBook Pro etc even 17\" but for sure you will see this issue and hate it at the larger/ higher newer models. \nMuch longer charging times for battery also. 30-70% est. \nBut in fact, because of the slow charging, may make batteries last longer. \nWon't damage anything in laptop. \nVery very small risk of damage, short or failure in the adapter itself. Like 10%. Fire risk? 1/100,000 or less I would estimate. And I know a little about these things. Still hard to say.\nOne other issue is having my techs scream that they killed a laptop... When it's just they are trying to boot a 17\" with a 60 or 45 watts power adapter. Sooner or later, if there is even one non-85 watt in the shop or home. This will happen. \nDon't be cheap.

How can I install XCode without an update? I don't want to download large updates since my internet is highly charged.\n\nA: XCode 5 requires 10.8.4 as a minimum.\nIf you have a Apple developer account, you could try to download an older version (XCode 4.6.3 should work in 10.7 or 10.8).\nHowever, XCode 4.6.3 is still a hefty download (1.81 GB). It may be cheaper for you to download & install OSX 10.8.5 rather than XCode 4.6.3 - especially if you've already downloaded XCode 5...\n", "Q: Spoofing MAC address in a persistent fashion So I like to set a new, randomly-generated MAC address after every restart using\nruby -e 'print (\"%02x\"%((rand 64)*4|2))+(0..4).inject(\"\"){|s,x|s+\":%02x\"%(rand 256)} + \"\\n\"'\nand then copy/pasting the output after the command\nsudo ifconfig en0 ether \nso that I get a new IP address from my ISP each day.

How can I combine these two commands so that ifconfig takes the generated output of the ruby command in a single step? And then, how can I get that to automatically run at startup?\nThank you.\n\nA: Run EDITOR=nano sudo crontab -e and add a line like this:\n@reboot ifconfig en0 ether $(printf \\%02x $(($RANDOM\\%128*2)))$(head -c4 /dev/random|hexdump -v -e '/1 \":\\%02x\"')\nCommands scheduled by @reboot are run after you restart or turn the computer on but not after you log out and back in. % has to be escaped as \\% in crontab.\nFrom a comment at http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/10/random-mac-address-generator/:\n\nYou need to be careful that this does not generate multicast mac addresses, as these are technically illegal as source macs. The strict definition of a multicast mac address is one where the least significant bit of the first byte is set to 1. So if the first octet’s LSB is 1 (01, 03,05, a1, etc) you technically have a multicast mac source. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address.\nUsing multicast src macs might not cause immediate connectivity problems, but certainly has implications for switches learning the mac address preventing unicast flooding, and routers allowing arp to resolve.\nCisco, for example, will not allow mac learning if the source is non-unicast, and Cisco routers will not install arp entries for multicast macs to unicast ip addresses.\n\n", "Q: Which devices support iOS 7's burst mode? The new burst mode in iOS 7 was demoed at the iPhone event, but I couldn't tell whether that's just a feature of the iPhone 5S or whether that was an iOS 7 feature. Which devices support it?\n\nA: According to TechCrunch:\n\nAll phones capable of installing iOS 7 get a variant of burst mode, in fact, which takes pictures in rapid succession, but not at the 10fps rate of the iPhone 5s, and without the auto selection feature that suggests which shot is best.\n\nAnd CNET:\n\nWhat Apple didn't mention is that older iOS devices would also be gaining the ability to take photos in succession, just not nearly as fast or with the same software powering the editing process.\n\nTUAW:\n\nYou can use burst mode on older models of the iPhone, and it works pretty well, but you don't get the speed nor the auto-selection mode that burst mode on the iPhone 5s has.\n\n\nA: From Apple's website, only the 5s supports burst mode. From left to right (5s, 5c, 4s).\n\nSource: http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/\n", "Q: Setting iCal Calendar defaults I have a calendar with birthdays in them and I'd like to set the repeat to \"Every year\" -- unfortunately setting each manually seems quite painful.

How am I supposed to recover file without using a command line?\nI run Mac OS X 10.8.5\n\n\nA: I always thought that MacOSX had a Restore Option for individual files. The screenshot shows how to \"undelete\" a file. It will be moved back to its original location.\n\n\nA: Option 1\n\n\n*\n\n*With the item still in the Trash, right-click on it with your mouse and select Put Back. This will restore the item to where it was before you deleted it.\n\n\nNote: If the original location no longer exists, then this will be greyed out! \n\n\nOption 2\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the item in the Trash and select \"Copy muCommander\"\n\n\n*Once the item is copied, navigate in Finder to where you want to put it, and right-click in the background of the folder or your Desktop and select Paste Item.\n\n\nUsing Keyboard\nKeyboard commands for OS X are:\nCopy Command ⌘+C\nPaste Command ⌘+V\nThe Cut command is a little bit of a bitch when it comes to files. Don't rely on it\n\nA: Why simple when you can do it complicated. \nYou can just drag'n'drop it from Trash to where you wana have it (probably the Applications Folder cause it is an Application).\n\nA: It depends on how you trashed the file. Unfortunately there is no simple restore to original place.  It only works if you trashed the file by using Finder or if the app used the correct API call (although reading the github issues for various command line utilities which try to use this, Apple have broken that API). Just moving the file to trash is not enough which is what a lot of programs do. I suspect this Finder behaviour was added in some version of OSX so old ones won't have it - or else I never trashed anything correctly.)\nIf you used the Finder to trash it see this other answer\nIf not :\nWhat you do is copy the file from trash (Copy is on the pop up menu you show) and then navigate in Finder to where you want it to go and then paste it. If you have two Finder windows open you can drag and drop the file from Trash to where you want it.\n", "Q: OSX High CPU Usage Are the following CPU usages normal??\nFrom last few days my macbook air is heating too much.

The solution is to switch off parental controls for the account, then reboot.\n", "Q: iPhone restore error \"This device isn't eligible for the requested build\" - tried everything..? I restored my iPhone 4s yesterday on my computer and it went through with no problems.  \nToday when my iPhone crashed and I tried to restore it again - I keep getting the message \"This device isn't eligible for the requested build\".\nNothing has changed from yesterday - so I don't know why it was OK then but not now...\nI've worked through the apple suggestions - no problems with the hosts file, no third party security software, firewall off, etc  I've even tried it on another computer and I'm still getting the same message.

The message indicates that Apple no longer signing that version of software.\nYesterday, the code signing servers would sign the iOS 6 package you had downloaded on your Mac and let the device install that version of the OS.\nToday, Apple is no longer signing that version of the software for that device.\nI don't know how to say this other than Apple is forcing your hand to upgrade whether you are ready or not.\nHad you used a jailbreaking tool to save the signature, you would have been able to replay that signing activity and possibly trick iTunes into restoring iOS 6. I wish I had better news, but you may have to jump to iOS 7 unless someone invents a new exploit to jailbreak iOS 6 in the absence of Apple's signing servers being cooperative with iOS 6.\n", "Q: RAID 1 with a Mac - how to avoid formatting one of the drives I have an iMac with an external 2TB HDD. I recently bought a second 2TB HDD in order to build a RAID 1 (mirrored) with the two drives.\nThe problem is that Disk Utility forces me to create a new RAID set, add both drives to the set and then format the whole set (every drive in it) in order to build the set.\nI'm doing it this way, first because I have other disks where I can temporary put all the files that were on the 2TB disk, and second because I'm choosing the 256k block size (I'm dealing almost only with large files).\nAnyway, if I want to add a third drive to the set in the future, should I repeat the process of dumping the contents of the RAID set, re-format all the drives and then put the contents back in place or there's an easier way out?\n\nA: That's basically the only way unless you have one of the older mac pro's with the raid card. if I was you over usb id leave them as stand alone drives. \n", "Q: Can't resize (FileVault) partition after Bootcamp removal I have a recent Mac with two partitions. The first one contains MacOS, and is encrypted with FileVault. The second one contained a Bootcamp Windows installation. Here is a screen shot:\n\nI deleted the Bootcamp partition to reclaim space. Turns out: as a FileVault partition can't be resized, it can not grow to use the extra space.\nWhat must I do to have one big partition again? \n\nA: As @alan-shutko pointed out with a hyperlink, the only way to resize a encrypted partition is to disable encryption, (rebooting again,) then changing the size. It worked for me!\nIt's a lengthy process if you wait for it, but bearable if you let the decryption happen overnight.\n\nA: An alternative to the disabling encryption is to use command diskutil cs resizeStack\nThe details on how it works has been documented by Klanomath here\nOne thing I wanted to add is that it also works with FileVault.

If not how hard would it be to make an app that does this function?\n\nA: The iOS Contacts app allows pauses and waits to be programmed into phone numbers. \nWith the number input pad visible, press the special characters key on the lower left.\nThis will reveal options to input 2 second pauses (you can use multiple pauses to increase the time) or to wait until the dial key is pressed again.\n\n\n", "Q: iOS 7 update failed - stuck on Connect to iTunes I was downloading iOS 7 to my iPhone 4 and the update was going for almost 1 day. I left it overnight and when I was about to use my phone it is stuck on the 'Connect to iTunes' screen (iTunes logo with a USB cord). My phone is still stuck on that and when I try to fix it with iTunes with my PC (Windows 7) the message always pops up saying that my phone needs to restore. Can you help me with this?\n\nA: When your phone gets stuck trying to update, it usually means it has way too much data in it. For a good average update that's takes at least 20 mins, you'll need to have at least 2.5 GB. Your phone has gotten stuck because it had way too much stuff in it, and it can't continue. \nMy solution: restore the phone. There is way too much data inside,and it will stay that way unless something happens. This can be a good and bad thing. If you had some stuff on iCloud or some storage, you just might restore your apps and everything else. But if you don't, let's just hope you had nothing important in the phone, because it might just go down the drain. Besides you are left with no other option, right?\nI hope this helps. If you find a better way, please use that way instead of this way. I hope you are able to fix your phone.\n\nA: The best way to solve this is to actually restore your iPhone.\n", "Q: Disabling the iPhoto Photo Stream App badge icon without disabling shared streams? When I have new photos available in my shared photo streams, the iPhoto icon in the dock has a red circle with a number in it, also known as a \"Badge App Icon\".\nI went to System Preferences -> Notifications -> Photo Stream and disabled everything, but the badge app icon on iPhoto still shows.\nFor now I have disabled shared photo streams completely from iPhoto -> Preferences, and that has removed the badge app icon, but I would prefer to still keep it enabled.\nHow can I disable this badge app icon?\n\nA: I got rid of the red circle number (the notification), by going to \nsystem preferences ➔ iCloud ➞ and then unchecking the box to the left of \"Photos\"   When you re-check the checkbox, the notifications will briefly display in the upper right part of the screen, telling you about photo stream invitations you have received from other people. \n\nA: You can disable the badge on the Photos app icon in Notification Center settings. Go to System Preferences → Notifications → iPhoto → Badge App Icon and uncheck the box.\n\nI don't have iPhoto on my system, so replace iCloud Photos with iPhoto.\n", "Q: What iPad app can I use to manage the locations where I took some photos?

Also i would like to have my bookmarks from chrome.\nI have the old HD in a case so i can plug it in and use it as an external harddrive.\nI tryed just copying the whole Library Folder - didn't work.\nAny Ideas anyone?\n\nA: Though not a selective copy, you could use Migration Assistant (under /Applications/Utilities) to copy your entire user data from the older hard drive to the Mac. Turn off Time Machine before doing this (to avoid unnecessary backups and slowing down the migration).\nSince you already have the user account and Migration Assistant has created a second account, there is no simple way to merge the two accounts (definitely not the configuration used by various applications and the data, since there may be conflicts). But you can copy over data across from the individual folders under the home directory (and somewhat tediously, application data on an application-by-application basis).\nSee:\nHow to use Migration Assistant to transfer files from another Mac\nUsing Migration Assistant on Lion\nCombine two+ Users Accounts on the same machine\nTransferring files from one User Account to another \n\nA: This may be too late to say this but you could have used SuperDuper! or CarbonCopyCloner to move the contents of a case-sensitive backup to a case-insensitive harddrive. (Or alternatively iPartition.) And then have installed Lion which should migrate user preferences as part of the installation process.\n\nA: Mail keeps message data in a folder, and mail account settings in a .plist file.\nSupposing you know how to access the user's Library folder, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the Mail folder (located in ~/Library/Preferences/) from the old Mac to the new one.\n\n*Copy the following file from the old Mac to the new one:\nMountain Lion or newer:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist\n\nLion:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist\n\nThe procedure works best if you haven't tried to open Mail before. In case you did, as you try and copy the configuration file or document folder, OS X will ask you if you want to keep the old file, the new one or both.\nAbout calendars (and notes and contacts, and possibly Chrome bookmarks), I'd suggest syncing via iCloud and Google respectively. The offline procedures are comparatively too complicated to be worth the hassle, and since you use Chrome, I suppose you have access to an internet connection. You can boot from the old disk (installed in a HD case compatible with one of your Mac's expansion ports) for syncing.\niPhoto Library is in ~/Pictures/iPhoto Library\n\nA: I'd like to add that if you have IMAP Email (Gmail, or Domain Email setup as IMAP) your Folders will be imported when you setup your Email Account on the New Solid-State Drive. If you are using POP (Post-Office Protocol) Email, then please follow okami's instructions above. Although, in some cases, setting-up a POP Email Address on a Desktop Mail Client can download every email since the account was created. (Meaning, you will have to Mark As Read many messages that you've already seen. But at least you have them all, locally.) WebMail is another Option, as is Online Bookmarks (Delicious.com) and Online Calendar (Google Calendar, etc). If everything is Online, or Synced through iCloud, you can move from Computer-to-Computer and have all of your information Synced Automatically. iCloud is Free for 5GB of Storage.\n", "Q: iOS 7 music controls not working As soon as I updated my phone, my music controls stopped working.

I have to go into the Music app to change the song every time. My screen isn't cracked or broken - it works perfectly fine. Please could I have some help on what to do?\n\nA: Try resetting your phone I was having the same problem, make sure to close ever app before turning your phone off. It's working for me at the moment but I've been having this problem since iOS 6 and also in iOS 7 now, so who knows how long it'll work. \n\nA: Had the same issue with my 4S and tried turning my phone (all the way) off (by holding down the power button for 6 seconds …) and on (ditto) and it fixed the problem.  I did NOT have to quit my apps. (A good thing since that's done differently in IOS 7 … with swipe(s))\nIt happened right after I updated the OS to 7.0.2; perhaps that's true for others affected by this.\n\nA: Have same issue on my iPhone 4, went to settings and deactivated the control center access while locked, closed settings completely and turned off my cellphone.

I'd like to be able to AirDrop files between my Mac and my iPhone, but it seems that iOS devices don't show up on the Mac AirDrop console.\nIs it possible to use AirDrop to transfer files between a Mac and an iOS7 device? Is there, say, a file-manager app I can install that makes it possible?\n\nA: Not Yet, I have tested it and TechHive confirms. Though Mavericks may bring this functionality (complete speculation obviously).\n\nA: With iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite, you can share files over AirDrop between Mac and iOS.\n\nImage source: http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/finally-airdrop-works-between-ios-and-mac/\n", "Q: Is there a complete list of iTunes Radio Featured Stations? iTunes Radio shows featured stations at the top of iTunes Radio. These are regularly updated and thus 'bumping' older featured stations. Some of these stations can still be accessed through the add station button.

Is there maybe a log somewhere I could look at?\n\nA: I have found that importing songs with ampersands and commas in their title or album name can cause problems.  I haven't found a workaround, but exporting the library to a text file and then searching the proper columns might help identify the missing files.\n", "Q: How do I run Mac OS X partition on Windows 7 through a virtual machine? On my Mac Pro I'm running Mountain Lion. With OS X I can run my Windows 7 partition using VMWare. Is it possible to run my Mac OS X partition in Windows 7 running VMWare or any other virtual machine application out there? If so, could someone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: Here is a quick summary of running OS X on non apple hardware with (and also without) support from virtualization such as VMware. \n\n\n*\n\n*Possible - yes\n\n*Supported, licensed, intended - no\n\n*Legal - you'll need a lawyer to help with that in your specific location.\nSo, as long as the hardware was Mac you would be probably licensed for Lion and later OS X to run visually no matter what intermediary OS you used as part of the virtualization chain. The how isn't going to be easy since you'll have to defeat either VMWare's checks to prevent any Windows person from running OS X or OS X's checks to ensure it's running on Mac hardware.\n\nA: Several versions of VMware and VirtualBox support installing Mac OS, but it doesn't work very fluent due to the lack of \"QE/CI\", which is a technology to accelerate graphics (for e.g. you wont have the transparent bar at the top and the cursor will probably be a bit laggy).\nHowever according to Apple's license agreement you're only allowed to install Mac on Apple hardware. As long as your Windows 7 runs on a Mac and from within this Windows you install Mac OS it's ok (I know from VMware ESXi that it checks if it is running on Apple hardware otherwise you won't be able to install Mac OS in a virtual machine).\n", "Q: Force Mail.app to show manual configuration options Now that Outlook.com supports IMAP email I'd like to set up Mail.app (on OS X 10.7.5) to use it rather than POP for that account. I have it set up on my Windows and Android machines, so I know it works. \nThe issue is that Mail's auto configuration only detects the POP servers when I try to add a new account, and there are no manual configuration options to set up the IMAP details. Is there any way to add an account and show the necessary configuration options? \n\nA: tl;dr - Enter an incorrect password when setting up the account for the first time\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail → Accounts….\n\n*Click the + to add an account.\n\n\n*Select Add Other Mail Account… and click Continue.\n\n\n*When the password is required, enter an incorrect password.\n\n\n*It will request that the account be configured manually.\n\n\n*Follow the instructions to add your mail configuration.\n\n\nA: Note: Possibly only relevant in Lion, Mail.app v.5.3\nTurns out it's bypassable if you hold alt down. The \"Create\" button then changes to \"Continue\".\nNot entirely on-topic protip: alt often changes the behavior of buttons to allow \"power-users\" to actually get things done which lusers probably shouldn't be bothered with.

When I long press on a photo someone shared with me in an iMessage chat I get three main options: Copy, More..., and Speak.

In iOS 6 and 7 there's a section in the Photos app that allows you to share photos with other people and other people to share photos with you. \n\n\n*\n\n*When others share with me, are the photos copied to my harddrive? Or do they purely reside in the cloud?\n\n*If I add the same photo to two different streams, will it duplicate the amount of space used on my phone? Or does Apple intelligently make a reference link instead of a copy? \n\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*When others share with me, are the photos copied to my hard drive? Or do they purely reside in the cloud?\n  \n\nPhotos shared with you (or photos you share) get copied to your (or others') devices through iCloud. They reside on iCloud for just 30 days to give adequate time for all devices to sync them from the cloud. See iCloud: My Photo Stream FAQ\n\n  \n*\n  \n*If I add the same photo to two different streams, will it duplicate the amount of space used on my phone? Or does Apple intelligently make a reference link instead of a copy?\n  \n\nIt won't add another copy on your phone across your photo streams, but there will be a photo stream specific copy that's separate from the camera roll (and any other albums the photo may be part of).\nThe quality of the photos shared will also vary across devices. See iCloud Photo Stream and Image Quality\n\nThere are three groups you see under Settings > General > Usage > Photos & Camera:\n\n\n*\n\n*Camera Roll - this is for photos you have taken on the device as well as photos you have saved to the Camera Roll from (others') photo streams you have subscribed to. If you have Photo Stream enabled, any photo you take with your camera will be added to the Camera Roll and Photo Stream (with Photo Stream being restricted to the recent 1000 photos on iOS devices; there are no restrictions on photo streams on computers).\n\n*Photo Library - this is for photos that have been synced from iTunes (the source of those usually being iPhoto or Aperture on OS X).\n\n*Photo Stream - this is for photos from your and others' photo streams. If you delete a photo from your photo stream, it will get deleted from all other devices that sync to the same iCloud account.\n\n\nA: As of my experience the whole Photostream feature needs about 1GB of space on your iOS device.\nWhen I reinstalled my iPhone recently and haven't taken any photo yet - iTunes showed up a usage of ≈1.1GB for photos, just because I had the Photostream activated.\nThe interesting thing is, that I had many photos in my Photostream, that were made with my DSLR and synced into the Photostream via iPad. All of these ≈600 Photos would have used a lot more that these 1.1GB, so I guess you get a smaller version of your photos for your iPhone. However you get the pictures in full-size in iPhoto on a Mac.\n\nA: Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage > Photos & Camera > Shared Photo Stream\n\nShows 15.1 MB for me, and I'm in a shared stream between  many people and thousands of photos\niOSv8.1\n\nA: The answer is wrong: \"Photos shared with you (or photos you share) get copied to your (or others') devices through iCloud. They reside on iCloud for just 30 days to give adequate time for all devices to sync them from the cloud.\"\nThe 30 day limit is only for \"My Photo Streaming\", not for \"iCloud photo sharing\".

We have a playlist each that we sync to our various devices.\nSince iOS7, all the music I've ever purchased from iTunes is now on my phone, not just my single playlist.\nThat wouldn't be so bad if the purchased music wasn't dominated by all the rubbish that I've bought for my kids.\nI think it's just streaming, but it's still really annoying because my car shuffles between all the songs on the device by default.\nEdit: Daryl's suggestion to turn off \"Show All Music\" in Settings got rid of all the purchased songs I hadn't played.  Ones I was foolish enough to play remain firmly stuck on the phone.\nFurthermore, these songs cannot be deleted by swiping left to reveal a delete button.\n\nA: I had the same exact problem. Ended up being that the song had not cpletely finished being downloaded to the phone, so it could be deleted. Go into settings and tell it to display all music again. Then go back to each song and click the cloud icon to download again. After each song downloads you will have the ability to swipe and delete, just like all of your other songs. I'm running ios7 too, so I'm sure this is your problem too. \n\nA: iPhones can’t stream music directly from iCloud, therefore all music you at some point played on your iPhone has been downloaded to your iPhone.\nIn order to delete a track, you can go into the song view and swipe the song to the left – a Delete button should appear, allowing you to delete the track from your phone.\n\nA: One tip that has not been shown in answers thus far is to restart the music app after making the changes to settings.  It seems that some residual setting is keeping  your music visible and not allowing your settings to be used properly.  Please check out the link here which pretty much summarises the same steps as answers already provided, but with pics, and shows where and how to restart the Music app.  Also note, that the steps to swipe to delete the music need to be made while the show all music option is enabled, then you can disable it after you have removed them.\n\nA: You can always go to General Settings->Usage->Music delete all music from your phone from there and then re-sync only your playlist. After that disable the show all music setting and it should be fine.\nAre you an iTunes match subscriber? If yes then in order to delete individual songs you also have to disable it first. Note that songs that you have listened through download but not explicitly downloaded (they still show a cloud button when show all music is enabled) are un-deletable (but will go away if you scrap the whole library).\n\nA: Go to General>Music.  Uncheck the \"Show All Music\" option\n\n", "Q: Can I use Airport Express to repeat wifi without physical access to the router? I have a wireless network name and its password. I can connect to this Wi-Fi network with my computer.\nIf I have an Airport Express, can I configure it to repeat the signal without physical access to the router?\n\nA: Your Airport Express will only work as a wireless extender/booster if your main access point is an Apple Router, like another Express or an Extreme or Time Capsule. \nHowever the way around this for a non-Apple router is if you hard-wire it (run an Ethernet cable straight from your modem or router to the Airport Express). \nThis might be not applicable to your situation since you do not have physical access to the router.\nThere are other (more universal) Extenders on the market, for example from Netgear (for about $50). I use one, and it works like charm in extending existing wifi network that I do not have physical access to.\n", "Q: Why do OTA updates require so much space? Why do OTA updates for iOS always require at least 3GB of free space? It's kind of a pain to have to delete apps and then to have to reinstall them again.\n\nA: The old OS has to run until the new one is in place and ready for the device to restart. Right there, you have 2x the space of a generic OS image.\nThen, the OTA updates take more space than iTunes with a computer assisting  since your iPhone must have space not only for the compressed image, but also to store uncompressed contents of that download.\nLastly, some amount of temporary space is needed as it actually installs the updated firmware. This space is for upgrade scripts, patching settings, upgrading databases and getting all the old content ready for the new code.\nHere's an accounting of the current fall 2013 upgrade with specifics. iOS 6 took up something like 600MB of space, but required something closer to 2.5GB of free space for the OTA update download/installation process, so it should be no surprise that iOS 7 asks for 3 GB space.\nHere is a related link that may contain additional information.\n\nA: When you download OS updates over the air, the update package is usually compressed to save you and the update server bandwidth. Once the download is completed, your device needs to extract the contents of the compressed package in order for the OS to install the update. Thus, it requires that extra space for this step.\n", "Q: Clean iPhone - clean up \n*\n\n*I have iPhone with ios6 is it possible to clean all the data under\n/Application without jailbreaking it?\n\n*How can I clean and make more free room on my iPhone?\n\n\nA: I'm not sure what you mean by /Applications in the context you're using it. Each app has its own directory structure and the developer decides how to best organize that data. For example, some use libraries and others, documents. \nThat said, what you can do to release space, are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the app from the device. That will delete its data. Then restore the app from iTunes, or the cloud.\n\n*Use something like iExplorer or Phone Disk, that lets you access and/or mount the device as if it were an external hard drive. Then, you had better be most careful, as you can likely kill some apps if you delete the wrong files.\n\nA: Check out iClean - it forces the OS to empty all cached and temp files.\n", "Q: Why is Netflix more effecient in Safari than Firefox? I've noticed that when I play Netflix video in Firefox, my Macbook Air's fans spin up to maximum, but under Safari, it stays silent. Why does Safari cause less of a load?\n\nA: Please see Toms Hardware Benchmark.  This could help explain comparable efficiency between Safari and Firefox.  I have no proof, but a Apple Genius has also told me Firefox is less efficient compared to Safari and Chrome.\n", "Q: What would cause a MacBook to restart instead of shutting down or sleeping? I know there's a lot of advice for MacBooks randomly shutting down or restarting, but my question is a bit different. My MacBook Pro (mid-2010 15\") only turns off when I instruct it to. However, it will only ever Restart: If \"Shutdown\" is chosen, it will instead restart. If \"Sleep\" is chosen, it will restart. If I close the lid and the computer tries to go to sleep, it will restart. The only way to get it to power off is by manually holding the power button. \nThe issue began when I updated to 10.8.4 so I assume it's some sort of software problem with the OS (could a .plist file have been changed somewhere with a bizarre value?). I was hoping that upgrading to 10.8.5 might help, but it's impossible to update because...the computer reset required prohibits the update from happening. \nI've also checked the kernel's shutdown causes, and it's typically code \"3\" or \"-60\" I know there's no guide to what these mean, but I'm guessing they refer to the system restarting on its own (\"3\") and being turned off manually by the user (\"-60\") but I have nothing to back that up.\nWhat might cause a Mac to display this behavior?\n\nA: Have you tried resetting the PRAM?\nDo it from Open Firmware - as your Mac restarts hold ⌘ + OF \nwhen you get to the prompt type\n\nreset-nvram\n  Press Return\n  reset-all\n  Press Return\n\nit might work\n\nA: Now there is a \"Macbook EFI Firmware Update\" available that fixes this problem. It should show up when you click on \"Software Update...\" under the Apple menu.\n", "Q: How to install OS X Mountain Lion without an Internet connection I wish to upgrade my MacBook Pro's hard disk to Solid State Drive, and that requires an installation of OS X on the SSD drive before I can replace the hard drive. \nThe typical installation instructions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable partition on the SSD\n\n*Hook up the SSD via an external adapter (for example, USB), boot up the MacBook Pro and start the recovery process. \n\n*Select the SSD drive as the drive for OS X to be installed. \n\n*Agree to the license agreement, log on using Apple ID (if required) and let \"Install OS X\" app download a copy of the OS over the Internet before installing it to the SSD\netc, etc, etc\n\n\nThe issue is without a very fast Internet connection, the installation process will take a very long time. \nAre there any alternatives such as pre-downloading a copy of OS X, or cloning the content of the drive?\n\nA: You can use Lion DiskMaker (which works for Mountain Lion as well) to make a bootable USB stick. This requires downloading the Mountain Lion installer, and a USB stick larger than 8GB. You can also burn a single layer DVD of the installer if you so desire (and, obviously, if you have an optical drive)\n", "Q: How can I change the Glossed app icon? Before iOS 7 on the iPhone, there was an option in settings to turn off the gloss on apps, how can I do so on iOS 7?\n\nA: If you're talking about the icons on your home screen, as a user there is no option to remove the gloss. This is a developer feature. As a developer you uploaded a raw icon and (by default) apple would add the gloss. You could turn this off if you wanted to add your own gloss (to add your own other effects), or if you just didn't want the gloss at all. \nI've noticed that since going to iOS7, that MOST of the apps that had gloss, no longer do have gloss, but the occasional one does. This is obviously because the developer chose to add the gloss themselves and set the flag to have apple NOT add it. In this case, apple can't remove it.\nSeems like apple thought ahead in this regard and it was simply a matter of turning this off to remove all glossed effects to match their new iOS. \nHowever, in the case that any developer added it manually, there will be no way for you to remove it short of changing the icon which just isn't possible.\n", "Q: iMessages showing up as seperate user when coming from Mac vs iPhone I have a Mac running Mountain Lion and an iPhone5 running iOS7\nI have confirmed that the Apple account setup in messages in my Mac and iPhone are the same account.\nHowever when I send a message to my wife's iPhone from my Mac it shows up as a separate thread (same name) than when I send a message from my iPhone. She will have 2 threads on her phone, when she responds to the thread started from the Mac, only my Mac will receive the message. When she responds to threads sent from my iPhone, only my iPhone receives the messages.\nIt like iMessage on my Mac vs iPhone are acting like 2 separate accounts even though they are both using the same Apple ID.\nIs there anyway I can resolve this?\nI tried followed the instructions here but there was no setting titled Use your Apple ID for iMessage. The settings may have changed since the last version of iOS I am guessing.\n\nA: When I went to Preferences > Accounts within Messages on my Mac under:\n\nYou can be reached for messages at:\n\nIt was only listing my email address (no phone number).\nLogging out and back into Messages on my Mac, caused the phone number to show up here.

I'm generally happy with it but some applications require a more recent iOS version. So I started to look into upgrading it, but the only upgrade that it offers is to iOS 7.\nFrom the look of it I don't like the new design of iOS 7 too much and also upgrading to a version this fresh doesn't appeal to me. So my question is: is there a way to upgrade to some version of iOS 5.x or iOS 6.x instead of upgrading to iOS 7? \n\nA: Currently, no, your only option is to upgrade to iOS 7. This is because Apple is no longer signing iOS 6 and the firmware signing status for iPad 2 shows iOS 7 as the only signed version.\n\nNote: Lookup the signing status (or get the direct download links) for all iOS versions here.\n\nA: You probably want to check out this website, which has all past iOS updates. Scroll down and click the iPad 2 model you have (Wifi, GSM, CDMA). Then, simply choose the iOS you want (probably 6.1.3). It will download an .ipsw file.\n\nThen, in iTunes, plug in your iPad. Now, here's the important part: Press Option/Shift while clicking the Check for Update button. A dialog box should open up, and you should navigate to the .ipsw file and then click it. Similarly, if, for some reason, you want to restore your iPad and update, press Option/Shift while clicking the Restore button.\n", "Q: Secure Empty Trash can't count? On the few occasions I've tried using secure empty trash, it takes forever (I hear this is normal) but when it's in progress it counts the number of items to delete incorrectly.  I put one file in the trash, secure empty it, and it shows a progress bar stating that 5 items still need to be deleted.  It was a large file, so maybe it's split into 5 parts?  Or are there some other hidden files associated with my file that are being deleted as well?  \n\nA: Secure emptying takes long because instead of marking the areas of your disk which stored the files you're deleting as \"available\", it overwrites them with junk in order to make difficult recovering those data.\nWhat you say happens to me too, I think it's pretty normal. i.e. it could be deleting .DS_Stores when you delete a directory.\n", "Q: Upgrade iPad2 to previous iOS version (from 4 to 6, but not 7) I have an iPad2 with original iOS4.3.3, no jailbreak. Now there are several apps that require iOS 5 or above and I'm ready to upgrade. But I don't want to install yet the latest iOS7 (heard about some bugs, performance issues, etc.).\nI backed up all the data and apps with iTunes (11.1) on Mac computer. But in iTunes I have only iOS7 as the option to upgrade. It's a pity I'm just a few weeks late, when this new os became available.\nI've tried hard to google it, but all the links discusses just upgrade to iOS7.\nIs there any way to upgrade to previous iOS6 now? Better without jailbreak, but if there will be no other choice I may consider ... \n\nA: For security reasons, once a new update is released the old ones are no longer supported, so there is no way to upgrade to six or seven.\nHowever, there is no issue upgrading to iOS 7, because the interface is slicker and prettier, and it utilizes the iPad's resources well. \n", "Q: Why can't Preview export some TIFFs to PNG? Some TIFFs can't be exported to PNG in Preview. What is preventing this and how do I correct it?\n\nA: This happens when the image is in CMYK. \nPNG does not support the CMYK color mode therefore Preview won't suggest it for the export. \n", "Q: How do I correct the iOS7 photo app's location guess? iOS7 organizes photos into automatic groups. It labels each group with a location. It often chooses the wrong location.\nFor example if you're at the supermarket it might say \"Anytown Post Office\" if there happens to be a post office near by\nHow do I correct it with the correct location? In the example above I want the group labeled \"Supermarket\" instead of \"Post Office\"\n\nA: You can edit this in iPhoto on your mac, but only on the local copy not the Photo Stream copy. On the iPhone you'd want to get a metadata editor app such as EXIF-fi ($.99)\n", "Q: AppStore gambling policy As I understand currently Apple allows some kind of gambling apps to be published on AppStore, I just don't know all about this. So, my question is if they would allow a lotto type app with real money of course but also with virtual currency.\nIf anyone could shed some light on this I would be thankful.\n\nA: Apples publishes the objective and subjective app review criteria publicly at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/appstore/guidelines.html\nI see nothing that currently prohibits gambling apps.

(connecting screen 2 to screen 1 and screen 1 to the MBPR).\nThose screens all work fine, but the color calibration is a big question mark.\nWhile the screen 2 is showing a clear white, screen 1 is having this yellowish white which I dont really like. How can I fix that? Color profiles in the System Preferences → Displays seem to me that I can only calibrate screen 2…\n\nA: I have fixed the problem. What I did is: under System Preference - > Displays go to Color Tab. I calibrated both the displays differently to match color with each other. \n", "Q: Upgrade OS X Lion (10.7.4) to OS X Mountain Lion I have OS X Lion 10.7.4 and want to upgrade OS X Mountain Lion. \n\n\n*\n\n*What do I have to do for the upgrade?\n\n*Do I have to backup my system? If yes, which program can I use for the backup?\n\n*If I have any problems with the install, can I restore it from the backup?\n\n\nA: Actually this is pretty simple.\nThough you can install Mountain Lion right over (upgrade) Lion without doing any backups at all a more prudent method would be to backup first.\nTo back up your computer you will need an external hard drive (USB, Firewire, or Thunderbolt. USB would likely be cheaper but a bit slower) that is a little bigger than the HD that you are upgrading.\nIf you plug the USB drive into your Mac, Time Machine will automatically ask you if you want to use it as a backup drive (not sure about the actual wording...) You can allow Time Machine to proceed and back up your whole computer. Once it is done, un plug it and proceed with the upgrade.\nAlternatively you could use a commercial backup program to do the same thing. I have used both Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper to make backups of my drives. Bot work really well and are not expensive. The advantage with these is that they make a BOOTABLE backup image of your hard drive, where Time Machine will need you to install the O/S to then do a restore of your data.\nOnce you have made your backup (and tested it by checking a number of files or booting from the backup and verifying it all works) just go to the App Store (in your Apple Menu) and purchase Mountain Lion. It's a BIG download (4+ GB) and will take a while, when done it will automatically prompt you to start the installation. Just follow the prompts. Your Mac will reboot and proceed with the upgrade. It is likely that you will not need your backup as these upgrades usually go quite well.\nThere are some caveats. If you have modified your O/S or used applications that make changes to the O/S you might want to remove them before upgrading. You may also want to check that the versions of any applications you installed are compatible with Mountain Lion. That info will be on the manufacturers website. Basically you need to be aware that it is possible that something that worked fine under Lion will NOT work under Mountain Lion. Only you can make that determination.\nSome people take the pre-install procedure a bit farther than just a backup. It is not uncommon to boot your Mac from the original install media and run disk utility and run a \"repair disk\" and \"repair permissions\" on it before installing. You could also use a maintenance tool like Onyx to do some basic repairs and maintenance on your system before upgrading as well. Some people won't upgrade before doing either or both of this things, some people just download and install the new O/S with no special prep or backup.\nReally it's your choice.\n", "Q: Lost sender's name in my received emails. I recently uploaded IOS7 onto my iPhone 4S and now I can't see the name of the sender of any newly received emails in my inbox. Can anyone help?  Nothing too techy please - plain English needed.

Is it possible to do something like the concept of sandboxing (like all apps on iOS have its own system software resources) for all existing applications (so - not while designing an own new application) on OSX (Lion/ML/Maverics) just copying required frameworks, libraries, binaries (/usr, /etc, /Library, etc.) and than using chroot for the process when start?\n\nA: Of course this is possible - iOS sandboxes all applications by default and runs on the same Darwin core as OS X. Apple hasn't chosen to implement this on OS X, so you would have a lot of engineering work to bolt this extra security on top of OS X. In the short run, it might be easier to virtualize the OS if you only need to sandbox one or two applications. \n", "Q: Why do I have to \"renew Touch ID purchases\" all the time? I have an iPhone 5S, and I have automatic app updates disabled as I like to manage these myself. However, when I do, I have to enter my Apple ID password every time?\nIf I make new purchases, it seems to go through with the Touch ID; however, if I update an app I am forced to manually enter my password.\nI have the 7.0.1 update and apple store purchases under the General => Fingerprint section in Settings, which is turned on.\nI have searched the apple discussion forums and the common answer seems to be the update. It's not that.\nSo short question is, why do I have to actually \"Confirm Apple ID password for  to renew Touch ID purchases\" all the time? \nHow can I have it use TouchID as I have it set in the settings?\n\nA: Security, if someone else puts his finger into touch ID, he could purchase everything. Or if someone logs in with his apple id on your phone, you could just buy things without knowing his password.\nTouch ID isn't linked to your Apple ID, but to your phone\n\nA: Prior to the launch of the iPhone 5s, I went on record on the iMore Show with my one desire for the then much rumored fingerprint sensor. If it arrived and didn't allow me to buy apps and content from iTunes by touching my finger to it, then I wasn't that interested. Delight then, that Apple took the stage, announced Touch ID, and that we could use it to buy things. Delight, quickly followed by epic frustration.\nWhy frustration? Because I still find myself entering my Apple ID password at present twice a day, minimum. I'm referring to a message which pops up just after hitting the install button on a new app from the App Store. It says;\nConfirm Apple ID Password for \".........\" to Renew Touch ID Purchases\nThe only instance I've come across elsewhere on the iPhone 5s that specifically requests passcode input over Touch ID is when you restart the device. That's understandable, but it also doesn't require entering a 20+ character password. I have a long and complex Apple ID password – as should everyone else – which is precisely why I was so excited when Apple announced Touch ID support for the stores. I'm lazy. And entering a 20+ character password every time you want to download an app gets tiresome.\n", "Q: How to recover from \"chown -R $USER /usr/\"?

If you only used /usr/local/ with Homebrew, you might delete /usr/local/ and then reinstall Homebrew.\nAlternatively, you could use Pacifist to copy the default /usr/ from an OS X installer downloaded from App Store. Doing an upgrade install of OS X from the recovery partition or upgrading to 10.9 might also restore the owners of some files.\n\nA: I think this is a case where Repair Permissions actually does something useful. It will restore the correct permissions to all the files supplied by Apple which I think is all but those in /usr/local  That directory contains stuff you added and so you should be able to recreate.\nTo Repair Permissions Use Disk Utility.app and select the boot disk inthe left hand list of disks.

I got as far as this question where my issue came up only as a comment. \n\nI've heard and deleted the 9/6 and 9/13 episodes, but they appear in the list. \nA right-click (sorry yes I'm on a Mac but have a mouse with r-c) shows no delete option.\nSo, when looking at my list of podcasts, I'm potentially looking at hundreds of podcasts that aren't current, I have a few that are daily, and they now show 100+ of old episodes. Any podcast fans have this issue and way to fix this? \nNote, I checked the source folder for the podcast title, and this are not there, not taking HD space, just space on this list. Last - I know there's a n option to limit the number shown, but there are some shows that I'd want o keep more than this limit. If I am away from iTunes for a while, I still want the dailies available. \n\nNote - it's all podcasts that have this issue, th image is to show one example, but they all have a long list of old shows. \n10/4/13 update from the notes on 11.1.11 update :\n\nThis update resolves an issue that may cause iTunes Extras to display\n  incorrectly, fixes a problem with deleted podcasts, and improves\n  stability.\n\nAnd after updating, the issue is gone. Which, of course, renders this thread delete-worthy. Thank you for the comments and support!\n\nA: I can't add a simple comment as I don't have the rep, but I'd like to add something to this discussion:\n\n\n*\n\n*In 11.1 you can delete downloaded podcasts just like always. The difference is that, while the file will disappear from your HD, the listing for that file will still be presented to you in itunes. The listings are not deletable (currently). This is causing confusion because, formerly, deleting the file would also automatically delete the listing. Note that I'm assuming that's why bmike was able to display the delete box above--he was deleting an existing file from his HD.\n\n*This has happened before. Apple just doesn't seem to test (or really understand--see the new 'podcast' app) podcast user behavior. Thus every once in a while itunes gets updated and you get a bug like this one.\n\n*This is a BUG not a purposeful change. There are podcasts that create a dozen files to download per day, normally I could just click the download all button and get them all at once. But because now I cannot remove old, already discarded podcasts from the list, the download all button will download... hundreds of files. It's not logical that this would be considered a feature. It's a bug, which they've had before, and they've fixed before.\nIt'll get fixed, but as I recall it took a month or so last time... sorry folks, and welcome to the Apple way!\nEdit:\njust to prove without a doubt that this is a bug, note that there is still a selection when you right click on a podcast 'show old episodes'. This setting used to re-query the rss feed and list out all the available podcasts so that you could download them. This was needed because, as discussed, when you deleted a local file, the listing for it also was removed. The way 11.1 works now is similar to if the 'show old episodes' button was perpetually set 'on', with no way to turn it off. Thus, either this behavior (not being able to delete podcast listings) is a bug, or the continued presence of the 'show old episodes' button is a bug.\nOne of them is a bug, I'm guessing it's this new behavior, not the presence of the seemingly-redundant 'show old episodes' button.\nHTH! Have patience and it'll get fixed :)\n\nA: Podcast listings are glorified RSS feeds with local cached content.\nOn iTunes 11.1, you can't hide or change the individual episodes that make up a podcast listing other an by deleting that entire feed from your list of podcasts. This simplifies the code, simplifies the states a podcast can be in, but aggravates anyone who used to like to curate their version of the RSS feed.\n\nAs to controlling the downloaded titles,  you can still hilight any episode and press the delete key to delete all selected episodes.\n\nYour \"continuous\" indication is an odd marking and probably the result of a malformed stream from the podcast server or other odd state that the database file that tracks iTunes podcasts. You might need to delete any downloaded podcasts you wish to keep (rescuing them from the trash if you move them there) and then unsubscribe from that podcast.\nOnce the history of plays is clear, you might attempt to delete any remaining entries and then re-subscribe. At that point, you could adjust the auto delete settings for that podcast, refresh the episode list and manually re-import the shows you had saved above.\n", "Q: Boot Camp Assistant: \"Your disk could not be restored to a single partition.\" I want to delete my Windows partition and regrow my Mac partition to use the whole disk.

This may have been in part due to the fact the amount I initially partition for Bootcamp wasn't  sufficient, so decreased the Mac partition and then use Mini-Tool Partition on Windows side to extend my Bootcamp partition.  \nInstead I used Disk Utility to erase the unwanted partition, and then I was able to restore it through the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\nA: Just restarting and trying again solved the problem for me. \n\nA: I fixed it in 10.11.1 El Capitan by formatting the Bootcamp Partition several times to FAT formatting. Then going back into Bootcamp Assistant and telling it to once again restore the original boot partition to size. This then asked to adjust my settings for Bootcamp 4 times. I said yes each time. This removed the Bootcamp partition completely for good.\n\nA: Disk Utility > view > show all\nSelect the main disk > erase > format using 'partition choice' and good to go. \n", "Q: International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) dictionary guide in OS7 How do I change the settings to display the in the dictionary the IPA pronunciation guide, rather than diacritical, guide in the iPhone 5S iOS 7?\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way change the dictionary to IPA or download custom dictionaries to iOS (save for jailbreaking it). However...\nThis isn't a complete solution, but if you hit \"Manage\" and download \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" it will give you an English dictionary with IPA pronunciation. The only caveat is that it will be British English pronunciation.\nWhich depending on your use may or may not be useful since it will depend heavily on the particular word defined and your own dialect. For instance, the word \"solution\" in American English is usually pronounced something like suh-loo-shun while British English would pronounce it more like sull-yoo-shun (pardon my bad almost-diacritics), which can throw you off if you are using it to learn or reinforce already learnt IPA.\n", "Q: Where is java?

I have a very weird problem - I messed up with the partions when I installed Bootcamp. \nI want to upgrade my 10.7.5 to 10.8.5. I have bought the 10.8.5 from Apple Store. I downloaded it and when tried installing it, it failed because there was no Apple-formatted disk.\nSo I guess I have to reformat the whole drive. I have backed up all my data (I don't have enough hard drive space to make a Time Machine backup). I have just saved necessary files and also the installer for OS X 10.8.5 that I just downloaded from Apple.\nNow, how can I reformat and install OS X from the installer placed in the external hard drive?\n\nA: You don't need any external drive. You can erase the drive and reinstall OS X using the recovery system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up from the recovery partition by holding command-R.\n\n*Open Disk Utility, select the drive (not the Macintosh HD volume), open the erase tab, set the format to Mac OS Extended (Journaled), and press the erase button. It also erases the hidden recovery and EFI partitions.\n\n*Reinstall OS X. When I did this with my MacBook Air, I restarted it after I had erased the drive, so I don't know if it is possible to reinstall OS X from the recovery partition without relying on Internet Recovery mode. But if you restart the Mac, it will start up in Internet Recovery mode, which means that it downloads a disk image of the recovery system from Apple's servers, and you can then install OS X on the empty drive.\n\n\nSome older Macs support a recovery partition but not Internet Recovery mode. See http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4904. If you have one of those Macs, you erase the whole drive from the recovery partition, and it is not in fact possible to reinstall OS X without starting up in Internet Recovery mode after that, you can probably use Recovery Disk Assistant instead.\nIf others search for how to do a normal erase and reinstall, erase the main OS X partition (like Macintosh HD) instead of the whole drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up from the recovery partition by holding command-R.\n\n*Open Disk Utility, select the Macintosh HD volume, open the erase tab, and press the erase button.\n\n*Quit Disk Utility and choose Install OS X.\n\n\nSee https://support.apple.com/kb/ph11273.\nIf your Mac came with Lion, the Install OS X option will download and install the latest minor version of Lion. You can upgrade to Mountain Lion or Mavericks from App Store after that.\n\nA: If your machine is still useable and can boot to mac OS, you can create a bootable usb drive out of the image using the links from below and then proceed with the install from the drive.\nIn case you can't boot to Mac you can still take help from a friend who has a Mac with the procedure.\nIf you have messed with the partitions you will probably have to erase the drive and recreate the partitions.

On my iPhone with iOS 6, I often use the Amazon bluetooth keyboard to use my iPhone, including turning it on (home button on keyboard) and unlocking (escape button instead of swiping to unlock). But (and I don't remember how this was on iOS 6) with my iPad on iOS 7, the iPad won't respond to the keyboard when the screen is off (can't access lock screen) and the \"escape\" button doesn't reveal the home screen.

See screenshots:\n\n\n\nHow can I get the correct badge count? It bothers me that the App Store says there are new updates, while there aren't.\niOS 6.1.3 / iPhone 4s\n\nA: Thanks, bmike, for the theory. It allowed me to find at least one practical solution.\nGo into the App Store. Select Purchased → All. Now carefully scroll down the list. You will find one or more apps with a status of Install instead of Open. Go ahead and install them. If you have not upgraded to iOS 7 you may get a message that says that the latest version requires iOS 7, but you may download the latest compatible version. Touch Download and it will install.\nThese are the updates appearing in the badge count.\n\nA: I see that behavior for apps that require iOS 7. I'm still on iOS 6 and when going to Purchased -> All there is an Update button for apps that have an update available. When I tap the button the App Store suggests to install the last compatible version of the app.\n\nA: This is a side effect of how iOS notifications work - or in this case, what happens when they don't work.\nI see this sort of error on game center when the notification for a turn arrives well in advance of the actual game data.\nIt's kind of like when you check email and get a notification (and there you even get some data from the mail envelope - who sent it, date, subject), but the body of the email is still getting processed and send to your mailbox.\nOn the Mac app store side of things, I've seen this mismatch for hours and even in some cases days when the app gets hung up. The iOS app store is much more mature so I assume the server infrastructure is either coded more robustly or it has more resources and the delay between an update being signaled and actually available for your device to download is less.\nAs to how to fix it, you can't really send a reset to the app store app and need to wait it out.\n\nA: Need to be a little patient. If you have different devices with different IOS like 6 and 7. AND SHARE THE ACCOUNT, the device on IOS 6 will keep updating the badge count for apps that it is trying to download that were purchased somewhere else or on another device. Go to the IOS 7 device first and do the Purchased - All thing like stated above. Then repeat on other IOS devices. This cleared the badge for me. I think its more of a communication thing in Notifications between the different IOS devices.....\n\nA: *\n\n*Open in iTunes on PC and download the latest version of the app that is causing the problem.\n\n*On the iPhone, go to /var/mobile/aplications/\"app name\" and delete iTunesMetadata.plist\nThis bug happens because with the iOS 7 release there are different versions of apps for each OS (e.g. Evernote).\nTo find the app that is causing the problem, go on the App Store → Purchased and scroll down until you see the app that has Update near, but will not update because you have iOS 6 or lower.\n\nA: No sync needed. You need to download the latest version of the app in the computer so it goes in the cloud and doesn't show as update when you access the App Store on the iPhone.\nThe other badge is from the app already installed on the phone. There is no way to remove that without deleting iTunesMetadata.plist (I think you can access the phone's root filesystem even without jailbreak using other applications on the computer).\n", "Q: Can I remove the text beneath apps on the iOS 7 home screen (SpringBoard)? The text beneath the apps looks really out of place with the new iOS 7. Is there any way to turn it off without jailbreaking?\n\nA: No this is not possible. Not in the standard iOS package anyway. \nI have no experience with jailbroken iOS, but I would assume so, although there is no JB for iOS 7 just yet. \n", "Q: iPhone showing Connect to iTunes screen when updating to iOS 7 I have just attempted to update my iPhone 4 to iOS 7. The phone switched itself off after a while and now the phone won't work any more. The screen switched back on with the logo of iTunes and the charger with an arrow pointing to the iTunes logo.\nI connected the phone to my Mac and it doesn't recognise my phone at all, asking to restore it to the factory setting. If I do that, would I lose everything on it?\n\nA: Yes you will. The same thing happened to mine, everything was wiped out after the restore. Make sure your stuff is backed up.\n\nA: you can download Tinyumbrella and inside tinyumbrella, select your \"restore device\" (as it likely is called) and choose to \"exit recovery\", if this doesn't help, you're probably out of luck. :-/ But I guess you either have an iTunes based or iCloud based backup of your phone, so there is still hope you don't lose all your data\n", "Q: AirPlay video, but play audio on device Is it possible to AirPlay video from my iPad 2 on an Apple TV, but play the audio on my iPad?\n\nA: As far as I know, it's not possible without jailbreak.but if your iPhone is jailbroken, you can at least redirect the sound to your headphones : http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130312010845251\nI didn't try it since my phone is not jailbroken. \nHope that helps !\n", "Q: how can I recover a file overwritten in the .app directory inside /Applications on OSX I am using Android Studio and the application is stored in /Application/Android Studio.app.\nI'm not sure why, but at some point my keystore file was stored inside this directory, in the bin directory. It is no longer there. I assume that an update occurred, and the entire directory Android Studio.app was wiped. And, the key was deleted. Since this is outside my home folder, I don't believe I have a backup of the keystore file.\nAre these files backed up, or put into the trash? Is there a way to recover this file?\n\nA: If you have Time Machine enabled as a local store option or backing up to an external drive, then that file would be backed up - perhaps several versions and stores. \nThe filesystems Apple ships do not have any archive or redo, so you would need to have backed up your application. It's odd that it would store things in the application bundle and not the user home folder. Did you check that perhaps it moved the files to the proper location as part of an update?\n", "Q: What happens to a blocked caller? So I can block callers from iOS 7 now (Settings > Messages > Blocked) and I'm told it blocks voice, iMessages, and FaceTime. What happens when they try to contact me? Are they told the number is disconnected or do they get some kind of recording? If they call, does it ring indefinitely? Same for FaceTime? Do their texts bounce back or are they sent thought I never see them?\n\nA: As someone posted in your question, it's not true call blocking in that the call still connects to your service but the phone silently rejects it without any indication to you. Since it still hits your voicemail, it's not really blocked, just not answered (more like Do Not Disturb)\nI just tried this with my wife's phone. When she called, she initially hears a single ring but then it is immediately bumped to voicemail. \nAs I mentioned you aren't made aware of this, and to the caller it just appears that you've instantly declined the call. \nWith regards to SMSs, you can still send them SMSs and they can even see when you're typing the message, however, you won't see them typing, nor will you receive any texts from them. On iMessage, it actually appears to them that you have received the message. \n", "Q: How to cut a file from my USB drive and paste it elsewhere in Finder on Mac OS X 10.6.8? When I click Cmd-X to try and cut the file on my USB drive so I can paste it elsewhere and free up space on my USB, it does nothing, and when I Ctrl-click it only gives the option to copy the file, not cut it.\nHow to cut-and-paste a file on OS X?\n\nA: Use CmdC to copy, then OptCmdV to paste in a new location and delete from the original location.\n", "Q: Check Camera Path through command line is that a command to type in terminal that lists all the webcams connected to my computer?

Now I can't seem to get it back.\nI need that format. I changed a UK Format to my needs but having a predefined option would make me much happier. \nAny suggestions on how to get it back?\n(I'm running OSX 10.8.5)\n\nA: You can change date format, decimal sign, etc. under:\nsystem preferences > language & text > region (tab)\nI believe if you set your region to english and then go to \nsystem preferences > language & text > language (tab) \nand select German there, you should have \"German (English)\" back.\n\nA: Go to the System Preferences from the dock.\n\nNow select Language & Text and go to the Region tab. Click on Show all regions and you should have it like this.\n\nIn the region selector, select German -> Your country\n\nAnd it should bring it back. Hope this helps.\n\nA: In Mavericks the Date Settings are finally independent from the language.

I have a terminal command that I would like to run.\n    telnet 169.254.216.127 54326\n\nIdeally I would like to convert this into a .command file and be able to share it with many other mac users without them having to give permissions using sudo... \nIs this possible? Can I create an extremely simple app that keeps the terminal window open after it has run?\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: The execute permission does also transfer to other computers. If the permissions of the file are lost when you transfer the file, you might create a zip or tar archive for the .command file:\n$ echo telnet 169.254.216.127 54326 > test.command\n$ chmod +x test.command\n$ tar -cf test.tar test.command\n$ \n\nYou might also save a script like this as an application in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"telnet 169.254.216.127 54326\"\n    activate\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to configure Apache for XAMPP on Mac OS X Lion to use mod_rewrite?

Everything was fine.  Now everything is gone, including on iCloud.\nHe has no back up elsewhere.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You might want to put both devices in offline mode (or power down the router) in case the duplicates were not really and the calendars were deleted.\nYou can use another computer (or a web browser) to log into iCloud.com and inspect the calendars as far as Apple sees things.\nIf the calendar data is still in the cloud, then your missing data is due to an error on each device or a temporary network condition.\n\nA: Have you checked backups on your local machine?  iOS backups specifically. I have used iBackupBot to cherry pick lost data from past backups & restore to my iDevice.  Additionally, you could do a brute force restore from a backup to see if that brings it back.\n", "Q: Since I updated to iOS 7, my OverDrive Media app crashes every time I try to use it. What to do? My OverDrive Media app crashes every time I try to open a book. This never happened before I updated my iPad mini to iOS 7. I can open the app fine and go to the NYPL page, but as soon as I try to open any title the app crashes.\nI've tried turning my iPad off then on again, but it still happens. I updated the OverDrive Media app before I downloaded iOS 7 and it was fine then. I don't particularly want to uninstall it then download it again, so if there's any other solution please let me know!\n\nA: This is already a known issue with the app crashing on iOS 7, they'll put out a fix soon.\n\nThe upgrade to iOS7 has resulted in problems for many OverDrive Media Console users.\nWe are working on getting a new version into the App Store.

I checked Control Center a bit later and saw an AirPlay icon going to \"iPhone Speaker\". I have no idea why (we don't have any air play devices, let alone with that name), I don't know how it got selected, and I'm no longer seeing it. So… is that normal?\nI noticed it again while playing a voicemail. It seems to directly control if the speakerphone is on or if it goes through the earpiece (not surprising really). But, can anyone explain what this has to do with AirPlay?\n\n\n\nA: It just makes it easier to locate where Airplay selection is. In other words, it is obvious you select it to change to Airplay. \n\nA: Try ending all running applications, it should go away. It's most probably because u have 2 music applications on. Hope this helps cheers ;)\n\nA: The \"AirPlay\" section of Control Center does more than just the Apple AirPlay protocol.  It shows where sound is being output.  In this area, you might see:\n\n\n*\n\n*AirPlay:  AppleTV Name\n\n*iPhone Speaker\n\n*Dock Connector:  Device-name, perhaps your in-car System\n\n*Bluetooth:  Headset-name\n\"Headphones\" doesn't appear in the AirPlay section of the Control Center, but if you tap the button and click through to the AirPlay choices, \"Headphones\" will usually be a choice if they are connected.\n\n", "Q: iTunes on iOS 7 Crashing Since Friday 9/20/2013, when I try to open iTunes on my iPhone 4s (running iOS 7), it crashes.  I was able to open it to do a search and purchase a song, but after it started downloading, it crashed.  Every time I try to re-open it, it crashes after a couple of seconds.  I've tried unloading it from memory and that doesn't fix it.  I also completely shutdown and powered on the phone, but that doesn't fix it either.\nI can't believe completely wiping my phone would be the only way to fix this; any other suggestions?\n\nA: You don't have many other levers other than a full backup and I erasing all content and settings as a general remedy, but I would probably try the following for resorting to a wipe:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the usage and delete some content so that you have at least one gigabyte of free space\n\n*Signout of iTunes Home sharing and iTunes match\n\n*Sign out of the App Store\n\n*Make sure the date and time are set correctly or automatically set\n\n*Put the device in airplane mode, then power down and start back up while in airplane mode\n\n\nIf the music app is still misbehaving after removing all the network influences it might be something about your iTunes library on the device.

I noticed that iOS 7 on my iPad now says this in the Bluetooth pane of the preferences if Bluetooth is turned off: \"Location accuracy and nearby services are improved when Bluetooth is turned on.\"\nHow does Bluetooth improve location accuracy? I know that Wifi improves accuracy because Apple has various Wifi networks mapped out, but how could Bluetooth help?\n\nA: Let me start with some background info: \nWiFi has a signal range (radius) of about 300 feet (outdoors)\nIf I detect your WiFi you could be anywhere in that 100,000 sqft large area.\nBluetooth has a signal range of 30 feet (outdoors).\nSo placing your BT in to the Discovery mode and if I can detect your Bluetooth you must be very close :)\nUsing both signals one can set your location more accurate.\n\nBackground: Abstract —Crowd-sourced Wi-Fi-based localization systems uti- lize\n  user input for RF scene analysis and map construction. Such systems\n  reduce the deployment cost and privacy concerns that expert-based site\n  survey systems can create. However, t he main bottleneck of such\n  crowd-sourcing localization systems is a bootstrapping stage, where\n  lack of contributions by users result s in no accuracy guarantee and\n  frequent unnecessary prompting for users’ input, even for explored\n  areas. In this paper, we prop ose a crowd-sourcing localization system\n  that uses both Wi-Fi scene analysis and Bluetooth beacons to address\n  the insufficient con- tribution challenge. After prompting for user\n  input, the mobile device not only submits Wi-Fi fingerprint to a map\n  server, but also enables Bluetooth beacons to disseminate/share its\n  location and fingerprint information to quickly populate the signal\n  map. Then, subsequent user devices entering the area can discover the\n  Bluetooth beacons and are able to instantly obtain room-level location\n  information without causing unnecessary prompting to users. We\n  implement our proposed system in the Linux OS and evaluate the\n  prototype extensively through both experiments and simulation.\nOur evaluation results show that using Bluetooth beacons help to\n  improve signal map growth, while maintaining reasonable localization\n  accuracy.\n\nApple subtly introduced iBeacon as part of iOS 7 at WWDC 2013, though it mentioned the feature only in a single keynote slide and didn't go into detail at all. But this hasn't stopped companies from taking advantage and launching products and services that make use of iBeacon.\niBeacon essentially makes way for new range of apps and functions. With it, stores can pipe coupons to your phone, mapping apps can offer indoor navigation and more. Here's the real clincher: iBeacon might just be that nail in the coffin for NFC.\nSo finally to answer your question, once upon a time one could go completely anonymous in to the mall and just browse around. Now days everyone will know you are in the mall, more, they will know what store you went in to. How about that for location accuracy.\n\nA: iOS 7 introduced support for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) iBeacons. These are small Bluetooth devices that can be placed to indicate a very specific location and the system respond in some way when they are detected. Enter a shop and an app for the shop showing you the latest offers might be one way for this to be leveraged. This would be different from usual geolocation APIs which become inaccurate when you are inside large structures (offices, malls etc.) as they cannot get a GPS fix, and WiFi coverage tends to be meshed with repeater stations\n\nA: It's worth noting that since asking this question, iBeacons have gained more traction. Apple now uses them in their stores to give locations specific information on product displays (http://www.zdnet.com/apple-launches-ibeacon-in-254-stores-to-streamline-shopping-experience-7000024026/), and other companies are starting to follow suit. \n\nA: \nApple has various Wifi networks mapped out\n\nNot correct. This was done by Google. Their Street View photographing vehicles had built in WiFi wardriving equipment.\nApple couldn't have done this without physically driving through almost every street on the planet.\n", "Q: My mother changed her session password and now the system can't unlock the \"login\" keychain The title says most of it. My mother changed her password through the Accounts pane of System Preferences to a lengthy one (17 characters) about three weeks ago. Then, the next day, she left for Spain, and she came back today. I'm pretty sure she didn't log out between the time she changed her password and the time she shut down her computer on the day she left.\nNow, when she logs in, the system shows a dialog box that says it can't unlock her login keychain, and suggests that she either updates the password or create a new login keychain. I tried with her old password, a variation of her old password, her current password and a few variations of her current password and nothing does it. My only conclusion is that somehow, something changed her session password to something that is neither her old password nor her new password. The question now is, what could have done that, and what can it be?\n\nA: 17 rang a bell and I typed her password one character at a time and tried after each character, and the login keychain password had apparently been set to the first 16 characters of her password. I'm not sure how that could happen and I was not able to reproduce it on my machine, but there. Now she thinks I'm the best son in the world.\n", "Q: In Google Drive on iOS, how do you change sharing permissions to be anything other than \"Private\"? In Google Drive on iOS, how do you change sharing permissions for a file or folder from \"Private\" to \"Anyone with the link\" or \"Public on the web\"?  I only see a way to add named users.\n\n\nA: I cannot find a way but I did find a work around.  Open google drive via web browser and change view to desktop.  This option is located at the very bottom of the screen.  It's irritating but at least you can do it on your iPad.\n", "Q: Notes on iOS 7 crashing on Startup After upgrading to iOS 7 the standard Notes app crashes when starting it.\nI'm running iOS 7.0 and have reproduced this after a clean power down of the phone.\n\nA: Took me a while to figure this out so I'll share it if it helps someone else:\n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of tapping on the Notes icon, search for a specific note in spotlight then open that note.\n\n\nAfter that Notes will work normally again.\n(Apple knows about the bug but they didn't fix it in time for the release.)\n\nA: You could also open Siri and tell Siri\nNote hello\nI would note \"hello\" for you click on it and it opens notes and it would work like normall\n", "Q: Not getting white boot screen background on white iPad/iPhone (iOS 7)? Is this a bug I need to report or is this normal or what? On both my white iPad 2 and my white iPhone 4S running iOS 7, I thought the boot screen was supposed to be white/gray with a dark Apple logo, but I'm getting the black screen with the white logo. But since it's the same on both devices maybe I'm missing something. Any ideas?\n\nA: The color-specifc boot screens are only available on the iPhone 5 and later.\nOn these devices, the boot screen will match the colour of the front panel e.g. a white iPhone 5 will display a white screen with a black Apple logo.\n\nA: The iOS boot screen prior to iOS 6 has always been a black screen with a white(-ish plus silver/gray details) Apple logo.\n", "Q: European week numbers to iOS calendar? I have never really used the calendar in iOS and the below is the reason. I need week numbers for my work, studies, hobbies and almost everything -- that is why I am still using a paper calendar. If a boss gives me a new task, it can be just monday week 33 8PM something -- now I go to paper calendar without touching the phone.\n\nWhere you can see that adding week numbers preserves every day on the right. Also you need to click to day to see the week number which is outrageously slow.\nIf I want to have European week numbers, I need to subscribe to Week Number calendar outlined here and it ruins the availability dots in the calendar like the right. I am looking forward to see week numbers in the month view without preserving every day. \nHow can I get the European week numbers to iOS calendar without preserving every day and still being visible in the month view?\n\nA: I use Week Calendar by UtiliTap instead of the built-in calendar - it's not a free app but it's not expensive and works really well. \n\n\nA: Starting with iOS 8, there's now a built-in way to show week numbers in the calendar. Go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars and scroll down to the Calendars section. Enable Week Numbers and they show up nicely in the built-in calendar app. \n\n\nA: This is correct, in IOS 8.x you may switch on to display week numbers, but you cannot set the ISO (European) counting rule: the first week of the year is the first week, which contains Thursday, whereas US calendars have always 53 weeks, except if the week starts with Sunday. Therefore there may come to a difference of 1 week, which is the case for the year 2016\n", "Q: Encrypt data before sync to dropbox? If I have FileVault on, this will encrypt all my data on my HDD. so this said, will this send to dropbox the encrypted files or the original files?\n\nA: No as Dropbox is running as one of your apps and so sees the unencrypted data.\nWhat you can do is create an encrypted disk image in your dropbox area using Disk Utility (or TrueCrypt etc). Dropbox only sees the encrypted image but you have to mount the disk yourself.\nthere are other cloud services e.g. SpiderOak that say they store encrypted data and don't have the key to decrypt.\n\nA: There is BoxCryptor which acts as an encryption layer atop Dropbox and has clients for OS X, Windows, iOS and Android. \n\nBoxcryptor is the right solution for all private and business needs. Once you have installed Boxcryptor, you can easily encrypt files in your Boxcryptor Drive and store them in your cloud provider’s folder (e.g. your Dropbox folder). You will keep control of your data and enjoy 24/7 peace of mind knowing that your data is securely stored in the cloud.\n\n", "Q: Can I install any iOS version I wish by picking and choosing which firmware to restore? I'm trying to downgrade my iPhone from the current iOS to an older one, as per this question.\nBut every time I try, I always receive this error:\n\nThe iPhone could not be restored. This device isn't eligible for the requested build.\n\n\nI have tried many times with and without DFU mode. Any ideas regarding this?\n\nA: Downgrading or upgrading to a no longer current version of iOS is generally not possible once Apple stops signing the old software, as is needed when iTunes is preparing to install or restore an iOS. This signing window typically is closed within days of a new version shipping. \nPutting a newer iOS on older hardware that never even supported that OS is near impossible.\nAs part of the iOS restore process, iTunes has to check with Apple's servers to 'sign' each install of iOS just like App Store apps must be signed to run. Once a new version comes out, Apple stops signing previous releases to keep everyone running the same iOS version and to prevent you from jailbraking your device again after restoring by forcing you to do an update.\nIf you had previously Jailbroken your device on iOS 6, it may be possible, providing you have saved your 'SHSH blobs' which can 'sign' the install instead of Apple. See this article for some general information around this topic.\nThis wikipedia page contains a list of iOS devices & the latest iOS they can support - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devices\n\nA: Note: There is a new method of downgrading/upgrading that doesn't require Apple to be currently signing, and it works on newer devices that aren't present in the first list of my answer below. The tool for it is called futurerestore (codenamed Prometheus). The biggest caveat to this tool is that you must be jailbroken in most cases before initiating the restore (and you only have one shot, so a failed restore will force you to install a signed firmware) (if that signed firmware is also jailbreakable, then technically you get second chances, but it's rare for that to be the case unless there's a bootrom exploit for your device). Right now, the best tutorial for Prometheus is by @iPodHacks142 and is endorsed by the author of Prometheus, @tihmstar. I will be updating this answer later to explain more about it, but I wanted to get this information posted here sooner rather than later.\nOther Note: I am missing information about the original Odysseus which allows a few 32-bit iOS devices to downgrade in the iOS 6 and 7 range.\nOther Other Note: There is an even newer method of downgrading/upgrading that will allow almost all 32-bit devices (doesn't include the 32-bit devices that can install iOS 10) to go from iOS 9.3.5 firmware to any other iOS 9.X firmware.\nOther Other Other Note: There is an new bootrom exploit for A5 to A11 devices called checkm8. It can allow you to install any IPSW as long as valid SHSH blobs are provided (it is unclear if you need a valid APTicket as well, as it's been demonstrated it isn't necessary in some cases).\nWhen I find some time, I will add these to the answer below. My answer is still up-to-date (other than anything having to do with these notes).\n\n\nIn short, unless you have one of the following devices (devices with A4 processors or earlier, hereafter referred to as \"pre-A5 devices\"), you cannot install anything except for the iOS versions that Apple currently signs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone (1st generation)\n\n*iPhone 3G\n\n*iPhone 3GS\n\n*iPhone 4\n\n*iPod touch (1st generation)\n\n*iPod touch (2nd generation)\n\n*iPod touch (3rd generation)\n\n*iPod touch (4th generation)\n\n*iPad (1st generation)\n\n*Apple TV (2nd generation)\n\n\nThe following subset of devices do not utilize SHSH blobs, and can therefore install any version of iOS at-will:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone (1st generation)\n\n*iPod touch (1st generation)\n\n\nIt is important to note that while all devices listed in the first section do have working bootrom exploits, there are different types of bootrom exploits, and each allow for different levels of boot manipulation.\nThe following devices can utilize a special bootrom exploit that allows for installing any version of iOS without SHSH blobs:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 3G\n\n*iPhone 3GS (old bootrom)\n\n*iPod touch (2nd generation)\n\n*iPod touch (3rd generation)\n\n\nThe following devices have a different bootrom exploit known as limera1n, which allows installation of any version of iOS as long as valid SHSH blobs are provided:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 3GS (new bootrom)\n\n*iPhone 4\n\n*iPod touch (4th generation)\n\n*iPad (1st generation)\n\n*Apple TV (2nd generation)\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\nInstalling iOS on any device using a bootrom exploit requires you to put your device into a state known as Pwned DFU, which allows you to install custom firmware. You'll also need:\n\n\n*\n\n*SHSH blobs (if required) for your device for the particular version of iOS that you wish to install\n\n*A valid APTicket (for iOS 5 and above) for your device for that version of iOS\n\n*The .ipsw for your device for that version of iOS\n\n*iTunes (version 11.0.5 or earlier for the iPhone 4)\n\n\nIf you do happen to fall into the small group of users that have all of these pieces, consider yourself lucky, as you can use iFaith by iH8sn0w to stitch your SHSH blobs into the firmware to create a custom IPSW that you can use with iTunes after you put your device into Pwned DFU using iREB inside iFaith.\n\nFurther Research\nNot all instances of the iPhone 3GS are the same. Models manufactured in early 2010 or earlier (old bootrom) have a bootrom exploit that allows for downgrading without SHSH blobs, while newer models (new bootrom) have a separate exploit that allows for downgrading with SHSH blobs.\nIt is in fact possible to install iOS versions that Apple isn't singing anymore on devices newer than pre-A5 devices in very specific circumstances. The two devices that qualify are the iPhone 4S and the iPad (2nd generation). Using redsn0w, the iPad (2nd generation) can be downgraded to iOS 5 from any newer version, and the iPhone 4S can move from any version of iOS 5.x to any other version of iOS 5.x. Both of these operations require multiple specific sets of valid SHSH blobs and APTickets.\nFor all devices which contain an SEP chip (Secure Enclave Processor) (i.e. iPhone 5s and beyond), an exploit will be necessary against the chip itself in addition to a bootrom exploit, or else the SEP chip will reject the firmware. You can, however, construct an .ipsw that contains an older version of the SEP firmware so long as that older version is being signed or you have an exploit that allows you to replay the old signature. If the older version is not supported on the version of iOS that you're installing, Touch ID and other SEP-dependent features will be disabled.\nYou can save SHSH blobs during the signing window and manage them yourself, or you can use iFaith to have them be saved and managed for you with Saurik's Cydia server.\nFor pre-A5 devices, it is usually possible to extract valid SHSH blobs and APTickets for the current firmware regardless of that firmware's signing status. iFaith was developed to perform this operation. A situation in which this may not be possible would be if you arrived on your current firmware via an OTA (over the air) update.\niH8sn0w has some unreleased downgrade exploits for devices that do not contain an SEP chip.\n@unimp0rtanttech (known more commonly as n00neimp0rtant in the jailbreak community) has hinted that he also has some downgrade exploits in the works.\nSome iOS OTA (over-the-air) firmware images (for certain versions of iOS for certain devices) are still being signed by Apple. Installation of these images is possible, and there is a tool called OdysseusOTA (a derivation of Odysseus) to do just that. You must be jailbroken to use the tool, because you need to have tfp0 enabled (to bootstrap a custom firmware image in RAM, which requires modification of the kernel's VM region). The tool bootstraps a custom iBSS that manually installs an OTA firmware image fully-signed by Apple.\n\nThis answer will be kept up-to-date as much as possible.\n\nA: You have to download the wanted IPSW file.\nOpen iTunes and shift+click on \"restore\"\nGo to your file you downloaded and click on it.\niTunes will do the rest.\nIf you had the beta of iOS 7 you may be able to go back to iOS 6.1.3/4.\nIf you have iOS 6 SHSH blobs you may also be able to get back iOS 6. But if\nyou don't, you have to download iOS 7.0.\n", "Q: Can't install apps from App Store on iPhone with iOS 7 I upgraded my iPhone 4 to iOS 7 last night but now I can't download apps using the App Store on my iPhone. It's still possible to get the apps using iTunes on my computer and syncing my phone, but this is cumbersome.\nI get errors as shown below:\n\nUnable to Purchase\n  [app name] could not be purchased at this time. Please try again later.\n\n\n\n\nIs this a known issue, and how can I rectify it?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is a somewhat common problem and there is no easy solution that is guaranteed to work (other than trying again later or downloading through iTunes on a computer and syncing).\nOne possibility is that this error indicates Apple's app store not being able to service your request. In that case, it does not have anything to do with the model of the iPhone or the version of iOS it's running (although you're seeing this after the upgrade to iOS 7, this error is seen in previous versions too).\nAnother possibility is that you have some pending app downloads (that you may have paused) and the App Store app's download information database is corrupted. In this case you could try deleting the (possibly corrupt) download information database on the iPhone to have the App Store app rebuild its database (to be safe, make sure you have a backup of your phone in iTunes before you attempt this).\n\nA: I would suggest trying the following options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the power button and the home button until the Apple logo appears. Once it restarts, try downloading.\n\n*Reset your router from which you are accessing your Wi-Fi.\n\n*If the issue persists, trying downloading apps from a different Wi-Fi network or cellular data.\n\n*If these fail, Reset Network Settings (Settings > General > Reset) and do steps 2 and 3.\n\n*If the issue still persists, Reset All Settings (Settings > General > Reset) and try again.\n\n*As a last resort, take your phone to an Apple Store.\n\n\nA: This error message most often means that your connection has been interrupted partway through a download, and less often but fairly frequently means that there is an issue with your transaction when trying to download the application.\n\nUpdate: for your specific case, this might be the source problem.\n\nCommon root causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*poor internet connectivity. try switching internet connection, restarting your iphone, restarting wireless routers between you and the internet, or simply waiting until a less busy time (try downloading large apps at night, if you're on a perpetually slow connection). There's a very slight chance that this might be hardware damage to your phone's antenna and/or wireless connection chips, which would be best diagnosed at an Apple store.\n\n*corrupt credit card or other account information in the iTunes store. Log in to your account with itunes, and review all of your information (has your billing address changed for your credit card?)\n\n*space issues on your iphone. There might not be enough space on your phone to download the application. There are specific error message for this kind of problem, but they are sometimes masked and show up as above.\n\n*Undefined or unstable software configuration. Download status, or other, store or net connectivity related information may be in a corrupt state on your iphone. The least thought intensive solution is to back up your phone, wipe all data, reinstall the OS on the phone and then restore the data from backup. There are much simpler solutions if you can identify specificaly that it's data corruption, and the potential causes for the data corruption. Please note that some states of data corruption (such as might happen if you've been messing with unlocking the phone) might not be fixable like this - you might have to remember what you did, and undo it manually.\n\n*Hardware, connectivity or other problems on the iTunes store server side This doesn't happen frequently, but when it does, can leave you disconnected from the store for a day or two, sometimes longer. (imagine, for example, if the store is experiencing a DDoS from somewhere on your network). Wait a week, then try again. Occasionally (very rarely), it's be worth rebooting the iphone after you've waited, and before trying again \n\n\n\nIf you've tried the easier solutions to the most common problems, and they haven't worked out, go to the Apple store and have a technician look at your phone. They usually have tools that will help quickly diagnose the more common, but harder to discover, problems, and won't usually charge you anything other than your time waiting, for finding the problem.\n\nA: I was missing the download icons for some apps. I went into restrictions and changed the app ratings to allow all ages content. Then the download icon apppeared. \n\nA: To deal with this go to settings then go to restrictions and see the row of installing apps. Switch it on and off several times, then close settings and go to App Store. Now u should be able to download or update apps normally. Hope it works for u.\n\nA: I had the same problem as you for some reason I couldn't download any apps. And then I decided to reset my router. Turns out it was just a problem with the router after all. If you have cisco I recommend downloading linksys connect, it really helps!\n\nA: My solution was to reboot at first, then boot & go to the Restrictions page, and there I switched \"Require password\" option from \"15 min\" to \"Immediately\". \nAll my frozen downloads began to ask for password, one by one.\n\nA: just goto settings and switch off the wifi and switch it on. I used 3G network i did that switch off and on, the problem reolved.\n\nA: I found the solution.\nWhen you are in the App Store, switch your tab to Updates at bottom-right and select Purchased and try it from there.\n", "Q: Remove app preview from iOS 7 multitasking Using an iPad Mini, I preferred the paged, compact style of the app\nswitcher in iOS 6.

Is this possible after the upgrade? Can it show my company name everywhere, i.e. in iTunes Connect, Member Center etc.?\n\nA: The best manner to accomplish this is to contact Apple Developer Program Support directly. \nYou can find their phone number and initiate a support ticket from this web page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/contact/\nI have found them to be expert at getting you the information you need to effect a smooth and orderly transition and help you from registering incorrectly or having any assets trapped in limbo if you make the transition incorrectly.\n\nA: Apple now provides an \"Individual to Organization Membership Update\" form to convert a personal account to a business account.\n\nA: First and foremost, you must have a D-U-N-S number from D&B Inc. This is a number unique to your business entity that serves as a way for Apple (and other organizations) to identify your business.\nGetting a new D-U-N-S number can take 30-45 days for normal registration via D&B's site but you can speed up this process for an extra fee if you register via this link, it only takes 5-7 business days.\nHowever, if you already have a legal entity for your business, you may already have this number and not know it. This may not work for brand-new legal entities, but you can search the D&B Business Directory for your entities legal name and request to receive an email with your DUNS number for free. You can also search your company/organization name via Apple D-U-N-S Number Lookup site and (if needed) request a D-U-N-S number for it.\nOnce you get the D-U-N-S number, you can use it to fill out Apple's Individual to Organization Membership Update form to request that your individual account be changed to a company/organization account. This is different from the \"Enterprise\" tier, which costs more money and is intended for businesses that need to privately distribute apps outside of the App Store.\n", "Q: How can my wife use my iPod touch with her Facebook account?

I understand that Apple offers their own Limited Warranty for a year, but sadly (inevitably?) my phone is a few months beyond that.\nAs I live in the United Kingdom, I know every product has to have a six year warranty, even Apple's, and that's reflected on their website.\nSo, what are my options? Will Apple repair my phone for free? Do I need to go back to the company I bought my phone through? Is this sort of defect even covered by the two year warranty?\n\nA: The first thing to do is to request service from Apple or an Apple Authorized service provider. They will diagnose exactly what's wrong, whether they can cover it and what the cost would be for an \"Apple\" repair, which for a home button means the device is swapped with a new/refurbished unit.\nIf they deny warranty service, you can clarify if it's due to time or some other reason. At that point, if it's purely a time issue - you might be able to request a consumer law exception here:\n\n*\n\n*http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/statutoryrights.html\nJust because Apple's warranty is one year, you are also covered any statutory time periods which in Europe is generally 2 years. It's important to present the device for service (online or in person) as soon as you can. Here are some pertinent footnotes from the page above:\n\nIn most EU member states, consumers may only claim for defects that were present on delivery.\nThe burden to prove that the defect (including latent defects) existed on delivery generally shifts to the consumer after the expiry of a period of 6 months from date of delivery.\nIn most EU member states, consumers may only claim consumer law rights against the seller from whom they purchased the product.\n\nSo if you didn't buy it from Apple, your consumer law claim would need to go to your vendor and not the manufacturer (since in that case they wouldn't be the same). Also, it's not an open-shut case since there could have been a latent defect present at manufacture, but it could also be a case where a physical switch failed due to normal use. I would presume Apple would take care of you if it were clear to them that there were a defect at assembly, but I don't know how they would procedurally come to that conclusion. I don't suppose each genius bar would open and look for a defect under the home button or if they would have a policy or if each case is handled as they arrive.\nIt's pretty easy to read up on this, but I would be interested in hearing how this actually went from someone in the UK to give you concrete advice.\n\nA: @bmike is entirely correct about getting a warranty replacement (or not), but here's the workaround for this issue, as shown to me by a Genius when I had the same problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Settings\"\n\n*Enable AssistiveTouch at General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch\n\n*\n\n*Optionally, enable \"Triple-click Home\" to show/hide the AssistiveTouch dot.\n\n\n*Tap the AssistiveTouch dot\n\n*Tap \"Device\"\n\n*The \"Lock Screen\" icon behaves exactly like the lock/power button.\n\n\nYou can turn off the phone by holding down the Lock Screen icon, but you'll have to plug it into a power supply to turn it back on.\n", "Q: How do I make NFS automounted volumes visible in Finder?

When traveling internationally and connecting to an 802.11g wireless network I'm unable to connect because non-US access points default to using channel 13 and up. From what I hear if the Mac Book Pro is purchased in Europe then it can access those channels.\nIs there a way to update / tweak / etc. a US Mac Book Pro to access wireless channels 13 and up?\n\nA: There's a rather easy solution. Right click your clock, select \"Open date & time preferences\". Click \"Time Zone\" and select \"Tokyo - Japan\". Then either reboot or go to sleep mode. After you power up you should see all of the channels.\nUpdate (digging deeper):\nThe reason this happens is that the mac reads all wifi signals and takes country code from the strongest one, setting it as global. If it's transmitting a country code which has a blocked 13/14 channel, these channels will be blocked globally.\nSo what you could do is check the country code on your wifi router and bring your laptop as close to it as possible.\nTo see which country code is transmitted by the nearby routers and blocked / unblocked channels, go to the \"About this mac -> System report -> Network -> Wi-Fi\". There should be a list of channels enabled for the current session under the \"Interfaces -> en1 -> Supported Channels\". There should also be a list of networks under the \"Current Network Information\".\nCheck if there's any network with the wrong country code and should you know its owner, ask him to set the proper one. If your router does transmit a proper country code, just bring your laptop as close to it as possible and reboot / got to sleep and wake up. This should refresh the list of available channels for the session.\n\nA: After research on Internet, the problem has always been. And the only one solution I've found is to change your AirPort Card to an European model.

I recently needed to change all their passwords, so I SSHed in and ran this command, which was what I used when creating new user accounts on those machines:\nsudo dscl . passwd /Users/administrator thePassword\n\nUnfortunately, this didn't do what I thought when used on an existing user—the new password is not thePassword and so I've lost access to sudo. man dscl has this to say:\npasswd\n Usage: passwd user_path [new_pasword | old_password new_pasword]\n\n Changes a password for a user. The user must be specified by full path,\n not just a username.  If you are authenticated to the node (either by\n specifying the -u and -P flags or by using the auth command when in\n interactive node) then you can simply specify a new password.  If you are\n not authenticated then the user's old password must be specified.  If\n passwords are not specified while in interactive mode, you will be\n prompted for them.  Passing these passwords on the command line is inher-\n ently insecure and can cause password exposure.  For better security do\n not provide the password as part of the command and you will be securely\n prompted.\n\nSo it looks like I should have provided the user's old password when running that previous command, but I didn't. I know what password I entered and I still have SSH access to the machines. If I can figure out what the command did, I'll be able to tell what password I set on the accounts.\n\nA: Ah, it turns out that that is the correct way to change a user's password when using sudo. If you don't use sudo, only then do you need to provide the user's old password.\nMy problem was that there was a '$' character in the password, which I didn't escape. Consequently, the passwords were cut off to before the $ character.\n", "Q: Iphone 4s upgrade to iOS7 - Calendar appointments are gone Upgraded my iPhone 4s to iOS 7; now my calendar appointments are completely missing from the phone.

I have rules that send emails to certain folders, and they work just fine both on the MS Outlook side and on the iPhone (Mail) side.\nI have one rule for a particular sender that both sends that email to a folder (on the server, not locally) and marks it as read.  This rule works perfectly fine on the MS Outlook side, but on the iPhone - it not only does NOT mark the email as read, it also takes a step backwards and leaves it in the inbox.\nThe next time I go to MS Outlook, all the emails are right where they are supposed to be (in the other folder and marked as read), and after a minute or two it reflects the same status on the iPhone.\nHow can I get this rule to work properly on the iPhone without having to open up MS Outlook every time?\n\nA: Marking a message as read is claimed to be a client action but Exchange is able to perform it. The clients are not able to set up the rule.\nYou can use Exchange's web interface (Outlook Web Access) to create a server-side rule to mark messages as read.\nAn example with Exchange 2010:\n\n\nA: The action of marking an email as read forces the rule to be a \"client-only rule\", which means it will work only when MS Outlook is running (and will be done by MS Outlook and not by MS Exchange).\nYou can (re)confirm if this rule is client-only by deleting it and creating it again in MS Outlook. If you see a warning like the one shown here, then it will only work while MS Outlook is running.\n\nWhen you look at the rules you have in MS Outlook (from the \"Manage Rules & Alerts\" menu option), client-only rules will show \"(client-only)\" against the rule name.\nAlso see\nManaging Inbox Rules in Exchange Server\n", "Q: MacBook keeps connecting to guest network (Airport) Every time I open my MacBook Pro (restart or from sleep) it is always connected to my Guest Network.

The utilization on the 500 GB drive is consistent with the OmniDiskSweeper report above.\nSo both Time Machine and the laptop OS were confused about what the actual utilization was, overstating it by 120 to 135 GB. But Time machine was able to restore without including the lost disk space. But somehow Time Machine had the lost disk space in its backup records as space used, so when it tested a new drive for adequate space, it got it wrong.\nI'm not sure what happened, but it looks like I was able to get it cleared up in a very round-about way. I have reclaimed over 120 - 135 GB of drive space.\n\nA: I had similar issue where the used disk space shown in Finder was about 20 GB more than what the size of all files should have been.\nWhen I tried verifying the main OS X volume (like Macintosh HD; not the drive) in Disk Utility, there was an error about an invalid free block count. I was able to get rid of the error and free up the disk space by starting up from the recovery partition and repairing the volume.\n\nA: My guess is the space is hiding in plain sight - storing local copies of Time Machine data.

I've got an early 2008 Mac Pro with 4 Gb of memory which I would like to upgrade, but I'm unsure of the memory speed. In my \"About This Mac\" dialog it says the memory speed should be 667 MHz, but online (even on Apple's own site), it says 800 MHz. Is it okay to get 800 MHz memory and mix the two, or should I hunt for 667 MHz memory? Or replace my existing 667 MHz memory with 800 MHz?\n\n\nA: According to Everymac, your Mac Pro takes 800 MHz D DDR2 RAM. I'm not sure why your Mac is reporting 667 MHz, but try using the Crucial Memory Scanner and see which they recommend for your specific system.\nAs far as mixing RAM, it can be done, but it isn't really recommended. From a question on Super User:\n\nWhen different speed RAM modules are used, all of the RAM should clock to the speed of the slowest module. Many times, I've found that mixing RAM speeds sometimes causes system instability. I've had plenty of cases where RAM sticks that tested just fine alone wouldn't play well together. So I strongly recommend that all of the RAM installed in your computer be of the same speed.\n\n\nA: The difference between 667 and 800 is negligible at best. You will not perceive any difference at all in your daily tasks regardless of what those may be, the one exception being if your job happens to be running theoretical benchmarks all day. You will get a bigger performance boost from populating all 8 slots than you will the performance decrease from having 667 in there. The price premium for 800 makes it a ridiculously poor decision, dollars/performance.\n\nA: If the 667 MHz memory is what is currently in your computer, that is what will be reported, and it works just fine in the 2008 Mac Pro, however the Mac Pro supports 800 MHz and it will run faster in the event you decided to upgrade for memory read/writes (which can be a bottle neck and you should consider upgrading if speed is that important to you.)\nI recently changed my RAM from 667 MHz to 800 MHz on my Mac Pro with the following results reported by NovaBench:\n677 MHz speeds (1 card only): \n4096 MB System RAM (Score: 104)\n- RAM Speed: 2028 MB/s\n677 MHz speeds (2 cards populated): \n8192 MB System RAM (Score: 146)\n- RAM Speed: 2132 MB/s\n800 Mhz speeds (2 cards populated):\n16384 MB System RAM (Score: 189)\n- RAM Speed: 2343 MB/s\nI've seen speeds of up to to 2600 MB/s as well with 800 MHz RAM.  I need to fiddle with the RAM and see why I am not getting those speeds right now, as I had been earlier.\nWhat ever the slowest memory is in the computer is what the Mac will run all the memory at.  So if you have 667 MHz memory and mix them, all of it will run at 667 MHz.  Replacing the memory is the only way to get the speed increase.\n\nA: I eventually went with the 667 MHz RAM, because I expect my own computer to know what's actually in it more than I'd trust external programs or websites. So far everything seems to be okay.\n", "Q: Why can't I see the weather information in Notification Center? After upgrading my iPad 4 to iOS 7, I don't see the weather forecast in the new Notification Center. The calendar is there, and the bottom of the Notification Center has the Yahoo! copyright info for the weather data, but the weather information is not displayed.\nWi-fi is turned on, but I have the location services disabled. When turning on location services, the weather info is shown. What's strange is that on my wife's iPad, the weather info is shown even with location services disabled. Both of our iPads are Wi-fi only, no 3G.\nAre you seeing the same behavior? What could be causing this inconsistency?\n\nA: I realize that this thread is old, but there are so many issues with iOS7, that there are probably many who still haven't found a solution to this.  What worked for me: Settings > Privacy > Location Services -  Turn on Location Services (if it's not already), and also, scroll down to Weather and make sure that specific app is turned on.  After that, the text weather showed up under the date on Notification Center.  And I have my Weather app in a folder.\niPhone 4S\niOS7\n\nA: Restart your iOS device.\nThis seems to be a Heisenberg bug: I restarted the iOS device after removing a \"Weather\" folder according to this answer here and I got a weather info to the summary \"Mostly clear currently. It's 2 degrees; the high will be 9 degrees.\"\nI tested also different settings in Notification Center and the changes requires restart before becoming visible.\nIt may be that the \"Weather\" folder is just a red-herring here. Anyway test Restart after changing settings.\n\nA: I had the same problem after upgrading to iOS 8, that is, no weather info in the Today summary, except the copyright link at the bottom.\nBased on randy's answer, I went to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Weather. I turned the setting off then back on, and went back up in Settings. Now the weather is in Today.\n\nA: I initially saw the same problem on my iOS 7 iPhone. Some comments here suggest that the problem stems from having the Weather app in a folder. Indeed I did have the Weather app in a folder, also called Weather. I moved the Weather app out of its folder, and renamed that folder from Weather to Meteorology. Shortly thereafter, weather information began appearing in the Notification Center. I put the Weather app back into its original folder, and renamed that folder back to Weather. Weather information continues to appear in the Notification Center.\nSo now I’m unsure whether this was the real problem or not. Perhaps the weather information server was temporarily overloaded, and this business about folders is a red herring. It’s hard for me to tell.\n@nwinkler, do you have the Weather app in a folder? If so, try removing it from that folder to see if it helps. If it seems to help you too, then I guess this was really the issue. If it doesn’t help you, or if your Weather app is not in a folder at all, then probably that wasn’t the root cause in my case either. Either way, please add a comment here to let me (and others) know!\n\nA: Backup before you do any changes so that you can replace it if anything wrong happens.\nBrowse to /var/mobile/Library/BulletinBoard/. Delete SectionInfo.plist and respring.\nNote: Once you go to safe mode it breaks again but it stays after a reboot.\nIf you go to safe mode, delete the file again and respring.\nIt fixes other problems such as Tomorrow view not showing events. I, think it forces your device to rebuild the list and correct the errors.\n\nA: In Settings > Notification Center, make sure you have the Today View and the Today Summary turned on. You will also need to enable location services for Weather. This applies even for the WiFi-ony iPad (it will obtain location data from the WiFi network).\n", "Q: Disable automatic switch to Bluetooth carkit on iPhone Whenever my iPhone connects with the Bluetooth carkit that is integrated in my car audio system, the iPhone switches AirPlay to the carkit and thus sends all audio to the carkit instead of the iPhone speaker.

I then went and downloaded GoodReader (once again). I expected the GoodReader app's data to be back after the reinstallation but it didn't.\nI also updated iTunes after the upgrade to iOS 7. I tried an app called Dr. Fone but that only gives me photos, contacts, etc. How can I get back my GoodReader data?\n\nA: This is not exactly answering to my own questions. But for those who knows programming, there is a way to get away with it. For me, I wanted to restore all photos I put in my GoodReader.\nI get into the backup directory. Used the bash command:\nls * | xargs file {} | grep image\\ data > /Desktop/backup.txt\nto list all files and it was printed like this (the first few rows):\n2:0006c6f73a741907373e2eabcb3763bebf17bdc8: PNG image data, 25 x 15, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced\n3:000bb4a992491782ef65642e1298244242883c66: JPEG image data, EXIF standard 2.21\n4:001c384e486a787bb376cee192ee763858e00274: JPEG image data, EXIF standard 2.21\n\nThen I am using Python to rename those files back to Jpeg or PNG files. There are not the same names as they were originally but this has been good enough. There is a Manifest.mbdb file in the same backup directory. I didn't have much time digging into it but this file looks like to contain information which one can use to restore all information.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Core 2 Duo won't install 64-bit OS X 10.7 I am trying to install OS X 10.7 x64 on my Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro from 2007. Before I was running OS X 10.6.8 x64 which worked fine, but I can't seem to install 10.7 as 64-bit. Somehow it assumes under the installation that it must be x86, since I am not asked which version I want to install.\nApple states that it should be able to run 64-bit (and since Snow Leopard was x64 I don't doubt it).\nI have checked for any firmware updates, but all seems to be up to date.\nHow can I get my machine to install the x64 version? Is there some way to force it?\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro has indeed a 64 bits processor but it has a 32 bits EFI. So without a hack you won't be able to boot the 64 bits kernel. (source) \n", "Q: OSX Mountain Lion - Remove shadows from Uncover Gesture I have a quick question. When utilizing the uncover window gesture (IE. move 3 fingers apart) to reveal the desktop there is a shadow which boarders the screen. \nI would like to know is there a way I can remove this shadow from appearing with an app or a script?\nPersonally without the shadow I believe the desktop provides a more elegant appearance.\n\nA: The purpose of the shadows is to show that you are temporarily pushing the content to the edges to \"clear some space\" over your desktop, presumably where you will then copy or rename a file or perform some other short action with one of your Desktop items.  It's existence signifies that you have plenty of windows open and ready to return to their previous on screen location at a gesture.\nIf you removed it, then it would look no different from a normal desktop with all apps minimised, or say a fresh desktop space within Mission Control, and how then would you be able to distinguish between the 2?\nObviously the above isn't necessarily an answer to your question (my answer would be \"There is no supported method of doing this nor am I aware of any defaults write style .plist edit that would hack it), but perhaps understanding the purpose of them more will enable you to put up with them better.\n", "Q: Unsupported hack or workaround to get 64-bit OS X to install on a MacBook Pro having only 32-bit EFI? I want to install the 64-bit OS X 10.7 on my MacbookPro 2,1, which has a 64-bit processor, but only 32-bit EFI and Kernel Boot mode.\nI know that this is not officially supported, but I assume there is some workaround since the hardware provides everything needed to run a 64-bit OS, except for the EFI.\n\"Select Startup Mode\" tells me, that: \"While your Mac is technically able to run a 64-bit kernel, this is not currently enabled by Apple.\"\nHow can I get that to work? Is there an unsupported hack or workaround?\n\nA: I found a post on the subject from the guy who wrote this book about Mac OS X internals.  His post mentions Snow Leopard (10.6), but the issues would be similar for 10.7. See Mac OS X Internals - Is Your Machine Good Enough for Snow Leopard K64?\nHere's the part I found most relevant to your question:\n\n[...] Unfortunately, a 64-bit processor alone doesn’t suffice. Out of the\nbox, boot.efi will not boot K64 even if you have a 64-bit processor\nand explicitly request K64 if at least one of the following is true.\n\n*\n\n*The machine has 32-bit EFI.\n\n*The machine’s model is prohibited from booting K64 through a hardcoded list within the boot loader. (A cursory look suggests that\nthe list excludes \"non-Pro\" machines.)\n\nBoth of these \"limitations\" are technically artificial, albeit to\ndifferent degrees.\nThe first limitation actually does have merit and is arguably not all\nthat artificial. Although a 32-bit EFI could launch a 64-bit kernel,\nthe kernel, when running, would not be able to use firmware services. [emphasis mine] \nIn particular, you wouldn’t have NVRAM. For kernel developers merely\nwanting to run a 64-bit kernel for testing and debugging, this may not\nbe an issue [...]\n\nOn the one hand, the author states that the limitations may be artificial, which still indicates some promise of a workaround, but on the other hand, as @Koen van Rhee's answer also already pointed out, you may end up with devices without support under 64-bit.\n(Aside: Why do you want to run the 64-bit kernel, anyway? The OS X 32-bit kernel can run 64-bit programs.)\nI did some more digging searching for a real workaround of some kind, not just theory.  I found the following: OS X Daily - Got an Older Mac? MLPostFactor Installs OS X 10.8.3 on Old Unsupported Macs.  OS X Daily's article links to a series of forum posts at MacRumors - [Guide] Success! Install 10.8 on old unsupported Mac.  It is a very long thread.\nI still don't definitively know if you can get the OS X 10.7 64-bit kernel running on your specific kind of Mac, but I suspect for the reasons mentioned in this image from the MacRumors forum thread that you can't: \"Problem is cards like [...] Does NOT have 64-bit Kexts [...] 64-Bit Kernel will NOT load these 32-bit kexts\".  Essentially, what @Koen van Rhee already said.\nBut then I found this. Quoting: \"Apple has included 64-bit drivers for GMA950 in the OS X 10.6.2 update. These drivers can be used to provide partial support for GMA950 under OS 10.8.\"  ... and I'm thinking: maybe such kexts exist for your card and might work on 10.7 too, if they'd work on 10.6 & 10.8? You may have to hunt and mix & match bits from elsewhere.\nTo sum up:  I don't believe there to be a single or simple workaround for your desired OS version and hardware version.  If you want to proceed, everything I've read indicates it may be possible (to some degree — accept there may be missing drivers and so missing functionality and/or poor performance), but your work will be cut out for you.\n\nA: I could see how there would be a possibility to work around this. I assume this would come from the hackintosh community.\nHowever.. You might be able to run a barebones version of the OS but then run into trouble with drivers. An example would be the graphics card. It's a GMA 950 right? As far as I know Apple never released 64bit drivers for it. So even if you get this running, you would still have only basic video without acceleration.\nReference: http://netkas.org/?p=189 \n", "Q: Retina Macbook Pro 15'' overheating? I got this RMBP mid 2012.

Even if you installed something like ClickToPlugin, which replaces YouTube's Flash app with QuickTime and is more efficient, the computer should still be fairly warm or borderline hot.\nYou should use something like gfxCardStatus to verify whether any of the open apps are forcing a switching to the Nvidia GPU. If there is one issue that is often associated with high temperatures and fast battery drainage, this would be it. Try closing the affected app and see if things improve, and then try figuring out a way to avoid the GPU switch (which may entail replacing the app by another one which is better behaved with respect to GPU switching).\n", "Q: How can I use a different Apple ID to upload Apps How can I use a different Apple ID to upload my Apps to iTunesConnect?\nThe Apple ID that I use as Developer Account is also in use for uploading iBooks into iTunesConnect and can't be used to upload Apps anymore.\nIs there a way to assign another Apple ID as developer account or to upload the Apps?\n\nA: Yes - this is covered in the iTunes Connect guide under setting up user accounts:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/SettingUpUserAccounts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH25-SW1\n", "Q: More colors than ls -G in file extensions In the output of ls -G, I can see some extensions get colors like symbolic links or .sh files. What if I also want .jpg, .xml, .wav or .log to have different colors too?\nAlso, is there any way I can set the color extensions list and set separate colors for different extensions?\n\nA: The colors used by ls -G are based on the file attributes (like directory, symbolic link, executable and so on). See man ls and go to the section on the LSCOLORS environment variable for the list of color values and the order of file attributes to define the colors for each file attribute.\nYou cannot change the colors by file extension by default.

To quit an application, click the  menu on the toolbar (top), and then select Quit. If you cannot quit an application or do not know how, hold down the Command and Option keys, and then press Esc on your keyboard. Select the application in the Force Quit Application window, and then select Force Quit. Click Force Quit to quit the application.\nNote You cannot quit Finder.\nWhen you are finished, click the red close button in the upper-left corner to close the window.\nFore Quit Applications window\nStep 2: Determine the amount of space available on the hard disk\nBefore you perform any database maintenance, make sure that you have at least three times as much hard disk space available as the current size of your Outlook identity. For example, if the identity is 1 gigabyte (GB), there should be at least 3 GB of free space available on the hard disk (not including the space that is needed for virtual memory).\nTo determine the size of your identity, follow these steps:\nn the Finder, click Go, and then click Home. Open the Documents folder.\nOpen the Microsoft User Data folder.\nOpen the Office 2011 Identities folder.\nClick the Identity folder.\nOn the File menu, click Get Info, and then click Get Information. Note the size of the database. \n\nWhen you create an Outlook identity, hard disk space is allocated for the data that the identity receives as you work. When you add and delete messages, appointments, tasks, and notes, the database can develop wasted space.\nStep 3: Discover and back up the current identity\nTo back up your identity, follow these steps:\nIn the Finder, click Go, and then click Home. Open the Documents folder.\nOpen the Microsoft User Data folder.\nControl-click or right-click the Office 2011 identities folder, and then select Duplicate. A copy of the folder is created.\nQuit all applications. \n\nYou have created a backup of your identity (or identities) and are ready to continue.\nNote This backup can be used by third-party database recovery software, which generally work better on non-rebuilt identities.\nStep 4: Rebuild the database\nQuit all applications.\nHold down the Option key on the keyboard, and then start Outlook 2011.\n\nNote You can also browse to the Database Utility by opening the Application folder and then opening the Microsoft Office 2011 folder. Open the Office folder, and then double-click Microsoft Database Utility.app.\nIn the Database Utility window, select the database that you want to maintain, and then click Rebuild.\nThe Rebuilding Main Identify window will open and show the progress. When the operation is completed, you will receive the message \"Your database was rebuilt successfully.\"\nClick Done. \n\nSelect an identity\nStart Outlook and see whether the problem is resolved. If the problem is not resolved, go to the next step.\nStep 5: Create a new identity\nIf you are using Outlook in more than one capacity, such as at home and at work, Outlook may be configured to have multiple identities. Each identity stores separate sets of e-mail, address books, tasks, calendars, account settings, and more.\nIf Outlook has multiple identities, one of the identities might be damaged. Try to use a different identity to determine whether this is the problem. If an identity is damaged, you must create a new identity to resolve this problem.\nTo create a new identity, follow these steps:\nQuit all applications.\nHold down the Option key on the keyboard, and then click the Outlook icon in the dock. The Microsoft Database Utility will open.\n\nNote You can also access the Microsoft Database Utility by opening the Application folder and then opening the Microsoft Office 2011 folder. Open the Office folder, and then double-click Microsoft Database Utility.app.\nClick the plus [+] sign to add a new identity, and then type a name for the new identity. For example, type New identity.\n\nCreate a new identity\nSet the newly create identity as the default. To do this, select the newly created identity, click the Action button, and then select Set as Default.\n\nSet an identity as the default\n\nQuit the Microsoft Database Utility, and then restart Outlook and see whether the problem is resolved.\n\nIf the previous steps did not resolve the issue, the Outlook database most likely is damaged beyond repair. If there are no viable backups available and there are no other sources of the data (such as another computer or a handheld device), you will have to start from scratch because the data is not recoverable. To start from scratch, you have to drag the Office 2011 Identity folder (only if there are no other identities) to the Trash, and then restart Outlook. \n\nA: Microsoft released patch for this \nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49183\nI found out about this from this article. \n", "Q: New HD - Mid 2007 MacBook - Wrong OS Disk I am trying to install a new hard drive in a MacBook from mid-2007. (Original question re: drive replacement here)\nI have managed to install the physical drive, and format it ready for the installation of the OS. (Map Scheme: GUID partition table; Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled))\nNow it's telling me \"Mac OS X cannot be installed on this computer\". I'm satisfied that the hard drive is fine. And from what I can tell, the OS CD I've been given is not the one that came with the macbook originally.\nI put the last three digits of the serial number into the EveryMac website, and it came up with this result: Apple MacBook \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.16 13\" (White)\nThis is how I knew it was a \"mid-2007\" model.\nThen I looked at Apple KB article HT1159 regarding about what version of OS X shipped with each MacBook. For \"Mid 2007\", it tells me 10.4.9 or 10.4.10 is included when the Mac was shipped.\n\nWhen I tried booting from the install CD, I closed the error message and looked at the name of the CD in the drive via Utilities → Startup Disk and it tells me \"Mac OS X 10.5.2\".\n\n\n*\n\n*So, are all my assumptions above correct?\n\n*Can Mac OS X 10.5.2 be installed on this MacBook?\n\n*If yes, then is my issue something else other than incompatible software?\n\n*If not, will I need to find the original CDs that came with this specific Mac to continue?\n\nA: Your MacBook should be able to run 10.5.x - to be precise it should run anything up to OSX Lion (10.7.5).\nThe way to install it is by using a retail version of the OS you want to install. If the DVD is e.g. for an iMac you won't be able to install from that on your MacBook, even though its the same OS.\nTry downloading an image of the version you want from Apple and then follow these instructions: http://www.macworld.com/article/1161069/make_a_bootable_lion_installer.html\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Is there any way to print to an old Diablo-command-set parallel printer from a modern Mac?

When I update or amend a file, I find myself having to manually copy and paste to replace the same files in all the other projects that rely on the same file(s). \n\nA: What you are describing might be accomplished with a hard link.\nHard links mean that one file on the drive is seen as a file in multiple folders.\nSo, if you had a file recipe.doc and stored in your ~/Documents folder, you could hard link it elsewhere - perhaps /Users/Shared and ~/Projects/Cooking/Pasta/recipe.doc\nSo, the link count would be 3 for that file and only one recipe would take space on the disk. If you deleted the file in /Users/Shared - rather than deleting the file, it just removes that one link and decrements the file counter to 2. When the last link goes away, you have a link count of 1 and the file remains, but no copies in other folders.\nIf you want to learn more, the link command is a terminal command written as ln.\nAlso, you could check that file into some sort of code control system like git and script the checkout in the folders of your liking. It really depends on how much time you'll save or if you just want to write a quick and dirty shell script to push the changed file elsewhere (or use rsync to copy just the changed bits and be über efficient).\n\nA: Theoretically you could use Folder Actions to watch for changes on shared files and copy them over to all the other projects/folders. In practice this will not really work because Folder Actions tend to be not very reliable. I found that Hazel works quite well for this though, a lot of stuff can be automated that way.\n\nDepending on your requirements you may also want to think about structuring your files differently because duplicating files will lead to problems especially if you use version control, work in larger setups or if several people are involved. So instead of having several projects in a structure like\n+ project-1\n  + common-file-1\n  + common-file-2\n  + specific-file-1.1\n  + specific-file-1.2\n+ project-2\n  + common-file-1\n  + common-file-2\n  + specific-file-2.1\n  + specific-file-2.2\n\nand probably building/packaging them from there you could switch to something like\n+ common\n  + common-file-1\n  + common-file-2\n+ project-1\n  + src\n    + specific-file-1.1\n    + specific-file-1.2\n  + build\n\nand then use a build script in project-1 to copy all the relevant files from common and project-1/src into project-1/build for further use. It may take some effort to change your current structure into something like that but it might bring benefits on the long run. If you want to dig depper into this, Pragmatic Project Automation is a good place to start with.\n", "Q: Download and view podcast If I download a free podcast onto my iTunes and onto my iPhone does it still use data from my contract?\n\nA: Downloading podcasts to iTunes on your computer and syncing it from there to your iPhone (via cable or WiFi) does not require a 3G/LTE connection, so you should be fine.\n", "Q: Does Battery Usage/Percentage need to be calibrated again? I recently installed iOS 7 on an iPhone 4S. Does the Battery Usage/Percentage (as shown in the top-right corner of the screen of the phone) need to be calibrated again (by letting the battery fully discharge once, possibly to be followed by a full charge and a hard reboot)? Or is this nonsensical advice?\n\nA: Discharging the battery once in a while (every few Months) is not a must but does help calibrating, for the system to be more accurate waring you on low levels.\nOver time charging and discharging creates a more inaccuracy of the actual level. For example if you plug in at 40%, unplug at 80% and so on.\nThe reason is that the system uses the last known battery charge to produce the %, thus assumes the battery charge level.\nHowever if the battery was not discharged for long time, the remaining charge could be wrong (due to batter aging).\nDischarging to not less than 20% once in a while helps the accuracy.\nSince there is a opposite effect (to frequent full discharge) will shorten the battery life, you should only do this every few months.\n", "Q: How do I get photos from my iphone to the iPad in my husbands name via icloud Our iPad is in my husbands name, but I have a new iphone.

But the display is completely black, doesn't even turn on or flash.\nWhat do you think can be done to fix it?\nThank you.\n\nA: I have had a similar issue a few weeks ago. In my case the screen was not \"completely\" black, but it was close. Going to the \"Display\" tab in the settings app and turning up the brightness did the trick.\nHowever, it may also be an actual hardware failure if there is nothing at all visible on the screen. In that case you should take the display to an Authorized Apple Service center.\nIn the pulldown, select Mac repair since these require the same training, tools and skill to repair as an iMac does.\n\nA: My Thunderbolt cable was recently diagnosed as the cause of a 'dark' display. Like you, I have basic secondary features -- such as the Thunderbolt display bridging my MacBook pro over to the LAN.  So consider a) getting a new cable; b) wiping any dirt accumulation in the cable or interface.\n\nA: I had this issue. For me the fix was to leave the display unplugged from the power for a few minutes. It came back to life after that. I did also blow into the cable in case there was dust inside. The PRAM reset had no effect\n\nA: In case somebody is here with the same issue I had...\nI had a brand new 27\" Thunderbolt display, it replaced my previous one.  Came out of box DOA.  No power, no show in \"display\" settings.  Tried on Mac Mini, and MacPro (late 2013).  Tried the Command+Option+P+R key combo and did the reset there, but it did not work.  Tried unpower for 30 minutes, many many attempts....\nJust about to give up and rebox for another trip to a service center.  Then I found a list of startup shortcut keys.  One of the ones on the list was just pressing the \"D\" key during boot up.  I did a shutdown, put back on the Thunderbolt display (was using an old HDMI screen to run the mac temporily) booted MacPro once the 'start up ding happened' I hit the D key and held it.  Seconds later 'BAM!'  I got the screen showing me a shutdown/restart and a login screen (slightly different from normal, but similar to login), after reboot its back up and going again.  Hope this stays that way.\nHopefully someone who has a similar issue can get going this way too.\n\nA: Black screen issue resolved... I purchased a fully working and tested used Thunderbolt monitor yesterday. Everything worked fine at the store when tested on a MBP that is identical to my own. \nAt home, the screen would not come to life and remained black even though it was available in System Preferences. I could also mouse over to the black screen. So clearly it was recognized, just no display. \nAfter trying a new Thunderbolt cable, resetting PRAM, restarting my MBP multiple times and unplugging and plugging in the Tbolt cable (original and the new one) with no luck, I plugged the power directly into the wall. The screen flickered a bit so I knew I was onto something. A few more times switching between wall power and surge protector and the display finally came to life. I have the Thunderbolt plugged directly into the wall now which is not ideal, but hey - at least it works.\nSo, not exactly steps you can follow directly, but it does prove that these monitors are glitchy but can be resurrected. Frustrating! At least I'm in business now and I hope you're as lucky.\n\nA: You could use a Thunderbolt cable to connect to the display Thunderbolt port. That should let you know if it's a cable issue or a display issue.\n\nA: I had this issue and tried all of the suggestions here, and on many other threads. Reset SMC, PRAM, tried different computer, cable, brightness settings, etc. I also tried unplugging it and leaving it for a few minutes. Nothing I did would wake the display up. The display was detected: I could hear music through the speakers; I could see the preferences and adjust them; the only issue was that it was not showing the video signal. Last night I had given up and started looking for a new display, a Dell or something. So I unplugged my Thunderbolt display and went to bed.\nThis morning, I plugged it back in and tried again - it came to life immediately! Inexplicably.\nSo, I have arrived at the conclusion that the inherent problem with these displays is related to temperature. It's hot here at the moment, and my office is not air conditioned. The back of the display is also pointing out of the window at the morning sun. These displays have fans inside, so need to be running as cool as possible; I think they need to be turned off completely now and again, and cooled down sufficiently.\nHope this helps someone. Please comment if this also fixed your 'dark screen' problem.\n", "Q: When reconnecting my laptop to an external monitor, the USB ports stop working To reproduce my problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up laptop (Macbook Pro, version 10.8.5) with it connected to an external monitor (Apple Thunderbolt Display) that has the mouse and keyboard connected to the USB ports on the external monitor. (At this point, USB mouse and keyboard still work fine)\n\n*Remove thunderbolt display cable from laptop.\n\n*Reconnect thunderbolt display cable, re-enabling external display.

I can't figure out how that would happen. A song will come on. I will go to my only playlist. It won't be there but it's still playing. Next week same thing. Makes  no sense. Help I hate his music!\n\nA: Playlists are just organized subsets of your music library, so you might not have the song on the playlist, but still have it in the collection.  Even if you just have a single playlist, that doesn't mean that every song on your phone is in it. iTunes will default to the first song alphabetically if you tell it to \"Play\" when it doesn't have a playlist loaded (i.e. the first time after turning on the phone).  \nAt least under iOS 6 (I haven't upgraded yet), you can see all songs by tapping the \"Songs\" tab at the bottom of the Music app.  If his music is there, you can delete it from there.

He was about to tell me I must have had some kind of stolen phone, but he did an extra check. I'm glad he did because he discovered that the computer chip had burnt somehow (he said there were burns all over the inside). He realized that this would cause it to wipe its own policy as a kind of fail safe against further use, and without that there is no way my phone would activate. I'm actually glad this happened, who knows if the chip would have kept deteriorating or what. He told me he had never seen this happen before, and it sure seemed to stump the reps I was on the phone with, too.

Turning data roaming off, indeed just turning data off (if you are not currently roaming and merely want to prove this) should still allow you to send and receive SMS messages as these are sent through the voice connection, not the data one - it's exactly how phones have always been able to send a text before anyone ever had data connections.\nSo the problem is almost certainly something to do with your config or usage, rather than how the SMS systems works.

THE QUESTIONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make my MacBook Pro automatically mount a network share when it wakes up?\n\n*How can I make sure that when it is mounted it is mapped to the same path (/Volumes...)\n\n\nMY SETUP:\nI have a MacBook Pro running the latest OS X, and I also have a NAS in the house. From Finder I connected the NAS to my MacBook, and it shows up in the shared drives on the Finder bar together with all the other links (like Desktop, All my files...etc.). I also have a password saved in my keychain, so I do not have to type it in.\nTHE PROBLEM IN DETAIL:\nThis network share is not mounted automatically, i.e. I have to click on the link in Finder to get it mounted (on /Volumes/...), otherwise other programs do not see it. When my MacBook sleeps it will be automatically dismounted though but not mounted again when I wake the computer up. Even worse, after manual mounting with a click in Finder, the path at /Volumes will be a different one, so some programs lose the path.\nWHY IT IS ANNOYING:\nA prime example is Adobe Lightroom (LR):  I keep lots of photos on the NAS share, and LR add these photos to its database found on the MacBook's local drive. But it does not copy the files over from the network share just links to each of them and generates a (much smaller size) thumbnails. Now when the MacBook wakes up, and I go to LR, the drive does not exist, it is not mounted. I have to go to finder, click and mount it, then back to LR where now I can see it. But sometimes the mounting associates the share with a new path, so the old share show lost links in the database, and I have to re-add the photos to LR, under the new path, just to lose it again next time when the Mac sleeps.\nThis must be an issue for others too, anybody figured it out?\n\nA: The answer somewhat depends on how the drive is being mounted in the first place.\nFor example, my AirPort Extreme has a USB drive attached. The Drive Name is 'CrashPlanExtreme' and the AirPort Extreme is (un-creatively) called \"Airport-Extreme.local.\" so I can mount the drive using this command:\nopen afp://Airport-Extreme.local./CrashPlanExtreme\n\nHowever, I think I had better success with this:\nopen -g -a Finder \"afp://Airport-Extreme.local./CrashPlanExtreme\"\n\nIt would be helpful if you mount the drive manually, then go to Terminal.app and enter this command:\nmount | egrep '^/'\n\nthen add the output to your question.\nOnce we determine the correct Terminal command to mount the drive, the rest is simply a matter of writing a script that runs when you log in (easily accomplished using launchd) and when the computer wakes from sleep (easily accomplished using the free and excellent sleepwatcher.)\n\nA: If the Network-Attached Storage (NAS) supports Server Message Block (SMB), you can use autofs to map a folder to the network drive. This will provide a reliable mount point that automatically mounts and unmounts as needed.\nI put together a script to help set this up at https://github.com/grahammiln/setup-autofs.\n", "Q: How do I drill in to calendar information from the notifications screen on iOS7?

Battery degradation is just a fact of owning a laptop and not something to be terribly worried about.\nEDIT: Apple support website says this:\nOccasionally, the battery may not show a full charge (100%) in OS X, even after the power adapter has been connected for an extended period of time. The battery may appear to stop charging between 93 percent and 99 percent. This behavior is normal and will help to prolong the overall life of the battery.\n", "Q: iphone 4 update to ios 7 failed - cycles in and out of restart screen IOS7 appears to have been installed on my Iphone 4.

Is it possible to have my MacBook become an iBeacon?\nI would like it to broadcast itself to iOS devices which support iBeacons. If this is possible, what are the hardware requirements of the computer (e.g. is Bluetooth 4.0 enough?), and how would I do it?\nUpdate: I am primarily looking for a way to do this without any additional hardware (since my MacBook already has Bluetooth built-in).\n\nA: If you are a programmer I have posted instructions on how to use a MacBook with Mavericks as an iBeacon.  You can find the instructions on my blog at http://www.blendedcocoa.com/blog/2013/11/02/mavericks-as-an-ibeacon/\nIf/When I get a chance I may create an app that you can use to advertise an iBeacon.\nThis is the answer I gave to a similar question on Stack Overflow \n\nMavericks doesn't have the iBeacon support in Core Location that was added to iOS 7.  However, Mavericks does now have the ability to act as an BLE peripheral device.  Given that an iBeacon is basically a peripheral it should be (and indeed is) possible to use Mavericks as an iBeacon.\nIn order to create an iBeacon on iOS you first create a CLBeaconRegion object and then use the peripheralDataWithMeasuredPower: method to get an NSDictionary containing the necessary advertisement data to broadcast.  If you take the contents of this NSDictionary from an iOS device and use it on Mavericks then you get an iBeacon.\nI have created a class to make this easier and allow you to generate the advertisement data dictionary directly on Mavericks.  The source code is available at https://github.com/mttrb/BeaconOSX\nThe BLCBeaconAdvertisementData class take the proximityUUID, major, minor and calibrated power values and creates an NSDictionary that can be passed to the startAdvertising: method of CBPeripheralManager on Mavericks.\nThe BLCBeaconAdvertisementData class is quite simple.  The main work is done by the following method:\n- (NSDictionary *)beaconAdvertisement {\n    NSString *beaconKey = @\"kCBAdvDataAppleBeaconKey\";\n\n    unsigned char advertisementBytes[21] = {0};\n\n    [self.proximityUUID getUUIDBytes:(unsigned char *)&advertisementBytes];\n\n    advertisementBytes[16] = (unsigned char)(self.major >> 8);\n    advertisementBytes[17] = (unsigned char)(self.major & 255);\n\n    advertisementBytes[18] = (unsigned char)(self.minor >> 8);\n    advertisementBytes[19] = (unsigned char)(self.minor & 255);\n\n    advertisementBytes[20] = self.measuredPower;\n\n    NSMutableData *advertisement = [NSMutableData dataWithBytes:advertisementBytes length:21];\n\n    return [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:advertisement forKey:beaconKey];\n}\n\nI have a more detailed blog post about this at http://www.blendedcocoa.com/blog/2013/11/02/mavericks-as-an-ibeacon/\n\nA: 1) You would need to obtain a bluetooth 4.0 BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) transmitter/receiver chipset to attach to/install in your MacBook.\nThis would allow you to transmit the beacon signal.\n2) You would need to create or purchase software that could use the chipset appropriately. \nThis would allow you to recognize the presence of nearby beacon-enabled devices, such as the new iPhones, and interact with them appropriately.\nHere's a site that explains more about iBeacons and BLE with some good example videos (actually linked to from 'iBeacon' in the original question):\nApple's iBeacons explained - What it is and why it mtters - Pocket-lint\nHere is a link to a company selling BLE transmitter/receivers for use commercially (mentioned in the article above). This site also provides an overview as to how the technology works:\nEstimote Beacons - real world context for your apps\nThis site gives details on BLE:\nLow Energy | Bluetooth Technology Website\nThen I'd say, put on your engineering hat and start searching for chipsets and software solutions!\nHave fun!\nEdit:\nAnother name for BLE is Bluetooth Smart. Search for hardware and/or software that is Bluetooth Smart (does BLE only) or Bluetooth Smart Ready (does both legacy bluetooth and BLE). Some lists are on the Bluetooth Technology Website (same as above), and a Google search brings up a few apps that have already been created.\nAnother search brings up a document for Apple developers:\nApple's Bluetooth Design Guidelines (from their developer center)\nand a rapid development tool for Apple developers (from bluetooth.org):\nApple Developers | Bluetooth Development Portal\n\nA: I have been using a small tool called MactsAsBeacon.

They are not using data roaming on their iPhone, but occasionally grab some hotel of coffee shop WiFi.\nI have a problem communicating with them that is essentially as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*When they message me using a data connection, I get an iMessage as I should\n\n*If they are still on the data connection when I reply, they will receive it\n\n*If they are not on a data connection, it will sent to me via SMS\n\n*When I reply to that SMS, I know that they have left their iPad turned on at home, and thus all messages shows as delivered because they are getting to that device first, and not to her phone, ergo I cannot text her\n\n\nIs there a way I can force a message to be sent to a recipient as an SMS message if they have their phone number configured to be a receiving address on a second device that is active and therefore receiving the messages over data first?\n\nA: Anyone that had an iPhone can now de-register that phone number from iMessage delivery at https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage\nIn the past, you had to know to turn off iMessage before you removed the SIM from the device to accomplish the same thing, but clearly enough people needed this that it's a self-serve option now from Apple to manage your iMessage status.\nThen you can choose to SMS them or iMessage them and know when the iMessage is really landing at a device that's capable of replying to it. It doesn't perfectly solve your case, but for many it will be an ideal way to get messages reliably from non-iPhone devices.\n\nA: The possible solution for this is turn your network off for a moment, and try sending it as an SMS, if it goes good, else hold the blue bubble for a second and tap on \"Send as Text Message\".

My IT department has this great idea: if you want to read your work email on your personal device, you have to give us total access to the device. Well, no. It's my personal device, you can't have it. So I can't have work email.\nThen I discover there are apps for Android that really don't care what my IT dept thinks, and they connect to Exchange for the emails anyway. Then I discover Mail+, which does the same thing in iOS: Connecting to my company's Exchange server without the profiles installed, and allowing me access to my work email.\nMy question is this: How are these apps connecting to the Exchange server? What is different about the way the iPhone connects with native email accounts? Is there a way to make the native accounts work without the profiles installed by my IT dept?\n\nA: There are certainly a lot of variables here, some are.\nThe way traffic is 'managed' on the network that you are on.\nThere are many ways an IT department could prevent their network participants from accessing certain resources, I will explain a few.\nDHCP & DNS.\n  Your specific device may be configured by reserved DHCP to use a different DNS server than everyone else. This may prevent external email services (possibly OpenDNS). You could try manually configuring your DNS to 8.8.8.8 (Googles service) and test again. \n *This will still fail if for instance the IT department have also restricted DNS traffic on port 53 to their own DNS service exclusively.\nLevel 7 Firewall capability.\n  A firewall can specifically see email traffic and through the creation of rules 'shape' traffic to fit an IT policy. This firewall could then 'see' Apple mail type conversation and block it, another email application may not behave the same way therefore failing to trigger the 'shape' match and ignoring it.\nMail servers can also be configured to use custom configurations, alternative port's could be used or your application may even use a proxy service or VPN (that could be hardcoded into the app)\nThat said and if your specific corporate IT policy permits, you could always 'investigate' using a VPN of your own if you wanted to 'experiment' (internet search 'personal vpn service') This would enclose your port 25 activity within a VPN tunnel.\nIncidentally, I think it's worth mentioning.  When your IT department ask for you to accept an Android or iOS device management policy, they do not actually have access to your personal email accounts. They can enforce certain policies, for instance forcing a device to have a lock code, password complexity, length. Other capabilities depend on the device but neither currently have native support for location tracking.\n", "Q: How to monitor CPU core usage? I have a Macbook Pro 15\" with the quad core i7.

To that end I thought Activity Monitor might be able to show how many cores are being utilized while I run through various tasks (VMWare, Photoshop, etc ..). \nDoes anyone know how to display core usage via Activity Monitor?\n\nA: There are few ways to view the CPU usage in Activity monitor.\n\nThis one is the Dock\n\nThose are in the Activity Monitor\nYou can also set it up as Floating window so it will be on top so you can see real time what is happening.\n\nA: You can get a graph per core to show by going to Window on the menu bar and selecting Cpu Usage or Cpu History. There is also an option under the View menu to place a similar graph in Activity Monitor's dock icon.\nIf you're using a reasonably new Mac, Hyper Threading is enabled, so you'll see twice as many graphs as you have physical cores.\n", "Q: Mountain Lion auto closing apps When do some apps (like preview) auto close when I stop giving them focus? Whats the difference between those and others that don't close?\nthanks\n\nA: Quoting from this typically comprehensive Ars Technica article:\nhttp://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/8/\n\nLion will quit your running applications behind your back if it decides it needs the resources, and if you don't appear to be using them. The heuristic for determining whether an application is \"in use\" is very conservative: it must not be the active application, it must have no visible, non-minimized windows—and, of course, it must explicitly support Automatic Termination.\nAutomatic Termination works hand-in-hand with autosave. Any\n  application that supports Automatic Termination should also support\n  autosave and document restore. Since only applications with no visible\n  windows are eligible for Automatic Termination, and since by default\n  the Dock does not indicate whether or not an application is running,\n  the user might not even notice when an application is automatically\n  terminated by the system. No dialog boxes will ask about unsaved\n  changes, and when the user clicks on the application in the Dock to\n  reactivate it, it should relaunch and appear exactly as it did before\n  it was terminated.\n\n\nA: Applications like Preview support automatic termination.\nIf for example you open Preview, open at least one window in it, close all windows, and focus another application, Preview is hidden from the Dock and the application switcher. The process is not actually terminated, but there might be some changes in how it is managed.\nI don't know if there are some situations where processes that support automatic termination are actually terminated, but things might change in future versions of OS X. The Mac App Programming Guide does say that programs are actually terminated:\n\nAutomatic termination eliminates the need for users to quit an app. Instead, the system manages app termination transparently behind the scenes, terminating apps that are not in use to reclaim needed resources such as memory.\n\nYou can disable automatic termination (or automatic hiding from the Dock and the applications switcher) by enabling NSDisableAutomaticTermination:\ndefaults write -g NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool true\n\n", "Q: No GDB in the new Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode - September 2013?

Release when you see the gray Apple icon and a spinning-gear loading icon.\nOnce loaded, open a Finder window and press Cmd-Shift-G. Type in “~/Library/Caches” minus the quotation marks to go to the caches folder.\nRemoving these might work, but deleting the cache is generally inadvisable. Instead, try saving a backup of all the cache files before deleting them. This way, if something happens, you can restore the old files.\nFinally reboot the computer.\nFind the Bad Preference File:\nThis one is much more tedious and time-consuming, but it’s better than having a broken computer. Reboot into Safe Mode, open a Finder window, press Cmd-Shift-G, and go to ~/Library/Preferences.\nFrom there, start moving preference files somewhere else (like the desktop). Reboot and see if it’s fixed. If you think you know which app caused the problem, try starting there. If not… well, there are a lot of files to try.\nAppleCare:\nIf you have the AppleCare warranty, take your Mac along to the Genius Bat at your local Apple Store. Hopefully they will be able to sort things out in a short period of time (hopefully).\nJust maybe even if the computer is out of warranty, you may still be able to get it fixed (See How to Get Free Repairs Without a Valid Warranty).\nIf the worst comes to the worst.....\nHard Reset:\nThere’s always the nuclear option. Restart your computer and hold Cmd-R as it boots. Make sure you’re connected to the internet via WiFi or Ethernet cable, choose the menu option to reinstall OS X and follow the installer from there.\nAlways:\nBe prepared. Regularly back up your files, keep a spare administrator account, and have a spare machine to look up fixes if something happens.\n\nA: For root password recovery on Unix like systems, one is advised to perform recovery using single user mode, which is available on osx as well, I would use this:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1492\nThe other thing I would advise all users is to make sure that they don't just have one admin account, I always have a backup (completely standard admin account) for emergencies when my primary account becomes corrupt (or if for some reason I cannot remember my main password and cannot retrieve or access my password store/secure keychain.\n", "Q: What to do about broken WiFi on iPhone 4S after iOS 7 update? Several iPhone 4S owners have noticed a problem with their WiFi not working after upgrading to iOS 7.\nIt appears to be both a software problem (our phones have been working for nearly two years with WiFi being just fine before the upgrade) and hardware problem (it gets partially better when the iPhone is chilled (physically).\nMy particular symptoms:\niPhone boots off spontaneously.\nDiagnostics showing several panics with a debugger message of \"WDT timeout\" or \"panic\" listing kernel_task as the panicked task.\nWiFi switch is disabled and set to \"Off\", can only be enabled by refridgerating the iPhone and rebooting (possibly needing to reset network settings).\nWhen WiFi can be enabled, it repeatedly drops the signal.\nIf the iPhone isn't cool, Settings freezes up in the WiFi settings and, to a lesser amount, in the Cellular settings.\nOnce the iPhone warms up, the problems begin anew.\nSo the question is what can we practically do now? Is there any use calling Apple support (for out of warranty devices), should we take it in to an Apple store (for a not-too-expensive repair), should we take it to a local phone reapir shop (is this the type of thing they can repair and what does that usually cost/how long does it take), is there any reason to expect a software fix, or need we basically resort to exchanging our phones in for new ones?\n\nA: I say give Apple a shot. I've been successful in resolving similar upgrade issues by calling the support number or making a Genius Bar appointment.\nLocal repair shops are fine for fixing a hardware component (i.e. replacing a screen) but not much help for an iOS software problem. Also see ifixit.com for DIY hardware repairs. They are amazing.\n\nA: I tried everything including changing the name on my iPhone 5 to remove the apostrophe, soft reset, resetting network settings, resetting all settings, resetting my router, manually entering my router information, installing the bug fix update, and two hard resets (factory reset) in a row out of desperation.  None of it worked, my iPhone will not connect to wifi so it is virtually useless as anything other than to make calls with.  I am dropping it off in the mail to Apple.  Hopefully they can fix this issue.  In the meantime I am left feeling very burned by the iOS 7 update.  Good luck!  \n\nA: Personally I have had this issue. \nMy situation was that I had multiple Apple Airport Express's using WDS to extend my network. I powered one of these down so I had only one access point hosting the wireless network. \nI then pin reset the device to factory settings. (see link)\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3728?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nIf you want to avoid a factory reset you could try degrading the connection (if it's not already) to something like 802.11b.\nMy particular situation improved when I disabled 802.11n, at least for the beta.\n", "Q: using windows 8, message says problem with this drive recently bought a new computer with windows 8. Installed ITunes and all my music is on the computer. When I plug in my Ipod classic to synch new music added I get the following message: There's a problem with this drive. Scan the drive now and fix it. I am a 65 year old that doesn't know what they want me to do. If I restore it to factory it will wipe all the music off of it right? Anything else I can do? I don't understand how to scan the drive and fix it. Thanks. Carol\n\nA: This problem occurs is most frequently because you didn't safe eject the device (in this case, your iPod) from your computer. The message will continue to appear every time you plug in your iPod until you click it (the message), and then click \"Scan and fix\". Windows will run a program called CHKDSK in the background, which will fix any problems with your iPod's storage. It's very unlikely that you will lose data when you do this as CHKDSK is specifically designed to find and fix problems with data.\nTo prevent the message occurring in future, you should safely eject the device. This basically lets the device know that you want to unplug it, so it can finish communicating with Windows and save any data to its storage. If you just pull the cable out without first telling the iPod what you're about to do, it might still be half-way through transferring some data. To safely eject the iPod, refer to this Apple Support article: http://support.apple.com/en-is/HT201646\nNote: Even if you weren't actually transferring data when you unplugged it, if you don't safely eject it, the device will know it wasn't correctly unmounted from the computer before being removed and will tell Windows next time you plug it in, causing that message to pop up. Also, unlike what angus batkin said, it's definitely not a bug in Windows.\n\nA: I've been getting this message with my brand new iPod classic too. I scanned it like it asked a couple times and nothing changes.\nI suspect its just a bug with windows 8, so as long as the iPod functions with iTunes then just ignore the message. If there is actually a problem with the device though, just click on the message box that pops up with the warning and it should bring up a small window to run a scan on the iPod.\n\nA: I've never disconnected my iPod without safely ejecting it. I got the \"There's a problem\" message and trouble syncing it. I tried a lot of different solutions that I found on the web. Here's what worked for me: Uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes. It sure beats having Windows try to scan and repair an Apple device (which I tried, but it didn't work).\n\nA: If you click on the blue message that says  'problem with this drive'.\nIt should then come up and say 'scan and fix recommended' or something like ignore or continue below it. Click ignore/continue and the ipod should just connect to itunes like normal.\n\nA: Either close the error popup box or click on \"Continue without scanning\". You can ignore the error. You do NOT need to factory restore your iPod.\nThe reason is probably that you didn't safely eject your iPod the last time you disconnected it from your computer. Safely eject is basically that your computer stops using the memory in the iPod. Before you disconnect it.\nIf you want to know how to eject your iPod safely, this article may help you: Link to article.\n", "Q: Can I still downgrade from iOS 6.1.3 to iOS 6.1.2 (iPhone 4)? I am trying to jailbreak a friend's 16GB iPhone 4. It's currently running iOS 6.1.3.\nI'm aware that you can't jailbreak 6.1.3, so I am attempting to downgrade to 6.1.2, however I am having an issue creating or finding SHSH blobs for redsn0w to complete the downgrade.\nAny assistance would be appreciated.\n\nA: As mentioned in the firmware signing status for iPhone 4, only iOS versions from 7 and up are being signed by Apple.\nIn order to use redsn0w to do a downgrade, you need the SHSH blobs saved for the specific version that you wish to downgrade to. In this case, it seems like they were never saved while the phone was on iOS 6.1.2. So you cannot create/retrieve them.\n\nA: A jailbreak now exists for all 6.1.x iOS versions: http://p0sixspwn.com/\nThere is very little reason to downgrade from one 6.1.x revision to another; doing so would actually cause you to lose out on some important security patches.\n\nA: You cannot downgrade right now, as Apple has stopped signing iOS below version 7 now. Your best, if you want to jailbreak, is then to wait till a stable release is given out.\n", "Q: Mac won't show screen Since the beginning of today, the time now being midday, I've been having issues with my MacBook Pro.

But recently it has starting coming back on almost right away, which I assume is from the vibration of the speaker nearby. Is there some sort of sensitivity adjustment to avoid the monitor from turning on (until I turn it on myself)?\n\nA: When you put the display to sleep, it turns back on when the computer detects a key press or mouse movement or mouse click. In your case, it seems like your speaker vibration is causing the mouse to move, and thus waking up the display. The best workarounds are to avoid mouse movement by moving the speaker away from the mouse or placing the mouse on a surface that absorbs the speaker's vibrations or reducing the speaker volume.\nNote that you could reduce the sensitivity of the mouse by going to System Preferences > Mouse and then selecting a slower Tracking speed. But this would also likely make your system difficult to use - you'd have to physically move the mouse farther to move the cursor by a particular distance on the screen - and you may have to switch between two levels of sensitivity (slow and faster) often if you're not happy with the slow tracking setting for normal use.\n", "Q: How can I lock my stolen iPhone?

AFAIK for a long term it is better to keep modern battery around 40%. I have seen that some other laptop manufacturers added feature to their drivers to prevent battery charging over certain level. Is there anything similar available for mac?\n\nA: The 40% charged state is applicable for Lithium-Ion batteries only if you're going to remove the battery and put it in long term storage without using it. Refer How to Prolong Lithium-based Batteries. In the case of MacBook models, Apple recommends storing the batteries at 50% charge if you do not plan to use it for more than six months.\nFor normal usage, Apple recommends that you run the laptop on battery once in a while and also do a full discharge and recharge to calibrate the battery (full discharge/recharge means running it down till the computer automatically goes to sleep or shuts down due to low battery and then recharging it completely to 100% in one go).\nApple laptop batteries - Standard Maintenance\n\nFor proper maintenance of a lithium-based battery, it’s important to keep the electrons in it moving occasionally. Apple does not recommend leaving your portable plugged in all the time. An ideal use would be a commuter who uses her notebook on the train, then plugs it in at the office to charge. This keeps the battery juices flowing. If on the other hand, you use a desktop computer at work, and save a notebook for infrequent travel, Apple recommends charging and discharging its battery at least once per month.\n\nSee Apple's guide on Notebook batteries for detailed information.\n\nA: Not to my knowledge. The MacBooks already do some management of charging, for example if the battery is almost full it will not start charging to 100%, to save charging cycles.\nAlso, to my knowledge modern batteries die by age, mostly independently to the charging and discharging cycles.

I cannot use the drive of the MacBook to install onto the hard drive of the G5 because of an error that appears along the lines of \"10.3 cannot be installed on this machine\", I assume it's because of the Intel/PPC difference.\nSo I then restored the disk to a partition of the HDD from the G5 thinking I could 'boot' from that partition and then install.\nThat also failed, the disk was recognised but when selected a \"no entry\"-like symbol displayed in the middle of screen and nothing happened until the fans went into tornado mode.\nI have a PPC G5, an A1181 MacBook, Firewire cable and the OS X install disk.\nEDIT: The MacBook is running Leopard.\nI just tried this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4177625?start=0&tstart=0\nAnd the same thing happened as before: I can see the disk but when selected the Apple logo turns into a \"no entry\" type sign\n\nA: There has to be a typo in the OPs question that can only be corrected by the OP:\nThe error message \"10.3 cannot be installed on this machine\" is out of place there.\nTo install OS X (maxing out at OS X Leopard 10.5.8) you have several options regarding the DVD: \n\n\n*\n\n*clean the DVD drive in the G5, the lens might just be dirty\n\n*clean the Installation DVD, the DVD might just be dirty, slightly scratched\n\n*get another Leopard Installation DVD that doesn't have these flaws\n\n\nUsing the Firewire and Target Disk Mode route should be possible too. \nBut then there is the problem with \"PPC to Intel transition\": PPC machines boot from drives with an Apple Partition Map and Intel machines from an GUID partition map drive. \nThat prevents booting the G5 form a MacBook in Target Disk Mode or if you just swap the drives out; although the contents of 10.5 installations would be the same on both machines. Using a GUID formatted drive in a PPC machine is the most likely reason for the \"No-Entry\"-sign: there is just no disk available the PPC machine deems bootable.\nYou can therefore \n\n\n*\n\n*boot into Leopard on the MacBook, \n\n*mount the G5 in Target Disk Mode, \n\n*format the G5 drive with an Apple Partition Map\n\n*then install Leopard onto the G5 from the Macbook (this can be forced using Pacifist)\n\n\nThis describes the clean way.  \nAlternatively you could just clone the Leopard installation from the MacBook to the G5's drive. \n\nA: Try this: \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the MacBook into Target Disk Mode with the installation disk in it.\n\n*Boot the G5, holding the option key.\n\n*Look for the installer disk.\n\n*Install!\n\n\nI've done it this way on other machines that don't have usable optical drives.\nAn alternative is to use 10.6, rather than 10.5, because it is universal. 10.5 has two versions--one for PowerPC and one for Intel--but 10.6 only has one version that will work on BOTH architectures.\n", "Q: software to create timeline from excel data for mac I'm looking for a free or cheap product to create a timeline from an upload of an excel file, simple data (year and description).

When I plug it in to a charger, it goes \"buzz-buzz\". My iPad doesn't do this. Both behaviors are the same with iOS 6 and 7. \nHow do I make my phone not do that?\nI have checked the activity-specific sound settings (like Lock Sounds [off], etc). The main suspicious ones are Vibrate on ring and vibrate on silent. I would still like to have it buzz (vibrate) upon receiving texts, calls, and calendar alerts.\n\nA: There is no way to natively disable this other than turning off vibrations completely. Only your iPhone does this because the iPad (and the iPod touch) don't have vibrate motors.\nIf you jailbreak, there is a tweak called PowerSoundDisabler. It's a simple tweak to disable sound and vibration when respringing or plugging in via USB.\n\nA: Plug in your head phones into the phone, turn off silent mode and turn your headphones volume down.\nYou may also want to turn off vibrations in sounds then charge your phone! It will make no vibrations and if you put it back on mute, your phone won't vibrate as well :)\n\nA: *\n\n*Update to iOS 9.\n\n*Go to Settings, Sounds, Vibrate on Silent and deactivate it.\n\n\nA: To do this you will have to Jailbreak your phone.\n", "Q: Show package contents from command line When working at the terminal, I often use the open . command to open a finder window showing the current working directory. But if the current directory is actually a package, like a .app application or a .vmwarevm virtual machine, open . launches the application or the virtual machine instead.\nHow can I open a finder window showing the contents of a specified package?\nI’ve tried open -A /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app ., but that didn’t work.\n\nA: Using open -R for the first file in the bundle would work even if the bundle doesn't have a Contents directory:\nreveal() (\n  shopt -s nullglob\n  for f; do\n    a=(\"$f\"/*)\n    [[ -d $f && ${#a} != 0 ]] && open -R -- \"${a[0]}\" || open -R -- \"$f\"\n  done\n)\n\nIt might be easier to just type open -R and the path of some file inside the bundle though. You can bind menu-complete in .inputrc to make it easier to insert the path of the first file.\n\nA: You can simply cd into the package to open it in Terminal, then open Contents to open the contents in Finder.\nFor example, to open the contents of Safari.app in Finder, you can run the following:\ncd /Applications/Safari.app\nopen Contents\n\n\nA: open -R *\n\nopens the package in Finder.

I have no Dashboard icon in my Dock.\nHow can I put it on my Dock as there is no option to 'Keep in Dock' that I can find?\n\nA: Any app that is currently running can be pinned to the dock by right clicking it, and choosing keep in dock, but occasionally you find a program like Dashboard or Mission Control or Launchpad etc that overlays the dock area when running thus not letting you add it.  The simplest solution is to find the application within your /applications folder, and simply drag it to the dock, where it should add a suitable shortcut that stays put.\nHowever, I would generally advise for these sort of program that remembering the keyboard shortcut or trackpad gesture is often much faster and results in a less cluttered dock.\n", "Q: Why does my iOS device beep at noon every day? I have an iPod touch (4th gen). A few weeks ago, it started making an alert sound (tritone) every day at exactly 12 noon. There is no on-screen alert, nothing in the Notification Center pull-down. Just a sound. Every day.\nI have NO apps in my Notifications (Settings). I have NO alarms set. NO reoccurring calendar items.\nAnyone have a clue why my device is doing this?\n\nA: Under the app in the list, there should be a description of which types of notification an app can send.

They don't need the data plan however AT&T keeps adding on the data plan since they detect it being a smartphone.  Is there any way to avoid the plan, with this being a jailbroken iPhone?\n\nA: You'll have to change the IMEI to avoid the charge. There is simply no other way. As soon a phone connects to a network, the IMEI is registered and that's what carriers like AT&T use to determine if your device is a smartphone.\nYou can use ziphone to change the number but there's a lot of hurdles and provisos. As far as I know, that's the only JB program capable of doing it. Instructions are outline here: http://m.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=657\nThe Motorolla RAZR's IMEI: 358472042445412\nAnother alternative is to go to T-Mobile which don't have the Draconian charge. \n\nA: Unfortunately you are not the only victim.\nAT&T has a TOC that says if you use a smart phone on they network you will have to have a data plan. You do not have a choice here.\nNow, you can run but not hide, be aware that some other network providers do the same.\nDo not waist your time with Blocking it, or Removing it, or Killing it, or hiding you phone in a cave.\nThe will eventually charge you for a data plan if you use it or not, if you want it or not. It is a part of they cellular contract.\nSorry for the bad news :(\nSources:\nhttp://forums.att.com/t5/Data-Messaging-Features-Internet/Smart-Phone-without-data-plan-Possible/td-p/3522573\nhttp://www.att.com/shop/en/legalterms.html?toskey=wirelessCustomerAgreement#whatAreTheGenTermsApplyDataMsgPlans\nThe small print:\n6.3   What Are The Voice And Data Plan Requirements?\nA voice plan is required on all voice-capable Devices, unless specifically noted otherwise in the terms governing your plan.\nAn eligible tiered pricing data plan is required for certain Devices, including iPhones and other designated Smartphones. Eligible voice and tiered pricing data plans cover voice and data usage in the U.S. and do not cover International voice and data usage and charges. If it is determined that you are using a voice-capable Device without a voice plan, or that you are using an iPhone or designated Smartphone without an eligible voice and tiered data plan, AT&T reserves the right to switch you to the required plan or plans and bill you the appropriate monthly fees. In the case of the tiered data plan, you will be placed on the data plan which provides you with the greatest monthly data usage allowance. If you determine that you do not require that much data usage in a month, you may request a lower data tier at a lower monthly recurring fee.\nIn English, if you do not get the data plan your self (a cheep one) they will slap you with the most expensive data plan.\nJailbroken phone or not, there is no way around it as long you use the ATT network. Every call and text will broadcast the IMEI number. \nIf not already in they database, AT&T would only need to do a manual check on it.\nUPDATE as of March 8, 2014\nAT&T says it is cutting wireless data charges for individual customers who have no annual service contract - @Reuters\n\nA: I have no idea if that might work or not, being in Europe, but here's my suggestion.\nSupposing the data plan is activated as soon as a data connection is initiated, it might be enough to disable data connections from the iPhone's preferences.\nBut, and it is a big but, cell phone providers can identify your terminal even though its data connection is off (usually for innocent reasons like checking your phone is correctly configured). Since the contract plainly states that using an iPhone, or another smartphone (without mentioning the fact that said smartphone's data communication might be switched off) entitles AT&T to charge for data, my suggested solution might not work at all.\nBut it might be worth a try...\n", "Q: Can I use iOS 7 blocking to block iMessages between Apple IDs instead of phone numbers? I have iOS 7, which provides the ability to block calls and messages. Can I block someone texting me on iMessage from their Apple ID to my Apple ID? …or can I only block based on phone numbers (not Apple IDs)?\n\nA: Yes, on iOS 7, you can block someone from sending you an iMessage from their Apple ID. When you block a contact from sending you texts, it applies to SMS (sent to phone number) and iMessage (sent to phone/Apple ID email). Currently this works only on iOS devices. Any iMessages received on a Mac are not blocked.\nHow it works is described in detail here - Silence is Golden: A Guide to Blocking Calls and Texts in iOS 7\n\nWhat about texts?\nIf you’re sending a text, it will look like it was delivered. If you’re sending a message to someone who has blocked you, and you’re using iMessage, it will say “delivered” — exactly like a text that went through.\n\n", "Q: Menus don't respond on mouse hover I'm using OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5.

It would not be able to scan files downloaded from Safari, other apps, Mail, or anything else.\nBut that's ok.\nApple's sandbox limits malware\nThe sandbox also limits what any malware could do.  Since apps need to be signed, and the APIs they're allowed access to limit their access, there's not much room for a virus or other malware to sneak in.  Right now, there are no known iOS viruses.\n\nA: Due to application sandboxing in iOS, which restricts applications to just their individually allocated areas on the filesystem (and prevents access to any other application's or the OS' files as well as memory, network communication, etc.), an app written to be like an antivirus cannot really read anything outside of its own sandbox.\nDue to limited multitasking in iOS, an app written to be like an antivirus cannot really run in the background for a long time to scan the system continuously.\nBoth these factors together make it impossible to make an antivirus like app for iOS unless the device is jailbroken.\nAny antivirus, if at all deemed necessary, would have to be made by Apple. Third party app developers are limited to the restrictions mentioned above.\n\nFurther to the comments on the question, it may be worth one's while to look at this presentation titled \"The Android vs. Apple iOS Security Showdown - July 2012\" (especially slides #20 through #33).\n\nA: Intego which are famous for their security products for Mac, have an iOS App for iPad/iPhone:\nIntego VirusBarrier iOS offers on-demand scanning for your iPad or iPhone so you can catch any malicious files and get rid of them before they harm your computer or important files.\n", "Q: Stream iTunes to iPad I have a large library on my iTunes and I want to stream the sound to my iPad over wifi. I tested home sharing but it don't load the library, it blocks to the half (iOS 7) and it's quite long (nothing after 10mn). I also use Remote on my iPad to control my iTunes, but I can't get the sound from it…\nOn my Android I just use the Retune app to control iTunes (like Remote on iPad) and the georgous AirBubble app to receive stream from iTunes. But on an iPad? Why Apple doesn't permit to use AirPlay to do this? I don't want an Airport Express…\nPS: I also tested Airfoil but it's another app to launch on the Mac and I don't need it with my Android.\n\nA: If you have a large library, it will take a while for it to get the contents over Home Sharing, particularly depending on the wireless connection speed. Home Sharing is the expected way to do what you're trying to accomplish, simply let it finish doing the initial library transfer. If it's not giving an error, saying it is unable to connect or activate Home Sharing, then it is working.\nThe other options would be to sync the music to the iPad (wired or wirelessly), use iTunes Match to get the content directly (it, too will have to load the library data like Home Sharing does), or use a third-party method of sharing content from the computer to the iPad (like Plex).\nIt's also possible you're encountering network errors of some sort if you are receiving an error message of any kind (or if it succeeds but just takes a crazy long amount of time). It may help to review http://support.apple.com/kb/TS2972 or http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1629, depending on your network setup. Home Sharing requires UDP port 5353 to be open, which normally should not be an issue inside your network unless you have a very unusual setup.\n", "Q: How can I correct a wrong 'Personal Profile' address when enrolling in Apple Developer Program? When enrolling in the iOS Developer Program as an individual, I reach a step \"Review your enrollment information & submit\". It shows an old address of my under \"Personal Profile\". You can see the old address (Durham, NC) below.\n\nI logged into My Apple ID to correct my old home address, yet My Apple ID shows an updated (correct) primary address. You can see the correct address (Renton, WA) below.\n\nSo, how do I correct my personal profile address before I submit my iOS Developer Registration?\n\nAdditionally, I realize I can Contact Apple to change my address after I am registered, but I would imagine things would be much faster and more streamlined if I correct the address before I finish my registration.\n\nA: I fixed it. Don't know why, but I know how.\nDuring the enrollment process, I had logged into My Apple ID to fix my address (only to find out that it was already correct there). Then, I opened up iTunes then went to the menu item Store > View Account. Once again, my address was correct there too, so I exited out of there.\nFrom there, I decided to cancel the Developer Program enrollment, to which the Apple site replied that it had saved my enrollment-in-progress. I started the enrollment over again (though it had much of my previous information retained).\nAt that point, it had corrected the address by itself.\nIn short: log in to My Apple ID, then View Account on iTunes, cancel enrollment then restart enrollment. Fixed (for me, at least).\n", "Q: Is there a way to play YouTube videos in the background? I remember that once upon a time I was able to start a song on the YouTube app (or Jasmine), then go and do other things on the phone.\nThat doesn't seem possible anymore with iOS 10.  Am I missing something simple?\n\nA: Yes! You only need to enter from safari and not from the app. You choose the song you want to listen to, press the home button, swipe up to multitask and press play!\n\nA: At the moment I don't think we can its because YouTube isn't a pre-installed app like it used to be, however there may be a app that can allow you to but I doubt it. Sorry\n\nA: Yeah you can all you've to do is play the youtube video in Safari and >> hit home button >> double tap the home button >> and from the fast access/ quick launch you can press the play button...\nfor more further details i've found this link you can check here though happy youtubing !!!\nDetails on how to play youtube videos in background on iOS Apple iDevices\n", "Q: Can I separate app download stats to see one app vs. another?

I have a macbook pro 2.5Ghz i5 retina 13 inches. I'm running Mountain Lion. When I change the resolution to 1280x800 (no HiDPI) it looks blurry, more blurry than a non-retina 13 inch macbook pro. Why is this? I don't understand this since its 1/2 of the native resolution.\nThanks\n\nA: Every monitor does better in its native resolution (yours is 2560x1600).\nThat's because the monitor always \"adjusts\" (scales the pixels) from the resolution you set to its \"native\".\nFor the best clarity you must set the resolution of your system to 2560x1600.\n", "Q: How many amps should an iPhone 5s car charger output? When looking on Amazon for a car charger I noticed that different items have different amp values, 2.1 and 3.1 being the most frequent. What is the recommended value?\nDoes it even matter? Is there more to it than the fact that more amps mean faster charging?\n\nA: I disagree with parts of Nathaniel's answer. The normal iphone charger is 5W and just over an amp. Using an iPad charger, either the 10W or newer 12W will absolutely charge your iphone faster. In fact, almost twice as fast. However there's some speculation that it may shorten the battery's lifespan. I've had no problems using an iPad charger on my 5S and it's charged in no time. So, you take a chance I guess but yes, the 2.1 amp ipad charger will cut charging time down considerably. \n\nA: More amps will not mean faster charging. The iPhone (and any electronic device) will only take as much current as it requires, and no more. The iPhone will take 1A to charge, and an iPad will take 2.1A.\nThere's no harm in using a charger that is capable of providing more current than a device requires, but there's no benefit either.\nProviding less current than the device requires will lead to longer charging times, or no charging at all.\n\nA: I'm using a 2.1 Amp charger for my iPhone 5 and it's charging extremely fast from 0 to 30 in just 15 minutes !\n\nA: Car chargers typically mis-represent the amperage they supply.  I have several, most of which indicate 2.1A, and they re-charge my iPad 4 and iPhone 6 at different rates.  Price is no guarantee, but in my experience, the correlation holds: the brand-name Griffin PowerJolt is my most expensive, and fastest car charger.\nhttps://store.griffintechnology.com/ipad/powerblock-powerjolt-wall-and-car-chargers-with-lightning-connector\n\nA: The I-pad chargers supply current at 12V and not 5V thus it will not charge the phone faster but will damage the charging port.*\n*This is completely wrong. Current is measured in amps (I) not volts (V). Where wattage is W: W = IxV. \nI do not know if higher wattages will damage your phone, but I do know when I accidentally hook-up my iPhone to my iPad charger, it heats up considerably.... I'd be very concert that if left for an extended period this would overheat and permanently damage my phone!\n", "Q: What can I do to keep AirPlay from buffering while playing movie from iPad 2? I downloaded a one hour HD TV show to my iPad 2 from the iTunes store and then set up the iPad 2 for AirPlay over the Apple TV. Many times it froze while buffering. What is causing this and how can I avoid this problem?\n\nA: The iPad 2 is one of the slowest CPU/GPU that can run iOS 7 and your HD content might be causing the iPad itself to not be able to encode the mirror video. The 7.1 update seems to be better optimized for my older iPhones, so you might retest after updating to the latest OS as well.\nYou could free up some load by being sure Airplay isn't in mirror mode and is just sending the stream to the AirPlay receiver instead of the screen and the receiver simultaneously.\nAdditionally, you can try playing SD content (or recording content from the camera and then playing that) to see if it's related to the length of the clip or the encoding. It still could be network congestion, but you might be correct in your diagnosis of the network as performing well enough to stream HD (especially if the Apple TV can stream HD itself and also uses WiFi.)\n\nA: How many users in the home using the computer? If there are a lot of people, that could be the cause. You can also do a speed test of your Internet connection at http://speedtest.net. If you see that your speed is slow and no other users at home have a heavy usage, you should call your provider.\n", "Q: iPhone playing songs not in any of my playlists I share an iTunes account with 4 others in my family and we have different music taste.

If you set the IP of the printer directly, then the Scan option will not be seen in the pref pane for the printer.  The Bonjour method is not good for us, because the computers are eventually connected to various subnets, and MDNS is blocked between the subnets.\nSo, if there is a way to add the scanner via its IP, it will allow us to setup the device once for all computers, and not care about which subnet it might eventually end up connected to...\n\nA: While I haven't found an answer to the exact problem, I do have a workaround (I think).\nIf you add the multi-function printer via the System Preferences, you can use CUPS to change the settings of that printer.\nTurn on the web interface:\ncupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\nGo to localhost:631/ in your favorite web browser, select \"Printers\" at the top, and select the recently-added printer in the list.\nThere will be two pull-down selectors, defaulting to Maintenance and Administration.  On the administration one, change it to Modify Printer.  You'll need to enter the computer administrator username/password at this point.\nThe first screen will show the current connection as what it was set to by bonjour (dnssd://.....) , along with a list of other options.  Near the bottom, in the \"Other Network Printers\" section, select LPD/PLPR Host or Printer and press Continue.\nUpdate the Description and Location if necessary, on the next screen.  You can also update the driver; however, the default driver is probably adequate.\nNow, instead of polling the bonjour/mdns name for the printer, it connects directly to the IP.  Printers can be accessed from any spot on the network; but, scanning functions only work from the same subnet.\nThis doesn't help set up a mass-deployment; but, it would allow you to make a net-install image, and push that entire image to the other computers.  That is what we'll end up doing here for the time being; until I can figure out what settings are being saved that indicate a particular printer has scan capabilities.\n", "Q: How can I completely disable desktop background change?

Additionally, it does not show up as a mounted device on Finder windows.\n\nA: A DMG can be set to display a license agreement before it will allow you to open it. This is normal and nothing to be alarmed about. Once you accept the license agreement, it will mount and open the normal Finder window showing its contents.\nSee this thread on Cocoa Builder.\nThere is no way to disable it and nothing is being auto-run.\n", "Q: If I add an SSD to a non-retina MBP 13\" will weight drop to 3.5 lbs I'm shopping for a new computer for university, and I'm considering the MBP 13\". I don't do graphic intensive work, so I do not need the retina display. It's not worth the extra cash. However, because I'm constantly carrying around my computer and turning it on and off, I want an ultrabook: something light and fast to boot. I'm thinking of buying the 13\" non-retina MBP, but selecting the 256 mb SSD option instead of the HD option. If I do that, of course, apple will drop the HD and optical drive from the machine. Will that get the weight down to 3.57 lbs? If so, it might be a cost effective way for me to get the machine I'm looking for. \nThanks.\n\nA: If you upgrade the 13\" non-retina MBP to a 256 GB SSD, that only saves you $100 vs. a retina MBP with the same 256 GB SSD ($1599 vs. $1699).\nFurthermore, the non-retina MBP will still have the optical drive no matter what (you can't configure it without one). So the only difference in weight will be the difference between the SSD and traditional HDD, whatever that is (I suspect not much, since Apple's own tech specs only say \"actual weight varies by configuration\").\nThe 13\" MacBook Air is a much better fit for what you're looking for: lower price ($1299), much lower weight (2.96 lbs).\n", "Q: Server options for late 2006 macbook I have an old late 2006 black MacBook. It has 2GB memory, and a 2GHz core 2 duo processor. I'm interested in using it on our home wifi network as a location for time machine backups (onto hard drives attached via USB) and a shared iTunes library (which an apple TV can access). The OS is currently Snow Leopard.\nShould I install a server version of OS X (I think I need this if it's to be recognised as a time machine destination)? For a Mac running Mountain Lion, this only costs £13.99 from the App Store (in the UK). The MacBook cannot be upgraded beyond Lion. What are my options?\n\nA: You are correct Mountain Lion will probably not run on it.  Also you need server software for it to be recognized as a time machine location.   Not sure if that was available in previous versions though.  OSX server is powerful,  but for simple use it is probably an overkill.  I have spent to many hours tinkering with mine while just using it for the uses that you state.\nIf you can get hold of an older version of OSX server and you are willing to tinker.. you could do all of that though \n\nA: Your MacBook 2006 cannot be upgraded to OS X Mountain Lion (see OS X Mountain Lion: Supported Macs.\nInstead of getting Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server (which may or may not be easily and cheaply available), you could just share the Time Machine folder on the external drive over the network through System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing. Then configure your other Macs to backup to this location. Keep in mind that this may not be very reliable and worse, it would be quite slow if you use the Wireless G WiFi on your MacBook.\nNote: You may need to run the following command in Terminal.app if you're unable to see the shared folder (the destination for the backup):\n\ndefaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1\n\nAlso read: \"How do I set up Time Machine to a shared drive on another Mac?,\" which provides detailed instructions on how to set this up.\n\nFor iTunes, you can just turn on Home Sharing and have all your other devices (Macs or iOS devices) stream from it. You would have to use the same Apple ID across all the devices for Home Sharing. The Wireless G speed is good enough to stream music.\n", "Q: How can I get iTunes 11.1 to list songs by album and show cover art Before being forced to upgrade iTunes I originally had my music library set up so that I had all the songs listed, ordered and group by album and I could see their cover art, this made things easier as some of the albums I have are OST with multiple artists so I can easily find all the songs of an album and make it int a compilation, I was also at the time adding cover art to every album since most music off CDs are devoid of this\nHowever after upgrading I can't do this, the songs section doesn't show the cover art and nothing is grouped like it was, the albums section has the cover art however everything is ordered by artist which is crap cause now I'm getting Mugen Souls, Darker than Black, Spice and Wolf and Puela Magi Madoka Magica all appearing before Accel World, also I don't see a track list unless I click on an album, also it appears I can't sort it\nI was in the process of reorganizing my entire library and I can't revert back to a previous version of iTunes as I have to have version 11.1 because iOS 7 refuses to even allow the device to connect (thus why I had to upgrade, I would have if given the choice), so, how can I get iTunes 11.1 to shows a list of songs, sorted and grouped by album and showing the cover art\nNOTE: I can't connect to the Internet\n\nA: figured it out, it could be that i did this in the old itunes and because it was years ago i forgot and that updating itunes reset every setting\nanyway, here are the steps i followed\n\n\n*\n\n*click on the icon in the top left hand corner and select show menu bar (or Ctrl + B)\n\n*click on View > Show View Options (or Ctrl + J (you may be able to skip step 1 but i didn't use shortcuts))\n\n*Make sure Sort By is set to Album\n\n*Click in the checkbox beside Show Artwork\n\n*make sure that under the Music Section that the checkbox beside Album is checked, if it is not the albums will not be sorted alphabetically like they really should, while you can sort by what ever way want sorting by name will split albums and you'll only see the groups if 2 or more in the list have belong to the same album (ie. Check Mate and Cheese from Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion R2 - OST 2 will appear grouped and before Chemical Magical Cooking from Dream Eater Merry Character Songs - Kounagi Yui but separated from Guren which belong to the same sountrack)\n\n\nOptional Parts (stuff i did because i like it)\n\n\n*\n\n*Check in the checkbox beside Always Show - unless the size of the list of songs in an album group is greater than or equal to the height of the artwork it wont show, i would say 7 songs cause alot of Opening Soundtracks i have have only 4 tracks, with Always Show checked the list of songs in an album has 3 spots left\n\n*Set the Artwork Size slider to max (may have an affect to what i have explained above)\n\n\nEDIT: these steps also work up to 12.0.1.26.

When you do step 2 make sure the view is set the view to Songs otherwise the options from Step 3 onward will not appear\n", "Q: What methods exist for reading out content to hear correct pronunciation? I would like to be able to have selected content from ebooks and webpages read out to me so that I may hear the correct pronunciation of words and sentences.\nWhat accessibility options exist to help me do this using existing apps like Safari and Kindle or iBooks, and do 3rd party apps exist that are specifically written to narrate selected text or contents?\n\nA: Several built in tools exist to assist with this sort of thing, but many of them are intended to help people with limited vision etc, whereas I understand that you want to hear particular words etc possibly as a learning tool.  You can still configure certain settings to help you do this.\nIn Settings > General > Accessibility you can use Voiceover to read out all screen interaction, allowing you to also perform a quick 3 finger down swipe across text to have it narrated to you.  There are various options for altering the lnaguages and dialects, the voice pitch and quality etc, but it does all tend to compromise using your device for anything else unless you are of limited vision etc.\nIn the same area, there is also Speak Selection; this is far more subtle, allowing you to select any text via the usual cut/copy/paste techniques, to which the option to Speak the selection is added, and you can configure various options as per the screenshot below.\n\nThis latter method is ideal for speaking snippets of text because it is a system tool, and will allow for the technique to work in any app in which you can select text.  The downside is that it is intended to be an accessibility tool for visually impaired people, and the pronunciation of the text is still very much \"computer speak\", resulting in some words being pronounced oddly or even incorrectly as all the narration is being synthesized  rather than using a base of real natural language to form words.\n\nIn the same text menu, you also have the Define, allowing you to pull up a dictionary definition of the word.  I've never been able to make any sense of the pronunciation hints in dictionaries that appear next to names, but if you can, then here it is to see (You can also change dictionaries if appropriate, you should be prompted to download one if you don't already have one)\n\nAs for 3rd party apps, I don't know of any that are available which have the specific purpose of reading aloud content with a primary purpose of pronunciation, this sort of tihng often requires large and complex databases containing snippets of genuine voice recordings which can be cut together to read aloud text with a far more natural sound that many of the simpler synthesized techniques as per above.\n", "Q: Problem loading images on Cultofmac.com in Safari and Chrome I have had a problem with the cultofmac site for a little while now.\nThe pages will load the text, video and some ads.

I have been told that the Go To Folder option in OS X contain many crucial system files.\nWhat exactly is the Go To Folder command within Finder and would it be therefore advantageous to disable it, to prevent access from other people (or indeed one's self).\nAdditionally if it was disabled, could it easily be re-enabled for technical support etc (with all crucial system files left untouched).\n\nA: In the Go menu of Finder, there is an option titled Go to Folder… with the keyboard shortcut ⇧ shift+⌘ cmd+G. This will prompt the user to enter a folder path and it allows Unix conventions (like using ~ to refer to one's home directory; for example ~/Documents refers to the Documents folder under your home folder). You can also type part of the file or folder name and hit Tab for autocompletion of the name.\nNote that you can go to any folder using this option (including your own folders for documents, music, downloads, movies and so on), not just system files or folders.\nAlthough OS X, starting with OS X Lion 10.7, started hiding important folders like ~/Library (the Library folder under one's home directory), the file/folder permissions system in OS X ensures that unless a user has an administrator account name and password, they cannot damage anything beyond what's within their own home folder (and the contents within it).\nEven if you disable this command, a user can still view system folders like /System, /Library, etc. (although the user won't be able to modify or delete anything there without administrator access/credentials). The user can also open up Terminal.app and navigate through directories that Finder does not show and cause damage to ~/Library.\n\nIf you still wish to disable it and remove this option in Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.app (from /Applications/Utilities)\n\n*Type the command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitGoToFolder -bool true && killall -HUP Finder\nTo enable it again, use the command (replacing true with false from the previous command):\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ProhibitGoToFolder -bool false && killall -HUP Finder\n\nIn conclusion, I'd suggest not to worry too much about it.\nInstead, the following may help better:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep the administrative account separate from normal user accounts\n\n*Ensure that user accounts are only shared with trusted people (or preferably, have one user account for each real user)\n\n*Share the administrator credentials only with trusted users\n\n\nRemoving the option is more like Security through obscurity, and is not really a fool proof way to protect the system.\n", "Q: Removing non App Store apps I use several apps installed using .dmg files downloaded from other sources rather than direct from the App Store.\nWhen I try to remove them through Launchpad, these apps will not show the X button to allow me to delete them.\n\nOn the right: Mac App Store app; On the left: app from external source.\nIs there any canonical safety way to remove them?\nIf I put them in Trash, will they disappear from my Mac without any related directories? How can I completely remove an app?\n\nA: To remove just the app you can drag it to the trash, use ⌘ cmd+⌫ backspace, or right-click → Move to Trash the app.\nTo remove the app, its preference files, and other related files, you will need another app along the lines of the free AppCleaner application.\nHere is a Lifehacker article titled \"The Best App Uninstaller for Mac\", which chose AppCleaner as the best uninstaller for the Mac (in 2011).\n\nA: \nThere isn't an app out there which really deletes all of the files\n  related to a certain app. To be completely sure, you have to do it by\n  hand.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up the Terminal \n\n*Type in sudo find / -iname \"*YOURAPPNAME*\" -print > ~/Desktop/uninstall.txt\n\n*Open the uninstall.txt file at your Desktop and look at the content\n\n*Now go through, line by line, and when you are sure a path is related to your app, type this on the command line (the path is just an example here):\n\n*sudo rm -r \"~/Library/Application\\ Support/APPNAME\"\nMany apps don't look deep enough, or in favor of security, don't delete all files they find.\n", "Q: Is there a clever way import my Mail.app rules to iCloud?

I selected erase my phone when WiFi is detected and then I selected remove the device.\nAfter thinking about this all night I am now wondering if I should not have deleted the device. Will the phone still erase the data even after I deleted the device from my account?\n\nA: As soon as the device connects to the internet, Apple's servers will send the erase message to the phone. I have seen this happen three weeks after the message was sent and the effect was nearly immediate.\nI don't know of any way to recall the erase message once you've sent it, and you should receive an email if the device ever registers and the erase message is sent.\nAll the things you did after the erase request are moot since if the phone never checks in, you can't really stop the erase and if it does ever check in, it will get erased and self remove from your list of devices.\nYou might open a support ticket with Apple to be sure the email will send if you erase the device (I haven't actually tested that sequence), but common sense says you might expect the email if the erase ever gets issued.\n\nA: First, I would say that your first step - checking for the phone on Find My iPhone - was excellent. Then, though, you should have called the police and reported it missing - while still frequently checking for its appearance in the software!\nIf you report the phone stolen, and you notify the police that you have tracking software enabled, they may help give it priority when it shows up on the software. (I had that happen with a missing iPad.)\nAs to whether the phone will still erase the data, I believe it will. Your instructions are sent to a server, which will follow through whenever the device appears online. You might try re-adding the phone to your account and see what happens...\nI would suggest giving it at least 3 days to appear before giving up, especially if the police are willing to help.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: how to download Rando photos from iPhone to Mac I've been playing around with the iOS app Rando, which anonymously exchanges photos with people around the world. Is there some way to download these photos to my Mac? To be clear -- the photos I take with Rando are normal iPhone pictures and easy to download; I'm asking about the photos from other people, which seem to live only in the Rando app.\n\nA: Any on screen image can be captured in a screenshot (press and hold home then press lock) which will be saved to your local camera roll.  If Rondo does not support exporting photos explicitly, you can just create a local copy using this method, the only downside being that the resolution will be capped to your devices screen size, not the original photo dimensions.\nAfter actually checking the app out, I noticed that if you double tap an image it gives you the option to save to the camera roll anyway, so you then transfer via the method of your choice: Photostream/iTunes Sync/Email/iMessage etc\n", "Q: iTunes storing iOS updates for later I'm currently downloading the iOS 7 update (7.01), but I'd like to wait a bit before installing it. After it finishes downloading, will it still stay in iTunes until I'm ready to install, or will it delete the file as soon as I shutdown? I used the 'Just Download' option, not 'Download and Install', so it shouldn't require me to install immediately after it downloads, but can I shut down so I can install later?\n\nA: It will happily sit and wait for you to install it at your leisure.  Apple even recently started background downloading this onto people's devices without them even requesting it, so that it is there when they want it.  Suffice to say that some people did not appreciate this, especially as it takes up a lot of space just sitting there, which is the only downside of just downloading.\n", "Q: Configure 1 of 2 keyboards for Dvorak I have 2 keyboards on my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8.5. I am trying to configure it so that typing on one keyboard will always use the Qwerty layout while typing on the other will always use the Dvorak layout. What would it take to configure or develop something that accomplished this? \n\nA: I type Dvorak myself. \nWhile I am interested in your idea, I do not believe that it is possible.\nMatias makes a keyboard that is dedicated to Dvorak in hardware, for US $100. In other words it types in Dvorak when the Mac's software keyboard layout is set to U. S. You could purchase one of those.\n\nFrom the company's description:\n\nHardwired Dvorak layout. The Matias Dvorak Keyboard gives you the\n  Dvorak layout, hardwired right into the keyboard. This approach has\n  advantages that software-based solutions can’t offer.\nSoftware Dvorak layouts may not take effect until after you log in, so\n  if you need to type a password, you’re stuck typing it in QWERTY. With\n  the Matias Dvorak Keyboard, you’ll never have this problem.\nSwitchable to QWERTY on the fly. A layout selection key lets you\n  instantly & easily switch the layout to standard QWERTY and back, for\n  those times when non-Dvorak typists want to use the computer.\nThe keyboard is labelled with both Dvorak and QWERTY key legends, so\n  you can easily see which key is which.\n\nI have not tried this model of keyboard, but I have used other Matias products.\nI type in Dvorak using a standard QWERTY keyboard, setting the Mac OS and Windows to use a software Dvorak keyboard layout. The whole point of using Dvorak is to learn to type faster, and that should also include training yourself to type without looking at the keys on the keyboard. Therefore it makes no difference to me what is printed on the keycaps, as I never look at them. So any standard keyboard will work fine for me and I can do Dvorak mapping in software on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux for that matter. \nShould it be necessary to toggle between Dvorak and the standard US QWERTY layout, that can easily be done in Mac OS X by assigning a keyboard shortcut in the Language & Text pane in System Preferences.\n\n", "Q: Why can't I connect my Iphone 4 to our home Wifi?

Opening Console, I saw things like this:\n\nTerminal[728]: Unable to load nib file: MainMenu, exiting\n  com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[211]: (com.apple.Terminal.60048[728]) Exited with code: 1\nTextEdit[724]: Unable to load nib file: Edit, exiting\n  com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[211]: (com.apple.TextEdit.58816[724]) Exited with code: 1\n  librariand[255]: client process 724 does not have a valid com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers entitlement\n  error in handle_container_path_request: LibrarianErrorDomain/9/The client process does not have a valid com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers entitlement\n\nThis was not a user-based or permissions-based problem, as I tried logging in as an existing user, and created a new user and logged in as them as well, both of which experienced the same issue.\nSo thank you, Drive Genius, and next time I'll be a lot more careful. In the meantime, I needed to figure out how to get these applications running again. I saw suggestions out there to use things like Pacifist to extract the original application files, but that only seemed to apply if you have original media, which we don't get anymore. And I'd have downloaded the software from the App Store, but catch-22, I couldn't open the App Store...\n\nA: Luckily, I had another system at the exact same OS level (this is important), which was working fine. I copied the following apps from that machine to a basic folder on the broken machine:\nApp Store.app\nTerminal.app\nPreview.app\nTextEdit.app\n\nOf course OS X won't let you copy those apps directly into the Applications folder, so I did this, which recursively copies all of the contents (since the .app files aren't just files) and replaces the existing, non-functioning copies:\ncp -R ~/<folder>/<file>.app /Applications/\n\nYou may have to really ask for a sandwich:\nsudo cp -R ~/<folder>/<file>.app /Applications/\n\nAnd joy, my system works again (but I haven't deleted the copies yet, just in case). \nHope it helps someone else.\n", "Q: How to make iCloud 3.0 on Windows sync bookmarks with Safari Since updating to iCloud 3.0 on Windows 7, I've noticed that my Windows installation of Safari is no longer syncing my iPad bookmarks.\nLooking at the settings in iCloud, Safari is no longer included:\n\nAs with my previous, much older question - How to make iCloud on Windows sync bookmarks with Safari, not Internet Explorer - I don't want to mix up the bookmarks of my desktop browsers with those on my mobile devices.\nHas Apple really removed the ability to sync bookmarks with PC Safari, or am I missing some trick?\n\nA: I was wondering the same thing when I found this:\nhttp://9to5mac.com/2013/09/19/farewell-windows-safari-as-apple-excludes-from-icloud-bookmark-sync/\nI looks like this is no longer possible.\n", "Q: Can Anyone Identify This Icon I noticed this icon next to my clock a couple days ago: \n\n\nI thought it might be related to Microsoft SkyDrive, but that is a different icon.  \nAny ideas what program that came from?

Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this.\n\nAFAICT I need to go find some random obscure MIDI player and download it for Mac, which seems extremely strange given that a site as large as Wikipedia uses them freely and assumes they \"just work\" on Mac. What am I missing?\n\nA: QuickTime Player 7 also supports mid files.\nMany DAWs like Logic support importing and exporting mid files, but one free MIDI sequencer or editor is Aria Maestosa. Synthesia is an application or rhythm game for practicing playing mid files.\n\nA: In addition to Quicktime Version 7.6.4 (518.35), I am able to play midi files with the free RealPlayer for Mac OS X, Version 12.0.0 (1725), on my 21.5-inch, Late 2013, 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 iMac, running OS X 10.9.5 (13F34). This older version should also work on PowerPC Macs.\n\nA: It's worth pointing out that QuickTime Player 7 will not work on the forthcoming MacOS Catalina 10.15, because it's 32-bit. When that OS is released, there will not be a native way of playing MIDI files.\nThere is an app in the Mac App Store called  MIDIPlayer X which works well. It costs a tiny bit of money, so you'll need to weight up whether the functionality is worth it for you.\n", "Q: Can I boot Linux (any distro?) from USB on a MacBook Air that has no hard drive? I've a MacBook Air that has burned out three hard drives from OWC.  The original drive is gone somewhere, and it no longer makes sense to purchase a replacement.  The rest of the hardware is in good order.\nMy question is, is there a linux disto that I can boot off of a usb (or an sd)?  I'm not dual booting (there's no hard drive) and reFit isn't an option either.  \nMost of what I've read assumes that a local hard drive is available.  There isn't in this case.  \nStarting to answer my own question now.  I've got reFit booting from a USB, now I'm wondering what needs to be done for reFit to boot a linux distro from another USB.  (Or, should the single USB contain both? refit and the distro?)\n\nA: I think it may be possible. I only have 2x iMac's, and I don't really want to pull the HDD out of either of them to test. However, that being said, a Mac system uses EFI rather than BIOS so you would need a Linux distro that has support for EFI.\nI am a hardcore Debian user, so this would work with both Debian and Ubuntu.\nSome things to decide:\n\n*\n\n*Are you using 32-bit or 64-bit version of Linux?\n\n*Does your preferred version of Linux support booting from EFI?\n\n*Does the Linux distro you want have LiveCD or LiveDVD versions?\n\n\nOnce you have decided this, fill in the blanks with what you need:\n\n*\n\n*Format a USB to Fat32 with MBR record\n\n*Create /efi/boot directory on this drive\n\n*Download either the 32-bit EFI or 64-bit EFI file and put it in the /efi/boot directory\n\n*Download the LiveCD or LiveDVD version of the Linux OS you want to run\n\n*Move the ISO file to the /efi/boot directory and rename it to boot.iso\n\nReboot your Mac with the USB in and hold down Alt/Option key when booting and you should be presented with a USB drive to select to boot from.\n", "Q: Leopard or Lion with Photoshop 11.0?

In the path above Downloads is a link to ~/Downloads. \nEdit : ~/Library/Containers seems to be used for sandboxing (sandboxing on dev.apple.com).  But why do I have 2 differents POSIX path for the same AppleScript paths ? \n\nA: The sandbox container directories contain symlinks to files the application is allowed read and write access to. For example ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Downloads/ is a symlink to ~/Downloads/.\nYou'll get the sandboxed directory path when you open the file and QuickTime is already open and the \"normal\" path when you open the file and QuickTime is not already open yet. \n", "Q: Disable Repeated System Alerts in iOS 7 On iOS 7, there is a feature under Cellular in Settings called: Use Cellular Data For:.

Why? I recently updated my OS X 10.8.5 Mountain Lion from Xcode 4.6.3 to Xcode 5 using the App Store upgrade.  \nAs I mentioned here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19051461/does-embarcadero-rad-studio-firemonkey-work-with-xcode-5, every time I tried to start Xcode 5, it would crash before I clicked or did anything.

My girlfriend is getting that well-publicized nausea/dizziness/\"carsickness\" from iOS 7's motion effects, though I'm not sure if it's because of the wallpaper or the animations overall. What can she do to tone them down? Are there options built into the software?\n\nA: Yes, she can change the behavior.\nFrom Apple's page on \"iOS 7: How to reduce screen motion\":\n\nLearn how to reduce screen motion in iOS 7.\niOS 7 uses a parallax effect to create the perception of depth on your Home screen and elsewhere.

I need a script that will be able to fire up a second Terminal instance and pass a command directly to that one whilst it continues it's own executions.\nIt's to start up Python script that will host a server whilst the main instance of Terminal would continue to run it's series of executions over a period of 30 seconds (for example) then it would be able to kill the PID of the Python script and kill that secondary Terminal process and continue until it's finished.\nDoes anybody have an idea of how to do this? Coming from Windows, it would be very easy to get a BAT file to execute a second BAT file in it's own environment and then kill it at a later stage.\n\nA: You can use the do script AppleScript command to run a command in a new Terminal window:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Terminal\" to do script \"uptime\"'\n\nIt doesn't start a second process or instance for Terminal though. On OS X there is typically only one instance for each application, even though you can use open -n to open another instance.\n\nA: Building on the previous answer, you can use the do script to run a second Terminal window and then even issue multiple commands sequentially using -e\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Terminal\" to do script \"uptime\"' -e 'tell app \"Finder\" to delete file \"filename\" on Desktop'\n\nSo this way you can specify multiple actions in sequence too using only 1 line.\n", "Q: Auto delete previous / old events from iOS 7 Calendar?

I'm getting more interested in using Terminal as an alternative way to address solutions on my Mac. I have seen this question entitled \"Is there a better way to shutdown/restart OSX?\".\nI would therefore like to know:\nHow to shut down, restart and sleep my Mac using the Terminal command exclusively ?\n\nA: The command you are after is shutdown.\nThis  informs all users that the machine is going to be shutdown and tells all apps to close files etc.\nThe command takes a parameter -h, -r or -s to shut down, restart or sleep the Mac.\nThe command has to be run as root so you need to use sudo.\ne.g. to reboot the machine immediately\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\ne.g. to shutdown the machine in 60 minutes\nsudo shutdown -h +60\n\nFrom comments there are two things to be addressed\nHow shutdown works is by sending a sigterm to all processes which should then deal with that e.g. save open files etc. If they don't exit then they will get sent a SIGKILL which forces them to die with no chance to respond. The signals are not sent via the normal key message queue so Apps have to deal with this separately to the code that gets called from quit on the menu. A good app should call common code from both.\nThis other answer shows how to shutdown as if you hit the menu options. But note that apps can cancel this shutdown\n\nA: Shut down without showing a confirmation dialog:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to shut down'\n\nShut down after showing a confirmation dialog:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"loginwindow\" to «event aevtrsdn»'\n\nRestart without showing a confirmation dialog:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to restart'\n\nRestart after showing a confirmation dialog:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"loginwindow\" to «event aevtrrst»'\n\nLog out without showing a confirmation dialog:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to  «event aevtrlgo»'\n\nLog out after showing a confirmation dialog:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to log out'\n\nGo to sleep (pmset):\npmset sleepnow\n\nGo to sleep (AppleScript):\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to sleep'\n\nPut displays to sleep (10.9 and later):\npmset displaysleepnow\n\nThe four letter codes for the Apple events are listed in AERegistry.h.\nAll System Events commands above send Apple events to the loginwindow process. loginwindow is sent the same Apple events as above when you log out, restart, shut down, or put the the Mac to sleep normally. See Technical Q&A QA1134: Programmatically causing restart, shutdown and/or logout.\nAccording to man shutdown, shutdown -h now and shutdown -r now send processes a TERM signal followed by a KILL signal.\nAccording to the Daemons and Services Programming Guide, when you tell loginwindow to log out, processes that support sudden termination are sent a KILL signal, and processes that don't support sudden termination are terminated in different ways: Cocoa applications receive the applicationShouldTerminate: delegate method, foreground applications receive the kAEQuitApplication Apple event, background applications receive the kAEQuitApplication Apple event followed by a KILL signal, and daemons receive a TERM signal followed by a KILL signal after a few seconds.\n\nA: Shutdown immediately:\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nIf you do feel like putting a delay on the shutdown, you can use the following command syntax instead:\nsudo shutdown -h +30\n\n(-h parameter set time to shut down, where (+)30 minutes to stop the system)\n\nA: also useful, to logout from the terminal command line prompt, type 'exit':\n[host:~user]$ exit\n\n", "Q: Creating A Stack That Shows Recently Used Applications etc In The Dock?

So now I want to pipe this response to a test of some kind. This is where I get stuck.\nI think if I can pipe/assign this output to a specified variable, I would be able to run a test on it.

Sometimes when I'm running a killall command from Terminal, a co-worker would suggest or edit my scripts to show killall -HUP.\nWhat does the -HUP part do?\n\nA: The -HUP option is the signal that's sent to the processes by the killall command. It can be a little hard to tell, but the relevant entry in the killall manual is:\n-SIGNAL     Send a different signal instead of the default TERM.  The signal may be specified\n            either as a name (with or without a leading SIG), or numerically.\n\nThe difference between the default TERM signal that killall sends and the HUP signal depends largely on the program you're sending the signal to. At the program end, they receive a different interrupt signal value. So the program can catch the interrupts and decide, based on the value, if they should do one thing or the other.\nThe TERM signal (historically the \"terminate signal\") is usually sent to a program to request its termination (which is a politer version of forcing its termination with the KILL signal). The program is free to catch and ignore the TERM signal. It doesn't have to terminate if it doesn't want to and it can completely ignore this signal.\nThe HUP signal (historically the \"hangup signal\") is usually sent to a program to request that it restarts and re-reads all its configuration in the process. The actual behaviour of the program depends on the program-specific implementation. Not all programs catch HUP and they aren't required to by convention or dogma. For example, the Apache web server will catch a HUP signal and re-read all its configuration files but it won't restart any processes.\nIf you want to truly terminate the processes and not worry about whether they're going to catch and obey the signal uses the KILL signal. It cannot be caught or ignored and results in process termination.\nFor a good review of available POSIX signals see this Wikipedia article.\n\nA: The -HUP is the \"hang up\" signal that may trigger an app to cease, read it's config file, and then start again. It is not necessarily any better than using it without.\nkillall Finder\n\nand \nkillall -HUP Finder\n\nAre respectfully the same. In OS X Finder will relaunch, but it will re-read it's configuation file. This might not be really the case if the application that is running does not have the -HUP function built into it. As the previous poster mentioned Apache. It reads it's config files, but it cannot launch again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to buy an Apple product in the UK and return it in the US? Is it possible to buy an Apple product, like an iPad mini, in the UK and return it in the US? And vice versa?\n\nA: More reading on Apple discussions indicates that the warranties are not honored internationally for iPads and iPhones. If you buy somewhere and it breaks, you will likely have to send it back to the country of purchase.

This is one of those things that has always seemed odd to me. I'm not sure if it's just typographic advice, or a hold over from when anti-alisiaing wasn't the norm in type but is there a known reason that the \"size\" options (which can be overridden by manual entry) jump from 14 to 18:\n\nSometimes you need 15, 16, and 17?!\n\nA: It dates back to dot matrix printers, believe it or not. Today, fonts are defined by vector shapes and the device rendering them fills them in with as many pixels as it can manage. But in the old days, there were no vectors, just patterns of dots. The font-maker had to draw the dots for each size individually.\nThe Macintosh team came up with a clever way of rendering the typeface in different resolutions for screen and for dot matrix printer -- the printer could handle 144 dots per inch, so the team made the screen render at 72 dots per inch... and whenever your document had text at 9 points on the screen, the printer would use the 18 point definition, 10 point would use 20 point and so on.\nBut because each definition had to be created separately and stored separately on the limited-space disks of the day (this was before hard disks -- everything had to run from floppies!), only key size/pairs were chosen. For text fonts, you usually had 9, 10, and 12 (and therefore 18, 20, and 24) and for title or display fonts, you usually had 14 and 18 (plus 28 and 36 for the printer to use). Exceptionally, you could have pairs like 24/48 and 36/72.\nThus the typical font menu in a Macintosh application starts with 9 and goes to 14, omitting 11 and 13, then tends to jump to doubles of earlier sizes.\n\nA: You should be able to add in additional font sizes with these steps (For Mountain Lion):\n\n*\n\n*Open an app, such as TextEdit, and choose Font from one of the menus. In TextEdit, choose Format > Font > Show Fonts.\n\n*Open the Action pop-up menu (looks like a gear) in the lower-left corner of the Font panel and choose Edit Sizes.\n\n*To add a new size to the font size list, type the size in the New Size field and click Add (+).\n\n*To change the minimum and maximum values on the font size slider, type new values in the Max. and Min. fields.\n\n*To remove a size from the font size list, select it and click Delete (–).\n\n*Click Done.\n\n*If you want to see what a font looks like as you adjust settings, open the Action pop-up menu (looks like a gear) in the lower-left corner of the Font panel and choose Show Preview.\nSource\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH10877\n", "Q: Automatically sync select folders between two Macs over LAN I'm working on two Macs, an iMac and a MacBook, both under OS X 10.8.5.

I have used Dropbox and ownCloud, but I don't see why I need to transfer the files over the internet when I have a cable that connects both computers directly over my local network.\nWhat I want is a solution that automatically syncs selected folders between these two computers, similar to a Cloud service, but directly, without the Cloud.\nI have no idea how to run rsync and don't want to learn it, so the solutions shouldn't be more complicated than installing Dropbox. It would be nice if the solution was open source and free, but that is not a must.\n\nUpdate [2014-05-19]:\nI'm under OS 10.9 by now, and I use ChronoSync to sync my computers. I wrote an AppleScript that mounts one computer from the other, opens a ChronoSync file, and then unmounts the volume again when syncing is complete. I saved this AppleScript as an app and put it in my Dock. So now all I have to do is plug in the USB cable into my laptop, have both computers running, and click the app symbol in the Dock.\nThe only problem I have is with ChronoSync sometimes showing an error on .DS_Store files. I'm unable to exclude this file type or file name, although theoretically ChronoSync offers the option to do this. It's not a real problem, though, as I told ChronoSync not to stop syncing on errors, and as yet I haven't had any problems with those files.\nI may look into iBackup, soon.\n\nUpdate [2015-04-13]\nIt's been two years now and I still happily run my AppleScript.

It syncs over LAN by creating a \"secret code\" between the synced folders. You have the option to view your files on an iOS device through their free app. It's free and supports multiple platforms.\nThis is quoted from their website:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync and Share - Sync unlimited files between your own devices, or share a folder with friends and family to automatically sync anything.\n\n*Private and Secure - File transfers are encrypted. Your information is never stored on a server in the cloud and your data is protected by private keys.\n\n*Bigger is Better - BitTorrent Sync is specifically designed to handle large files, so feel free to sync original, high quality, uncompressed files.\nI have been using it for couple months now. It's pretty much set it up and forget it.\n\nA: I use iBackup for this. It is actually a GUI for rsync, so it is very efficient at syncing.\nIt's not quite as simple as DropBox, but it is quite straightforward.\nIt is free for personal use.  \n\nA: I have 3 iMacs, 3 Mac notebooks and two PCs. Keeping files in sync on each computer was so much trouble. So, I came up with my own idea. I bought Apple Time Capsule hard drive and connected to my LAN. Then I put all my files on this drive. \nNow I can access all files from all 6 different computers and I don't even have to use any hard drive space on any computers. Works beautifully, including watching stored movies on any of my computers from my Time Capsule. I even access files from PCs too.\nOnly drawback is that if you lose the file, you cannot get it back.

I want to be able to do this to setup backups over the wireless network.  When I connect the HDD directly to my MBP, it auto-mounts and I can utilize it without any problems.\n\nSolution:\nI ended up calling Apple support and they advised that the Airport should have sufficient power for the drive.  They had me switch to a normal USB 2.0 cable instead of the Y adapter.  Further, they had me reformat (again) to Mac OS Extended (case-insensitive).  Magically, this combination works.\n\nA: If the HDD is a 2.5' (laptop drive) that draws power from nothing else but the USB port it will never work with a USB Hub. They all share the same power source on the Airport that has a limit of 500mA. That would work with the hdd directly in the Airport but connecting an unpowered USB Hub draws around 80-100mA and the hdd is left with 400mA to start... which is too low.\nI can only imagine, but i think you are using this setup to connect more than one drive to the Airport and having multiple disks shared by it. That's ok but...\nFor this to work you need a special USB hub known as a Powered USB hub that you can connect to the wall socket separately. This separate power adapter draws 2-2.5A of power from the wall socket to power each USB Hub port with its own 500mA thus being able to give enough current to the hdd to operate correctly.\nCheck this out.

It also doesn't really dig into why the store became corrupt so you might have the same thing happen again at a later date. I've also had good luck with reproducible time machine problems reporting it to Apple for assistance. They'll want you to run tmdiagnose and probably not reset things like I mentioned above if you want to get at the root cause of what really happened as opposed to getting it working again.\n", "Q: How to i update an iPhone 4 with iOS 4.3.5 offline i was able to update my iPhone 4S and iPad via the option on the settings menu however i iPhone 4 which i use as my music player doesn't have that option, my computer with itunes doesn't connect to the internet so i can't download it via itunes\ni am wondering if there is an offline installer i can download that itune can detect to use, that way i can download it on a separate computer then transfer it to my main computer\n\nA: There exists direct download links for the restore images that you can download from one computer and use for the restore on your own computer, however you will still need an internet connection for the final part of the installation (iTunes needs to verify with Apple servers).\nOnce you have the .ipsw file on your computer, hold down ⌘ Command (or control if on a PC) while clicking 'Update' in iTunes, and select the .ipsw file for your iPhone.\n\nA: If you want to do an offline upgrade iOS to iOS 7.1, follow the steps in this guide\nhttp://echo.com.ng/2013/howto-apple-ios-7-offline-manual-upgrade\n", "Q: Disable Spotlight Index on 10.8 on Specific Volumes To switch off indexing in Terminal I use:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nThis disables it with the -a switch across all volumes and the -i off part turns \"off\" the indexing.\nIf connected to my iMac is the following volumes:\n/Volumes\n  /MacintoshHD\n  /BOOTCAMP\n  /NAS6TB\n\nHow do I specifically turn off the indexing service only for /BOOTCAMP and /NAS6TB?

You need to perform the shake fairly quickly after realizing the mistake, since if you switch apps or go to the home screen, the undo status goes away rapidly.\nAlso, you can always browse the trash|archive folder and re-move messages back, assuming you can locate that message by sight or depending on the current inbox sort (date range, etc…)\n", "Q: Image size above 1536px for iBookstore? I'm putting together a picture book in iBooks Author.\nThe images for each page are around 3500px by 3500px.\nI'm uploading them as square images, and just leaving a margin on each side of the images.\nAs I understand, the maximum image size on the short side of an ipad is 1536px.\nI can reduce my image sizes to 1536px.\nBut I'd prefer to keep them bigger so any future ipads with finer resolution, are accounted for. I'd drag the images to the pages in the iBooks Author document and then use the handle-drag things to fit them to the screen size.\nBut if for users it will increase the download time / make my book run slower, then I'll reduce the images to 1536px.\nOr if there's another reason to reduce them, then I will.\nIs there reason to make the images 1536px and not bigger?\n\nA: The main disadvantage is the current iPad will not be able to show the whole image with the high resolution as it was intended to be seen. Unless you were able to make the images a kind of \"downloadable content\" to view on a computer monitor.  \nIt would increase the download time of the iBook, but that also depends on how many images are in the book and what the overall finished and compiled file size is going to be.  \nI personally have downloaded books that were 1GB directly to my iPad via wifi, but that is because I have fibre optic connection.

I did that, and a blinking question mark appeared on the screen. My MBP could not find any bootable partition.\nAny idea what can I do to get Ubuntu up and running?\nBy the way, I want to point out there is no OS X partition left on my drive - I didn't use any kind of program for dual boot, since I wanted to install OS X on another physical drive.\n\nA: You can't simply install Ubuntu on your internal drive, because Apple's EFI and GRUB (the bootloader) don't get along.\nYou will also need an EFI bootloader, like rEFInd (a fork of rEFIt):\n\nrEFIt is a boot menu and maintenance toolkit for EFI-based machines like the Intel Macs. You can use it to boot multiple operating systems easily, including triple-boot setups with Boot Camp. It also provides an easy way to enter and explore the EFI pre-boot environment. Source: The rEFIt Project\n\n\n\nA: You can simply install Ubuntu on a local drive, but you must reformat the drive as an MBR partition, which Apple's EFI can read in some kind of legacy mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*But, as far as I can tell, you can only format a drive as MBR when it's attached to a different system.\n\n*You may occasionally hit startup hangs/delays of a few minutes. I'm not sure what's happening, I think the lack of bless might mean the firmware is having trouble figuring out how to boot the drive.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, if you want to stick with a GPT partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-install OS X. If your firmware is reasonably recent, you can hold Command+R at startup to download and install a copy of OS X from Apple's servers. This should take 30-60 minutes.\n\n*Once OS X is installed again, install rEFInd as your EFI bootloader. (Download it, run ./install.sh --alldrivers.)\n\n*Now you can install Ubuntu, and wipe your OS X partition. Keep your first partition intact, as it contains the EFI bootloader. (There's no need to install GRUB, as rEFInd --alldrivers includes a driver that can load a kernel directly.)\n\n", "Q: iMessage won't activate! I have had my iOS 7 update for about a week now. Today I noticed I couldn't send or recieve messages. It says \"Waiting for Activation\" and iMessage won't turn on! It also won't let me press my phone number under send and receive!\nWhy won't it activate and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Oh boy I have seen this case so much... In my case, I live in Peru, and most carriers and cellular plans here have a limitation to send SMS just locally, not worldwide. iMessage activation requires that the phone sends an SMS to servers on UK (I don't know why), so the limitation blocks it and the phone stays forever on the \"Waiting activation\" screen.\nThe solution (for this situations, at least) is to buy some prepaid charge for the phone number. The prepaid ammount have no restrictions and can be used to call or send SMS worldwide, so it just takes another try disabling and enabling the iMessage service and this time it will work. It does take a couple of minutes on activating it, though.\nPlease keep in mind that this might be a country/carrier-specific-solution, but overall, you get the idea.\n\nA: Reset network settings on your device and rejoin your network. \n\nA: I have an iPhone 6. Couldn't get iMessage to work or FaceTime after I'd  backed up my iPhone 4s to iTunes then attempted to restore onto my new iPhone 6. Tried everything mentioned but no luck. \nIt turned out to be as simple as a hard reset I think it's called.

However, when I upgraded to iOS7, when I hold a link, the menu no longer comes up.  Nothing happens.  I haven't been able to find any setting which would change this.  Is there something new with iOS7 which I didn't know about before upgrading?\n\nA: I downloaded the app to test what you were taking about, and I can confirm the issue. They last updated the app on November 20, 2012, so this is most likely a bug that will need to be fixed by them. You can try to contact them at atomicbrowser@gmail.com about the issue.\n\nA: I have the same issue in iOS 7 on both iPod 5 and iPhone 5s. I contacted the developer once or twice; I even tried posting a comment in their blog.\nUltimately I installed Mercury instead. I was able to export my Atomic bookmarks to Mercury and I moved most of my saved files and web pages into other applications. I keep Atomic around just in case it gets updated, because I still like how it does some details.\n", "Q: How to downgrade EFI firmware back to version 1.6 I'm trying to get a SATA III hard drive to work in my MacbookPro5,1. I think I've finally figured out that if I downgrade the EFI firmware to version 1.6, my computer will negotiate the link at SATA 1 speeds and the drive will work correctly. However, the instructions all point to a file that doesn't exist anymore. See this answer for the instructions where the file doesn't exist anymore.\nDoes anybody have a copy of the file aluminum.macbook.pro.recovery.dmg?\n\nA: I finally managed to successfully downgrade the EFI firmware to version 1.6. Unfortunately that didn't make my hard drive work. However I'm going to reproduce my steps here so that the whole world can know what it takes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the EFI firmware update package from Apple. Here is the link I used for firmware version 1.6 for my late-2008 MacbookPro5,1: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL746\n\n\n*\n\n*WARNING! If you use the wrong firmware for you computer, bad things will almost certainly happen. This isn't my experience but it would probably brick your computer, meaning it will change from being a computer that can compute things to being a brick that just sits there. You have been warned!\n\n\n*The EFI firmware update 1.6 comes as a .pkg file. Since it won't extract for you unless your computer needs the update, you will have to extract it yourself. The best way I found to do this is with the app unpkg. When you extract the contents using unpkg you will end up with a folder \"MacBookProFirmwareUpdate/Applications\". Move the app \"MacBookProFirmwareUpdate/Applications/Utilities/MacBook Pro EFI Update.app\" to \"/Applications/Utilities/\" (where your calculator app etc. are located).\n\n*Now comes the magical part: open a terminal window and run the following command (all one line):\n\n/usr/sbin/bless -mount / -firmware \"/Applications/Utilities/MacBook\n  Pro EFI Firmware\n  Update.app/Contents/Resources/MBP51_0074_01B_LOCKED.scap\" --recovery\n  --verbose\n\n\n\n*\n\n*WARNING: This bypasses ALL of the safety checks built into the app. You are responsible for making sure your computer is connected to a reliable power source and that the update will not be interrupted. You are responsible for making sure this firmware will work on your computer. I am not responsible for you turning your computer into something else not a computer anymore.\n\n*Note: This command is for version 1.6. For another version you would need to change the file name to whatever it is in the package you downloaded from Apple.\n\n*The --verbose option should let you know about any errors.\n\n*This would only work for me on an internal hard drive, because an external drive \"wasn't acceptable for a recovery drive\" or whatever. Removing the --recovery option makes the next step not happen.\n\n\n*Restart your computer. I heard an angry beep and then there was a gray Apple screen with a progress bar. That's a good thing. If you don't get that then something went wrong.\n\n*Your EFI firmware should be flashed! Launch \"System Information.app\" to check that \"Boot ROM Installed\" sort of matches the name of the .scap file used above. For version 1.6 this is \"MBP51.0074.B01\".\nIn order to get to this point I had to disassemble the firmware update app downloaded in step 1 to get the command in step 3. I think it was the --recovery part that made it finally work, but I also did a couple of other things with unknown effect:\n\n\n*\n\n*During step 2 there is also a file \"MacBookProFirmwareUpdate/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.updater.macbookpro.efi.plist\" which I extracted to the corresponding locstion.\n\n*After step 3 I also ran the following AppleScript:\n\n\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n\nmake new login item at end of login items with properties {path:\"/Applications/Utilities/MacBook Pro EFI Firmware Update.app/Contents/Resources/MBP51_0074_01B_LOCKED.scap\"}\n\nend tell\n\n", "Q: How to Partition New Bootable Drive to Include Recovery Partition I just completed a restore from Time Machine to a newly partitioned drive and discovered that the Recovery Partition wasn't created. Other than that, the restore went well and the new drive runs fine.\nI discovered that my SATA drivers don't support this new drive. It only works as an external drive. So I am going to restore to another drive, basically repeating the process. While I have a recovery partition on my original drive, I want to know how to create a restored drive that includes the recovery partition.\nOther similar questions on SE don't seem to address this question, except indirectly. This one -Add recovery partition back onto drive after drive change [duplicate] - points to another, where one answer says: \n\nyou can make a new Recovery Partition by performing a clean install\n  but if you do this via a new partition, beware that erasing that new\n  partition in the future may also erase the Recovery Partition.\n\nI was going to try doing a clean install to create the Recovery Partition and the main partition, but I'm not sure about this, based on that comment.\nI have the following that I can start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine backup (for restoring)\n\n*OS X install dmg file (Lion in my case)\n\n*a working Recovery Partition on a USB stick\n\n*My original bootable hard drive with an old image with OS X 10.7.4 and a Recovery Partition (working)\n\n*My latest restored hard drive (working, but only as a USB drive) with OS X 10.7.5 and no Recovery Partition \n\n*My target hard drive, which is essentially blank (was my previous working drive, until I upgraded)\n\n\nSo what is the most straightforward way to restore to a virgin drive from Time Machine AND \ninclude a recover partition?\n\nA: According to a post by SuperDuper's developer, reinstalling OS X over an existing installation adds a missing recovery partition:\n\nActually, you can easily recreate the recover partition by simply reinstalling Lion from the App Store. (This has the additional benefit of updating the recover partition with the most recent data, too.)\n\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/27102 says the same thing:\n\nI installed a larger drive in my MBP and cloned my original disk to the new drive using SuperDuper! This process doesn't create the restore partition. Reinstalling Lion onto the new drive created the necessary partition for me.\nI reinstalled this using the \"USB Key\" installer run from a partition on an external drive. My User accounts, applications, etc. survived the reinstall but I did have to run the updaters for the OS and reinstall Java after the Lion reinstall.\n\nReinstalling OS X from the App Store (or using an installer app you have already downloaded) is probably easier than using an external drive though.\nAbove, \"reinstalling OS X\" means doing an upgrade install over the current installation. See Apple's KB article OS X Mountain Lion: Reinstall OS X.\nSimply upgrading to 10.8 or 10.9 would probably also add a recovery partition.\n", "Q: Prevent mounted volumes/folders from clogging the desktop on log in I have a lot of volumes (folders) mounted from remote machines, about 10 of them, which I set to be mounted automatically when I'm logging in by adding them to the Login Items list in Users & Groups.

I have to type up papers with medical abbreviations. 4 common abbreviations are ā, p, c, s (also with a line over them like the ā). Right now I have to use a text box with the line in it and place that over the letters p, c, and s, set the txt box to be in the background but selectable.  Then every time I edit the document the line moves separately from the letter and you can imagine what a pain it is.  I'd like to create these characters, add them to special characters and then insert from there.  \nDoes anyone know of a way to do this via special characters or know of another way to accomplish the same thing?\n\nA: You can add a line over p, c, s either with the US Extended keyboard layout (base letter then option/alt + a) or the Character Viewer (double click on unicode 0304 after the base letter).  Best just copy them from here:\np̄\nc̄\ns̄\nYou may need to try different fonts to get them to display properly\n\nA: You would either need to create a font and add these characters to it, or find a font that contains these characters already (which I would imagine is possible if they are used commonly in a field).\nIn terms of accessing the characters, since they will probably be way off in the extended character set and not easily typed, look at the System Preferences > Language & Text settings, on the Text tab, and create a substitution. You could set it so that typing the letter \"a\" followed by a hyphen and a space substitutes the character \"ā\", for example.\n\nA: Look at the answers to this question. Especially useful might be the approach in this answer to edit the values in /System/Library/Input Methods/PressAndHold.app/.

From this article,\n\nThe 5s and the 5c are compatible with more 4G LTE frequency bands — up to 13, instead of a maximum five before. That means the phone is more likely to work with higher speeds wherever you go. However, there are more than 40 cellular bands worldwide, the bulk for LTE, so a version bought in one country might not work for high speeds everywhere around the world.\n\nSay one were to buy an iPhone 5s in the United States and take it to Europe (specifically, Belgium). Would there be any performance impact, given the purported differences in cellular bands?\n\nA: There are actually 4 different international variations for the iPhone 5s/5c. Thankfully, Apple has a page outlining them with their model numbers, supported frequencies and countries/carriers you can use them with.\nA quick look over that breakdown seems to suggest that Belgium (at least, Mobistar) uses LTE bands 1, 3 or 5, which the US AT&T model also supports. However, I would recommend you contact your carrier to ensure what frequencies are needed to function best on your network.\n\nA: I'm not quite sure if assessing any performance impact based on region is actually technically possible without the complete analytical participation of the cellular service provider and any or all contractual third party suppliers.\nHoping that this might be at least some level of help though I have found an article detailing the chips in play which may be of interest to you and where their specifications might be food for further research; specifically: -\n\nThe chips that deliver the RF capabilities of a phone tend to be over\n  shadowed by more consumer-friendly specifications like the number of\n  GB of storage, or the clock speed of a processor.

When I plug in the charger it turns back on without a reboot but suddenly the battery icon shows 10 or 11 %..\nAny ideas on these issues? Could my charger be defective and charging the battery too much?\n\nA: The fact that your computer shuts down at 50% remaining charge and also that your MagSafe LED remains orange makes me think that either the replacement battery isn't an official Apple part, that it is defective/DOA, or that your logic boards SMC is corrupted and needs to be reset. \nIf the battery is indeed new and Apple original than proceed with an SMC reset:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964\nThis will tell the SMC chip to reset all power states and reboot so that it forgets the battery and MagSafe adapter momentarily and then rediscovers them.\nHope that helps\n", "Q: Where is the preference list for \"open with\" applications?

Is there any way to fix this problem?\n\nA: The clear error would be a city in another state or country.\nThe sunrise and sunset data for Minneapolis, KS is going to be different than Minneapolis, MN.\nOnce you have ruled that out, you might need to file a bug with Apple in the case that their app is either requesting the wrong data from the weather service provider or the data source needs to be corrected. In both cases, you can't really change what happens in code or upstream and could only try to find a location that's close enough for weather purposes that has correct (or close enough) sunrise and sunset data.\nhttp://apple.com/feedback might also be workable rather than filing a bug if enough people have issues where the current data set is lacking or off by hours.\n\nA: If foregoing does not solve it: in Settings->General-Date&Time disable \"set automatic time zone\".\n", "Q: RDP from OS X to Windows using RD/TS Gateway Services?

I know the iMac is limited to a single SATA III and a PCIe slot for storage, but I'm trying to balance performance with capacity with future expandability. I fear that my choice of the 256GB SSD is limiting me, since I won't be able to add a hard drive in the future. My questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Which is faster, the 128GB PCIe SSD that comes in a Fusion Drive\nconfiguration, or the 256GB SSD I purchased?\n\n*Is the PCIe connector compatible with the typical PCIe SSDs sold for PC use, or is it something proprietary like in the Retina\nMacBooks?\n\n*Is it worth sticking to the stock 1TB HDD and installing my own PCIe SSD to make a DIY  Fusion Drive (I.e. Are there compatible PCIe\nSSDs for less than $180)?\n\nA: *\n\n*The PCIe flash storage will be faster than the SSD, but how much you'll notice that in the real world is questionable.\n\n*The PCIe card used in the new iMacs is the same (custom) stick-like form factor Apple uses in their other products.\n\n*You should get the 1TB or 3TB Fusion drive configuration if you want more than 256GB of storage and don't want a larger SSD. You could of course get an external USB3 drive to provide large storage if you prefer, or even get a USB/Thunderbolt external SSD.\nThe $200 for the fusion drive is expensive, but not insanely so. It will give the most noticeable performance boost of any possible upgrade on the iMac, unless you prefer to spend the money doing an all-SSD setup, which will still be very, very fast.\nYou're not going to find a compatible PCIe SSD for any less than Apple's upgrade cost. For example, OWC sells compatible SSDs for the MacBook Airs (http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/Aura_Pro_Air_2012) that may work, but I don't believe anyone has specifically tested it.\nI will also note that opening up the current iMacs is more difficult than in the past, due to the laminating process on the screen to reduce glare, parallax and weight. It would be a false economy to buy a $2000+ computer, only to risk damaging it by opening it up for the chance to save $50. If external storage is not desirable and you want more capacity, go Fusion.\n\nA: For future viewers, here are my results (from my experience with an iMac of the specifications in the original question):\n@Nathaniel was right on point all his points:\n\n\n*\n\n*The PCIe SSD is faster than a SATA SSD, but VERY MUCH so. The 256GB SSD that Apple uses does about 350MB/s write, and 750MB/s read, it's a BEAST. ([reference])1\n\n*The all of the current SSD options use PCIe SSDs, leaving the 3.5\" SATA III drive bay available for future expansion.\n\n*Fusion drives really aren't that bad of an idea, but it's nice to know all my data is on the SSD side of life.\n\n", "Q: Started receiving copies of text messages sent on other phone after upgrading to iOS 7 I recently updated my iPhone to iOS 7. Now, any messages my wife sends on her iPhone (which is still on iOS 6) as well as any messages she receives are sent to me. She does not get copies of my messages, unless I specifically send them to her.\nHow can I prevent getting her messages?\n\nA: You need to look in Settings > Messages > Send & Receive > You can be received by iMessage at... and also Start new conversations from.\nIt looks as though your Apple ID has become set to receive messages on both (all) devices.  Ensure that only the phones unique phone numbers and non-shared email address for Apple ID/iCloud accounts are included on each device.\nFor future consideration, note that iCloud/Apple ID accounts are free, and that on each device you log into iCloud services (like mail, calendars, imessage etc) separately from the App Store, so if you share an account for the purpose of sharing downloads (and I see no other reason to do so) then you should consider using that account for App Store usage only, and each have an individual iCloud account for all other functions, that way you won't ever cross contaminate each others stuff.\n\nA: When you setup a new iOS device it unfortunately asks for and AppleID and then uses that same AppleID to set up the iTunes Store, Messages, and iCloud.  Although that may make some folks lives easier, it causes great confusion for many iOS users that use a shared AppleID for the Store, and individual AppleIDs for other services like iCloud and Messages.\nLuckily, as the answer above points out, you simply need to go to the iOS settings for Messages on each iOS device you use, and make sure that only your iPhone's phone number, and your personal (unshared with your Wife) AppleID email address is listed in the \"can be received by iMessage at\" setting.  If the AppleID you share with your wife is listed, select it and remove it from the list.\nPut simply, you and your wife need one shared AppleID for logging into the Apple Store (so you can share apps and music purchased), yet you both need you own personal AppleIDs to use with other services such as the setting for iCloud and iMessages.  Note also that in your iOS settings, each of those services have their own setting for which AppleID is associated with them.\nMy final advice is to actually get the three AppleIDs created first, then put all of your iOS devices and/or Macs on the same table and go through the iCloud settings, iMessages settings, and iTunes Store settings on all of the devices making sure that you only use your shared Apple ID for the iTunes Store.\nAlthough this can be confusing, once you understand this association between AppleIDs and the different services on iOS and Mac OSX, it can be quite flexible.  The only real difficulty comes when more that one person shares an iPad where you want to also receive iMessages (you just need to choose who's account will send/receive text in this case).\nI hope this makes these settings a bit more clear.\n", "Q: How to install WhatsApp on an iPad 4 without 3G?

The first hit was this \"Payload free package to create a user on a 10.7 system\" Python script:\nhttps://gist.github.com/rustymyers/1242589\nThat script seems to call dscl -create, followed by dscacheutil -flushcache, followed by writing some data to /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/%s.plist.\nI haven't looked at the script in much depth, but it might perhaps give you a starting point?\n", "Q: iOS7 new/updated apps, NOT showing blue dot.

Sometimes the number of apps shown needing an update is not in line with what the App Store says when you visit it.  Sometimes it says that all apps are up to date when you can easily find an update when you search manually on a title (for example Facebook and Twitter both showed as current even though I knew they have been updated to iOS7, hunting down the apps directly in the store and selecting Open kicked off an update instead).\nI think that the best I can say is that there are issues, but they are hard to track down, are not the same for everyone, and are not even consistently the same across a specific unique device.  It's worth asking the question though, perhaps someone with more knowledge may be able to track down some formal bug report or similar that indicates that this is a wider issue that has been reported or is being looked at.

Is is possible to enable encryption for a Time Machine target disk with a script or using the command line? \nIs an encrypted Time Machine disk really just the same as a normal disk, full-disk-encrypted using FileVault? \nI'd like to automate as much as is convenient when installing a Mac for a new user. This includes backups. We're using OS X Mountain Lion.\nAdditional discoveries:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can ask a target to be encrypted from the Time Machine preferences GUI. This does not make it show up as such using the fdesetup command. It will however list as encrypted using diskutil cs list\n\n*If first encrypting a drive, the Time Machine prefs GUI will say \"Encrypt backups\" for that entry. This would support the method suggested below by Rene (except he suggests doing it on an encrypted image placed on a disk).\n\n\nA: No, sorry chickpee, I believe you're incorrect.\n\nIs an encrypted Time Machine disk really just the same as a normal\n  disk, full-disk-encrypted using FileVault?\n\nYes. It is. This would be \"FileVault 2\" we are talking about, aka CoreStorage, Apple's newish logical volume manager. This is different that the previous TM and FileVault technologies, which are based on AES-encrypted sparse-bundle disk images (which are still used for network backups, etc.). The process that starts in System Preferences (these days) when you enable disk encryption (whether on an external disk, for Time Machine, or on the boot drive for FileVault), provided the disk is suitable, it does an online conversion from a traditional GPT Partition Table to a single monolithic data store, with a very small partition for the CS firmware. Logical volumes (in logical volume groups) are then carved out of this, and these (software) volumes are then HFS formatted and encrypted.\nI believe the most straightforward method for doing this would be to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach the disk you're going to use, wipe it. Free space or a single HFS+ partition.\n\n*diskutil cs create/convert (wasn't/was formatted; unimportant) to initialize and add a new LVG\n\n*diskutil cs createVolume, create a single LV. You could enable encryption at this point, with diskutil cs encryptVolume, if you know the passphrase you're going to use;\nif not, leave it unencrypted for now.\n\n*diskutil partitionDisk diskX -- see below -- CS volumes appear as if they are completely autonomous, separate disks, so you partitionDisk.\n\n\nThen: mount and unlock the volume on your new user's machine. Once the disk is unlocked, there shouldn't be any trouble 'adopting' it for use there. If you want to put it into a config script, I believe it's just something like tmutil -a /Volumes/Foo, tmutil startbackup -ad disk.... This is the part I'm least sure about, but I'm also sure its easily doable. I haven't done this for Time Machine per se my self, but I pre-encrypt disks for FileVault like this all the time, and the OS sort of just knows what to do with if after that.\nA properly suitable CS-enabled-disk is going to appear like this in diskutil (although you might not have the third partition on disk0 if it's knows it's not going to be a boot drive:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         250.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               250.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh LV           *249.8 GB   disk1\n\ndisk0 will not appear as encrypted, ever, since this is what the volume manager basically has to 'boot' off of. disk1 will be encrypted and will require the passcode to mount.\n\nA: I'll chance an answer.\nEncrypted Time Machine backup isn't the same as FileVault, it's actually the same as selecting \"Mac OS Extended ([Case-sensitive], Journaled, encrypted)\" in Disk Utility.  \nSo to automate it with an external drive, assuming it is \"disk1\", I think the following should work (sorry, don't have a spare USB drive around to test on):\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk1 1 GPT JHFS+ TimeMachine *X*G [X=size of partition]\nsudo tmutil setdestination /Volumes/TimeMachine\ndiskutil cs convert disk1s2 -passphrase *xxxx* [or -stdinpassphrase if you prefer]\n\n", "Q: Why does Back Up Now work from Time Machine Preferences but not from the status bar?

If it doesn't, I'd like to know how the device responds when you try to delete the app from the hardware.\n\nA: Maybe this helps:\nI had this problem recently with an iPhone 5s and the Dropbox app. I tapped on Dropbox to pause it, then I hooked the iPhone up to iTunes, interrupted the automatic sync, downloaded all available updates and triggered a manual sync. \nAnd Voilà! - the problem is gone.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Settings -- General -- Storage And Usage\n\n*Select the app that you want to delete\n\n*Clear its data and/or delete it permanently\n\n\nA: What I would do is this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the app store.\n\n*Tap updates\n\n*Tap cancel next to the offending app\n\n*Uninstall the app. I think you already did this.\n\n*Try reinstalling the app and see if that works.\n\n\nI've had this issue with some of the apps I update. They do update eventually.\n\nA: If all of the options above doesn't work, try the good old method of force restart Hold down BOTH the Power button and the Home button until the device restarts.\nRemember to back up your important data before trying the force restart.\nAlthough force restart only cleans up temporary files, better safe than sorry!\n", "Q: Broken dock connector on iPhone 4 My iPhone 4's dock connector is broken. I can still use it to transmit data to and from the phone, but I cannot use it to charge the phone. So, obviously it is not completely broken, but the pin that is used for charging seems damaged.\nHowever, if you look at the iPhone connector pinout, it seems like a diffferent pin is used for charging via USB (pin 18) than charging with FireWire (pins 19 and 20).\n\nSo, if I would get a FireWire-based charger, it might work? Does anyone know whether this really could solve the problem?\n\nA: Sadly you are out of luck, but it was a good idea!\nApple transitioned fully to charging over USB only, although for a while both Firewire and USB charging were an option.  This caused a bit of a row when it happened, because for years 3rd party manufacturers for charging docks and speaker docks etc never bothered to update their designs to use USB when warned that the Firewire was being deprecated by Apple.  So when they took out the relevant internals to support Firewire charging, you started to see messages like \"This accessory is not supported\"  and your device would suddenly no longer charge because the USB pinouts had not been internally implemented.\nHowever, naturally the 30 pin pinout of the dock connector remains the same spec, but referring to it does not mean that all functions that the cable specification supports will be available to the end device, and in your case an iPhone 4 will only charge over USB.\nI'll link you to a separate Q&A here that might assist in cleaning your connector up to make it work, sometimes a rigorous clean is all that is required.\n", "Q: Newly-created contacts in Outlook don't sync to iPhone I hope someone can give me some guidance relative to syncing contacts between Outlook and my iPhone 5. I can sync contacts I load on my phone to Outlook, however when I enter new contacts into Outlook those contacts do not sync to my phone.\nWhy do my new contacts created in Outlook not sync?\n\nA: In the case where you don't have a specific failure message or error, it's often best to isolate where the problem lies.\nIf you were using iCloud, I would recommend you add a contact from your computer then log into the web interface of iCloud to see that the change propagates to the cloud.\nIf it does, then you will know to focus on the cloud to iPhone part of the sync. If it does not, you can know that Outlook (or the PC end of things is failing.)\nYou can try these two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up syncing again on the guess that iOS isn't set up properly\n\n*Get access to the servers that are syncing the information and dig into the troubleshooting or logs that are available there to determine where the break down is happening.\n\n", "Q: NTFS write not working any more after update I searched for solutions to make OS X write NTFS disks, and found this one;\nHow do I write to NTFS drives in OS X?\nIt worked like a charm, until I updated my mac recently. Now it does not want to write to the NTFS disk anymore even with the nobrowse options. But nobrowse is still applied since the disk does not appear on my Desktop.\nThe writing is just disabled.\nAny reasons why the most recent version of OS X 10.8.5 does not allow to write to NTFS even with that uncomfortable way?\n\nA: I'd go with the first rule of computer troubleshooting, which basically says that if you installed something (application, driver, etc...) and then that functionality stops working after an O/S upgrade then reinstall the app's latest version.\nAlso good to double check that it is compatible with your version of the O/S ;-)\n\nA: Actually OS X allows native reading of NTFS disks, just not writing.\n", "Q: Can't plot with gnuplot on my Mac I am trying to plot with gnuplot on my Mac (OS X 10.8.5). I have installed X11 and XQuartz 2.7.4 and after that I installed gnuplot, but unfortunately gnuplot couldn't plot. \nSimple plots like the following fail to render and have no error message to help understand what is amiss:\n [1/10/13 $gnuplot >plot sin(x)\n\n\nA: The same thing happened to me, but then I ran \nbrew uninstall gnuplot; brew install gnuplot --with-x11\n\nand installed XQuartz. Now gnuplot supports the x11 terminal:\n\nYou can also save the output to a file and use qlmanage -p:\ngnuplot -e 'set term png; set output \"/tmp/plot.png\"; plot sin(x)'; qlmanage -p /tmp/plot.png\n\nqlmanage -p shows a sandboxing error in 10.9 and prints some unnecessary text to STDOUT, so I use a function like ql() { qlmanage -p \"$@\"&>/dev/null; } in shells.\nA third option is to use set term dumb for plain text output.\n\nA: Are you running this from a Terminal window, or an X11 window? The terminal will launch X11 separately to show the plot, so it may not be immediate (or visible). Does X11 get launched at all when you type your plot command?\nIf you try it in an X11 window, the result should be more immediate.\nAlso, if you used macports to install it originally, I would recommend using homebrew instead:\nbrew install gnuplot\n\nEDIT: To check where the output is going, you could direct your results to a file:\nset terminal png\nset output 'testimage.png'\nplot sin(x)\nexit\n\nThen see if a file called testimage.png contains your plot.\nYou could also try specifying the terminal with:\nset terminal x11\n\n\nA: In OS X Yosemite 10.10.2 and El Capitan 10.11.2, the Gnuplot does not package with XQuartz.\nAnswer in bibstha's comment.\nMuch more robust window manager is in qt and it works\n brew uninstall gnuplot\n brew install gnuplot --with-qt\n\nNote that using --qt is deprecated now.\n\nA: In Yosemite, \nInitially, I had quartz and gunplot 5.0.0 installed.

After downloading gunplot 5.0 and installing under Yosemite 10.10.2, gnuplot couldn't \"load\" the x11 terminal.  After pointing the configure file\nto /opt/X11/include (reconfiguring, remaking, and reinstalling) every worked fine.\n(I was surprised, too, that X11 is in /opt/X11.)\n\nA: Most of the advice here shows how to install/reinstall GNUPlot via brew. If you have an installation of GNUPlot and are unsure what terminal its using you can determine this like so:\n$ gnuplot <<<'show terminal'\n\n   terminal type is qt 0 font \"Sans,9\"\n\nAt which point we now know we're using the qt terminal type. With thin information now in hand you can decide on which course of action to take, either following one of the other answers to re-install GNUPlot via brew or configuring your existing terminal in whatever way you want via the set terminal .... . command.\n", "Q: Network Caller ID on iOS without a computer Network Caller ID (or NCID) allows incoming call information for a regular landline telephone to be sent over a local network to display on computers and other devices. There are programs for OS X that can handle this, and there's even one solution that broadcasts to iOS devices via a computer using the Prowl app.\nIs there is a solution to show NCID details on iOS that doesn't involve a computer?\n\nA: Since there didn't seem to be a stand-alone solution, I made a little app that connects to a NCID Server and gets the list of phone numbers:\nhttp://erike.net/ncid/\nUnfortunately Apple didn't allow me to keep the connection open in the background, but I may release a fix for this in Cydia.\n", "Q: Bash not running script at /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ I wanted to have bash autocompletion for git commands, so I dropped a bash script file into /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/.\nWhen I open a new Terminal, the script file in /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ does not get executed.

This loads the file and makes the functions available. i.e. put your source command in one of these files.\nNote that you should not be adding to /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ as only macports should write there.

So is it correct that my iPad2 runs iOS7 without this effect? I cannot find any documentation to confirm they left this feature out on iPad 2 but in on 4S.\n\nA: According to AnandTech (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7343/the-ios-7-review), the blur effect requires at least iPhone 4S or iPad 4.\n\nOn the iPhone side, the iPhone 4 lacks the cool blur effect in a number of places (notification center and control center are the most obvious), and iPad 3 does as well.\n\n\nA: iPad 2 had this effect until iOS 7 Beta 5.\n", "Q: Wallpaper Identification: Where can I find a better version of this?

I know Apple needs developers to be a part of the iOS Developer Program or Mac Developer Program to acquire several solutions and am interested in knowing how to start.\nWhat tools are needed for making my first app with Xcode and how would I start to become a developer using Apple's tools?\n\nA: The requirements to become a developer are quite low although the skills and attitude to do so effectively take time and training to perfect.\nTo get started using exclusively Apple's tools and free guidance, the initial investment needed in hardware and accounts is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Any Mac (used is fine) that runs Mountain Lion\n\n*An Apple ID to download Xcode with the current iOS / Mac SDK\n\n\nYou should perhaps budget a week of partial effort (several hours a night or half a day each weekend day) to start working through the introductory articles on http://developer.apple.com for either Mac or iOS. If you are not familiar with programming in C and some sort of graphical framework, your progress will be very slow as there will be an overwhelming amount of information (like trying to take a sip of water from a fire hydrant - rather than a water fountain).\nAfter a few hours of experimenting, you can have an informed opinion of how your development will progress and whether you'll want to take a guided course, spend time learning Cocoa or Objective-C or if you instead could use tools like RubyMotion to avoid needing to learn C, Objective-C or Cocoa.\nYou will at some point need a paid Mac Developer account to get access to prerelease software, Apple code level support, code signing credentials and access to the Mac App Store. Similarly, your iOS development will at some point need a paid developer membership for similar support and tools. These programs each cost $99 for a year of program benefits.\n\nA: The other thing you will need to become an apple developer apart from the ones listed above is an iPhone.  \nThe simulators that come with Xcode are good for testing your code runs, however to really make sure your app is behaving how you want it you will need several models of iPhone on hand to test.\n", "Q: iMessage won't send on iOS 7 With my iPhone 5 with iOS 7.0.2 on Wifi or on 3G my iMessages won't send (Progress bar stuck in the middle of the screen).\nRebooting or Airplane mode won't change anything. \n\nA: There seems to be a bug with iOS7 : \nTo make it work again here is a procedure : \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable iMessages (Settings > Messages) \n\n*Reset Network settings (Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network settings)\n\n*Enable iMessages (Settings > Messages)\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Emoji emoticons can be be an enhancing feature of a text-based conversation.

I would love to hear from people who have this setup.\n\nI have a 13\" retina MacBook Pro and a 23\" external display that I use for web development. It's actually a great setup since it makes it really easy to test how your designs look on both types of displays.\n\nIs it odd to move windows from one screen to the other and have things change from 1x to 2x and vice versa?\n\nWhen you move a window from one display to the other, you might notice it quickly redraw at 1x or 2x, though it's very brief.\nOne interesting thing is that windows have to be drawn at either 1x or 2x in their entirety, so if you position a window such that it spans both displays, it'll draw at the resolution of whichever display contains more of the window. It's rare that you ever position a window like that intentionally, though, so I wouldn't call it a problem.\nHonestly, the biggest problem you'll have once you get a retina display is that it'll make every other display you use look horrendous :-) Text in particular is an order of magnitude sharper, so I always run anything text-heavy (IDE, email, etc.) on the retina display.\n\nA: There is a momentary flicker when moving between displays, and it's very noticeable for non-native applications like Firefox.\nIf you can, I'd recommend waiting until next year for more-affordable 32\" 4K displays, which should work better in HiDPI modes.\n", "Q: iPad Controls and Locks Is there a way to lock kids out of settings and the controls for iPads?

Here you can not hide the App as such.\n\n*With Jailbreak you can hide apps from SB Settings, but as there is no Jailbreak you cannot use this right now.\n\n*The settings app can not be restricted as such right now, but you can use the Apple Configurator. I haven't used it myself but searching online forums show that this can be used.\n", "Q: Help!!!!!! downgrading iPhone i've just upgraded to ios 7.0.2 and i haven't saved the shsh blobs for my ios 6.1.3 ... iv'e purchased this iphone 2 months ago... can anyone give me shsh?? or how could i restore back to ios 6.1.3..... \nI really need help.. iOS 7 is little slow on the iPhone 4. :( Please help guys\nIve tried several things... \nlast 2 weeks, i had sucessfuly downgraded to ios 6.1.3 but for a jailbreak it bricked my device... and now i'm on iOS 7, i had to update to ios 7...\nMy iPhone is factory unlocked.. :/ \nplease help guys\n\nA: An SHSH Blob is device specific and meant to be like an individual fingerprint or ID number so that no two devices share the same identifier. \nIt uses the ECID (Exclusive Chip ID) of your device, along with a challenge key, as part of the authentication process with Apple. Thus anyone providing their own to you wont help you.\n\nA: I hate to tell you this, but you cannot save the SHSH blobs for your iPhone when it was back on iOS 6.1.3, even if that was a matter of 40 mins ago. It's gone, done and dusted.\nWhen the baseband was upgraded with iOS 7.0.2, you lost that ability, and there isn't anything anyone can do.\nSorry, you're just going to have to live with it and stop updating it until a new jailbreak comes out that you can use, but even then, you probably won't be able to downgrade.\nDowngrades are usually only available on the same series of a firmware, not cross-series. The only thing that would get you an iPhone with 6.1.3 back on there, would be if you damaged your phone and had insurance to cover it. Though, that's not even a guarantee. I'm sorry to say, but you're stuck where you are for now.\n", "Q: How can I import GoPro mp4 video to iMovie 11? I have video in an MP4 file from a GoPro camera.  It imports fine into iMovie on my iPad Mini and I can edit it there, but I'd rather edit in iMovie 11 on my Mac (OSX 10.9).  However, iMovie 11 won't import the GoPro MP4 video files.  \nThey play fine on Quicktime Player on the Mac, but iMovie refuses to import them.  Quicktime says the MP4 files contain \"GoPro AVC encoder, 1280x720 AAC, 48000 Hz stereo, 29.97 FPS\".  \nWhy does iPad iMovie work but not the iMovie 11?  Do I have to get a converter to convert to a different encoding?  If so, which encoding?\n\nA: This problem solved itself when I upgraded to the final OS 10.9 (Mavericks) and installed the latest iMovie.  Now I can import MP4 files from the GoPro right into iMovie.\n", "Q: How to pull Newsstand apps out of Newsstand, or else put other apps into Newsstand? I was happy to find that in iOS 7, Newsstand can finally be put into another folder. However, Newsstand, Passbook, FaceTime and the other default factory apps still cannot be removed from the phone (without jailbreaking). This is perfectly fine -- we can throw these apps on the last screen and ignore them, or at least that's the way it should be.\nIn fact, my New York Times app is stuck inside Newsstand and I cannot take it out. It is the only app in there. Ideally, I'd like to pull it out, throw it in my custom \"News\" folder, and throw Newsstand on screen infinity, never to be noticed again.\nBut I'd take another solution: Adding all my \"news\" apps to Newsstand. Unfortunately, Newsstand will not accept these apps (NPR, AP, Instapaper).\nIs there a way to put all these apps in the same, single folder?\n\nA: \nNote: with the release of iOS 9 you can now pull New York Times and other apps from Newsstand.\n\nWhat you ask isn't possible on stock iOS 7. Newstand subscriptions are not treated as full fledged apps or Safari bookmarks that can be placed arbitrarily on the springboard.\n", "Q: iPhone 5S cases compatible with Touch ID Can anyone recommend iPhone 5S cases that work well with the finger-print scanner? I know the cases Apple sells are compatible, but any others would be great. Please suggest with links. Thanks.\n\nA: I don't see the point why a normal iPhone 5 case not work for you as the physical dimensioning for both of them is same and the TouchID is on the Home Button and no Case in general covers that, So all the cases compatible with iPhone 5 will be compatible with iPhone 5S.\n", "Q: How do I make the iPhone app emulator retina-size? I'm developing an iPhone app and the only device I have for testing is an iPad 2. I can run the app on the iPad and it will use the internal iPhone emulator (or whatever it's called). But the display ratio is that of the older iPhones, not retina-size (see this, I need the last version). How do I change the aspect ratio?\n\nA: There is no option to change to retina or 4\" screen size for iPhone apps running on the iPad.  You should use the simulator in Xcode instead (or get another device).\n", "Q: IOS 7 Power Drain What settings minimize power loss on a 4S?  I upgraded to IOS 7 and have noticed a signiicant power drain\n\nA: I have an iPhone 4S running iOS 7 and these suggestions are based on my experiences with it.\nBackground App Refresh is a great new feature in iOS 7 which substantially reduces your battery life. The best way to reclaim that battery life is by restricting that feature to only the apps that absolutely need it.\nWhere to find it:\nGo the the Settings app, then go to \"General\" and then \"Background App Refresh\".\nStart from Zero\nMy recommendation? Turn off everything. Yeah, I know it stinks to lose the functionality, but give yourself a couple of days without it to get a sense of how long your iPhone lasts without them on. It did this and was amazed how much longer my batter was lasting. \nSet yourself a calendar reminder for +1 week to go back in and turn on just the ones you feel like you absolutely need/want. I did that too, and also made sure that my iPhone is plugged in when I am at my desk.\nOther Battery Life Tips\nOther than that, your battery should be pretty much the same as iOS 6. If that still doesn't help enough, try turning down the screen brightness to about 75% unless you are somewhere where you need to have it higher.\nMacworld did a good article (pre-iOS 7, however) about facts vs myths in iOS battery savings http://www.macworld.com/article/2046209/fact-or-fiction-nine-iphone-and-ipad-battery-saving-techniques-tested.html\n", "Q: FileVault 2 encrypted drive not accepting unlock password in recovery mode My Mid-2012 Mac Book Air running an up-to-date install of Mountain Lion crashed the other evening (browsing the web, one tab started beach-balling, and refused to be force-quit so I forced a restart).\nWhen restarting, it seems to accept my user's password to unlock the FileVault 2 encryption (I'm certain the password is correct, and typing a known incorrect password results in a shaky input field). The next screen is a grey screen, with a spinning progress wheel. Eventually a grey embossed sign is displayed, and that's about as far as it progresses. Booting using verbose mode (⌘+V) results in repeated lines of Still waiting for root device being logged.\nEntering recovery mode (⌘+R) to try and restore from a TimeMachine backup, or zap the drive and re-install from the internet gets me as far as a password input box requesting I \"Enter a password to unlock the disk Macintosh HD\", but I cannot get past this screen despite entering correct passwords for both users who have the ability to unencrypt the drive (And I think getting past the initial unlock screen with these passwords demonstrates that they work, but I'm happy to be corrected), with the password box just shaking and rejecting the password.\nAttempting to unlock the drive from the Terminal in Recovery Mode fails to mount the drive, but claims to have been unable to unencrypt it:\n-bash-3.2# diskutil cs unlockVolume XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\nPassphrase:\nStarted CoreStorage operation\nLogical Volume successfully unlocked\nLogical Volume successfully attached as disk13\nError: -69842: Couldn't mount disk\n\nI've run the hardware tests, and they showed no problems. I've seen this question describing similar symptoms, but that solution did not appear to help, with the password field of the Unlock Drive menu option in Recovery Mode's Disk Utility also rejecting the password.\nEssentially my question is \"how can I get my laptop back into a working state\"? I have recent TimeMachine backups, and so if the least painful is to format the drive and start again then I'm happy to do that, but at present I can't manage to get the drive wiped.\nI have my FileVault Encryption key if necessary.\n\nA: Just had this happen to me, error -69842 on a FileVault encrypted mid-2013 MacBook Air, and I spent a fair bit of time on it the last few days. I tried Recovery Mode, Target Disk Mode, fsck_hfs, and DiskWarrior with no luck. Disk Utility gave me an error 'Invalid thread record' or something like that. DiskWarrior indicated it was a 'disk hardware failure'. It was a corrupted FileVault volume no doubt.\nI was finally able to get at my files by booting up in single-user mode. Hold CommandS while booting. You'll have to pick a user and enter your password, then it'll drop you to command line. The encrypted volume that would otherwise fail to mount with Disk Utility or 'diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume' will be already mounted in your Unix shell. Apparently single-user mode bypasses whatever filesystem check is failing when an error unlocking occurs. Perhaps this is because no fsck is being run, I'm not sure.\nI was able to get my files off this way using a connected USB drive. Run mount -uw / && mkdir /Volumes/usb, then plug the USB in and do ls /dev/disk* to find the name. Mine was /dev/disk2s2, so mount_hfs /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/usb and I had a way to copy files off. Use mount_msdos instead of mount_hfs if you formatted it for non-Mac use. I selectively copied user folders one thumbstick at a time, but if you have a large enough USB drive attached then just do a tar czpf /Volumes/usb/Users-backup.tgz /Users to get a copy of the entire /Users folder in tar-gzip format.\nRecreating the FileVault volume is necessary. I did not find a way to repair it.\n\nA: To just delete the bad volume and start over type:\ndiskutil cs deleteVolume XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nAt that point the normal diskutil and Disk Utility steps will allow partitioning or just run the installer since your drive will effectively be empty (filled with random encrypted bits with the cs keys and file system structure effectively shredded)\nThis is a feature where you can cryptographically erase a drive by throwing away the container that allows the key to decrypt the data.

What are the steps to prevent complete restart cycle and still achieve the desired result?\nI remember I used to do a soft restart in terminal but now forgot the steps. After soft restart, the \"uptime\" command in terminal used to continue from previous uptime value, like \"up 20 days\".\n\nA: You can install updates without restarting by running sudo softwareupdate -i -a. It might cause some issues though. When I installed the 10.8.3 update without restarting, Safari started crashing on launch until I restarted the Mac.\nIf an installer or uninstaller forces you to restart, you can often just press command-Q to quit the installer.\nI haven't heard of anything like a soft restart. You can quit all applications by running sudo killall loginwindow, but it doesn't have the same effect as restarting or logging out and back in.\n", "Q: How do I tell OS X to always mirror displays when I plug them in?

It's minor, but annoying.\nIs there a way to tell OS X to default to mirror mode whenever I plug in a monitor? I looked in System Preferences -> Displays, but I couldn't find such an option.\n\nA: You didn't say what version of OS X you are using.

I use keyboard shortcuts a lot, one of my favourites is ctrl+F2 (access the menu-bar with the keyboard).\nHowever, sometimes this just stops working. Whenever this problem happens, ctrl+F3 (access the Dock using the keyboard) also stops working. Pressing ctrl+F2 jumps the selection to the bottom in Finder instead of opening the menu.\nThis happens in Mountain Lion and I remember that this also used to happen in Lion and Snow Leopard. I suspect it's something weird but deliberate, like accidentally performing an unknown shortcut that changes a setting somewhere.\nWhat causes this, how can I avoid it, and how do I rectify it when it happens?\n\nA: I think I have figured this out:\nctrl+F1 apparently turns keyboard access on/off, which disables the other shortcuts. So I have now disabled this shortcut and hopefully the others will no longer get accidentally disabled.\nIf this happens to you, try ctrl+F1 to re-enable.

Every night, I put it to Sleep rather than shutting it down. Since about two weeks ago, the Mac Mini wakes up from sleep around 1 to 3 am, once a night, and then after about 10 seconds, it puts itself back to sleep. Why does it do this? Is it performing some sort of maintenance function? But that then begs the question, why is it only doing this recently, and not a few months ago?\nI checked the Console for messages, and there's roughly the same thing every night. Here's part of what appears in the logs, particularly whatever pertains to waking from sleep (let me know if you need me to post a specific snippet):\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: AppleThunderboltNHIType2::waitForOk2Go2Sx - retries = 6\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: IOThunderboltSwitch<0xffffff8048e40000>(0x0)::listenerCallback - Thunderbolt HPD packet for route = 0x0 port = 12 unplug = 0\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: TBT W (2): 0x0100 [x]\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: Wake reason: EC.SleepTimer (SleepTimer)\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: Previous Sleep Cause: 5\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: The USB device USB 3.0 HUB\nSep 14 02:00:30 gary-mac kernel[0]: (Port 1 of Hub at 0x15000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a remote wakeup (1)\n\nI'm sure there's something useful in there (such as references to the USB ports) but I can't exactly figure them out. For your information, my Mac Mini has four USB ports, and all four are used. USB port 1 is an external drive, USB port 2 is an external drive, USB port 3 is connected to a KVM, which provides access to my mouse and keyboard, and USB port 4 is connected to a USB 3 hub that splits the port into four other ports.\nWhen I go to the System Information app to determine what device is at USB location 0x15000000, I get the following:\nUSB 3.0 HUB:\n\nProduct ID: 0x0812\nVendor ID:  0x2109  (VIA Labs, Inc.)\nVersion:    85.71\nSpeed:  Up to 5 Gb/sec\nManufacturer:   VLI Labs, Inc. \nLocation ID:    0x15100000 / 3\nCurrent Available (mA): 900\nCurrent Required (mA):  0\n\nIt just looks like a generic device of some sort. Right above this device in the System Information app is the first USB device I have connected, which is my external drive for Time Machine. Could that be the problem somehow, even though its device location is 0x15400000 / 4?\nCould this problem be due to the recently released Mac OS X 10.8.5? It seems like the problem started occurring a few days after the update was released. I have already performed the basic maintenance of resetting the SMC and PRAM, and Repairing Disk Permissions, but that didn't fix the problem. Also, in the System Preferences -> Energy Saver page, I've got all checkboxes UNchecked (including \"Wake for network access\"). I haven't had any other wake issues since this started happening. Plus, the fact that the Mac Mini goes back to sleep after a few seconds doesn't seem to indicate that it could possibly be a network access problem, or a mouse randomly moving, right?\n\nA: I'd eliminate any external devices as the cause of waking first. You can set the MacMini to go to sleep automatically, then eject/unplug all external devices.  KVM & Mice are the usual suspects...  \n\n(Port 1 of Hub at 0x15000000) may have caused a wake by issuing a\n  remote wakeup (1)\n\nIf you haven't already, you may be able to identify the USB device suspected of issuing the remote WakeUp call. \nAbout this Mac > System Report > Hardware > USB > USB Device Tree \nor use the shell command system_profiler SPUSBDataType\n\nA: This issue reminds me of the behaviour of Wake on Demand and Bonjour Sleep Proxy.  See Apple HT3774, which includes:\n\n... your Mac will occasionally wake for a brief time, without lighting the screen, in order to maintain active shared service registrations with the Bonjour Sleep Proxy. On some Macs, sounds from the optical drive, hard drive, or fans may be heard during these brief periods.\n\nHowever... you do say that \"Wake for network access\" is unchecked, so I think the behaviour you are seeing is not expected.\nI would try turning off WiFi before putting your Mac mini to sleep, and see if that stops it waking up.  (That probably isn't a great solution, but it might be the first step in finding one...)\n\nA: I hadn't actually gotten around to doing any testing on this problem yet. However, I updated my Mac to 10.8.5 with the OS X v10.8.5 Supplemental Update released yesterday (or a few days ago), and the problem stopped occurring this morning. Of course, I'll wait a week to determine if it's really fixed or not, but it looks like this update fixed the problem. Which would indicate that it was a bug in OS X all along.\nIn particular, it looks like Fixes an issue that may cause external drives to be ejected after the computer goes to sleep was the problem.\n", "Q: Magsafe light occasionally turns off while plugged in Every once in a while, the green light on my Magsafe adapter will turn off, but the computer will indicate that it's still running off of AC power.

The main way to do this is to use a software like gfxCardStatus.  \nHowever, since my Macbook wasn't booting (stuck on blue screen after Apple logo), I managed to disable my AMD Radeon HD 6490M by entering single-user mode and deleting the following files from /System/Library/Extensions/:\nAMDRadeonAccelerator.kext\nAMDRadeonVADriver.bundle\nAMDRadeonX3000GLDriver.bundle\nAMDRadeonX4000GLDriver.bundle\nATI2400Controller.kext\nATI2600Controller.kext\nATI3800Controller.kext\nATI4600Controller.kext\nATI4800Controller.kext\nATI5000Controller.kext\nATI6000Controller.kext\nATI7000Controller.kext\nATIFramebuffer.kext\nATIRadeonX2000.kext\nATIRadeonX2000GA.plugin\nATIRadeonX2000GLDriver.bundle\nATIRadeonX2000VADriver.bundle\nATISupport.kext\n\n3 - Remaining problems\nBut, as I said, this is just a workaround to get OS X to boot.

The Intel HD 3000 chipset may not be a killer GPU, but I am sure it can handle a simple video, and even 1080p videos.\nWhen I open a video file in VLC, I get the following error:\n\nOpenGL acceleration is not supported on your Mac\n  Your Mac lacks Quartz Extreme acceleration, which is required for video output. It will still work, but much slower and with possibly unexpected results.\n\nAnd in the logs:\n\nvout_macosx error: no OpenGL hardware acceleration found. this can lead to slow output and unexpected results\n\nI think Mac OS X is trying to get OpenGL acceleration thanks to the AMD GPU. And since the GPU is supposed to work properly, it never tries to get the adequate features from the Intel HD 3000 chipset.\nSo, is there any way to get more from this chipset?\n\nA: I'm having the same issue with GPU on my MBP 2011 and was using the same solution as yours (plus additionally disabled AppleIntelHD3000Graphics.kext).

In short, looks like I'm fixed in similar fashion; however, I only removed the ATIRadeonX2000.kext file (I believe the 15\" equivalent is the 3000. i have done some limited testing (Apature and MKV file with VLC), both say \"Requires High Performance GPU\" in the activity monitor, but they run. Don't use external monitors, so we'll see where it comes up short.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I had the same problem and disabled the drivers in single user mode.

This themeing does not extend into apps, and is simply a pre-chosen wallpaper.  It has no relevance for any other phone model, or iPad.\n\nA: There aren't any themes in iOS 7.

So, that can be the reason...\n", "Q: Can I install 64 bit software on a 32 bit OS X - 10.5.8 - Leopard? Can I install 64 bit software on a 32 bit OS X?\nOr could I \"update\" my 32 bit OS X to 64 bit OS X? \nThis is what I get when I put uname -a  in a terminal:\nDarwin gaukhar-alibayevas-macbook.local 9.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 9.8.0: \nWed Jul 15   16:55:01 PDT 2009; root:xnu-1228.15.4~1/RELEASE_I386 i386\n\n\nA: Short answer: if your model of MacBook has a 64-bit capable CPU, you can run 64-bit apps under 10.5.8. You can check the CPU with the command sysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable (0 means no, 1 means yes) or by looking up the model (if it has a \"Core Solo\" or \"Core Duo\" CPU it's 32-bit only; if it's a \"Core 2 Duo\" -- note the \"2\" -- it's 64-bit).\nLong answer: OS X doesn't have 32-bit and 64-bit versions; it uses a universal binary format which allows programs, system components, etc to be installed with both 32- and 64-bit code, and the system simply picks the \"best\" one to use based on the CPU you're on. Over different versions of OS X, what comes with the OS has gradually migrated from 32-bit-only (through 10.2) to having minimal support for background-only 64-bit apps (10.3 and 10.4), to full support for 64-bit Cocoa apps (10.5), to a full 32/64 OS including the kernel (10.6) to actually starting to drop support for 32-bit mode (10.7 shipped with many 64-bit-only system apps, and will not run on a 32-bit-only CPU).\nThe 64-bit-capable kernel that was added in 10.6 is cool, but basically irrelevant to user applications. OS X is unusual in that it can transparently run 64-bit apps under a 32-bit kernel as well as 32-bit apps under a 64-bit kernel. Since 10.5 has full support for 64-bit Cocoa apps, upgrading to 10.6 is not necessary.\nAdendum: even if you do upgrade to 10.6, the kernel may not actually run in 64-bit mode -- Apple configured it to boot in 32-bit mode on most models by default. If your model uses 64-bit EFI firmware, you can configure 10.6 to boot in 64-bit mode, but if it's an older one that uses 32-bit EFI, even that's not possible. But again, it doesn't really matter, since 64-bit apps work fine either way.\n\nA: This can get pretty complex pretty quickly, but the short version is that if you are running Snow Leopard or later, on a Mac that is running on a Core 2 Duo Intel chip (or newer) then you can run 64 bit apps.\nYou should note that there is no distinction between the 32bit and 64bit versions of OSX, the difference is in the EFI which is essentially the firmware controlling the interface between your OS and your hardware.  Some older Macs come with a 32 bit EFI, some with 64 bit.  In this exmaple you will see mine is running a 64 bit EFI.\nStuffeMac:~ stuffe$ ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi\n| |   \"firmware-abi\" = <\"EFI64\">\nStuffeMac:~ stuffe$ \n\nSo, up to now you know that if you have a 64 bit EFI on the right CPU hardware, you are good to go with 64 bit, and it will boot into a 64 bit kernel at the operating system level, and allow you to run 64 bit apps.\nHowever, there are exceptions, in that some fully 64 bit Macs still boot into 32bit mode by default.  Whatever your system default, you can attempt the opposite by holding down 3 and 2 on bootup, or 6 and 4, however this was very much a short term issue for certain macs when running Snow Leopard, and is largely a non issue now on newer macs/OS.\nYou can see which kernel you are using in System Profiler:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose About This Mac from the Apple () menu.\n\n*Click More Info. \n\n*Click System Report (Optional step dependant on OS level)\n\n*Select Software in the Contents pane.\n\n*Look for \"64-bit Kernel and Extensions: Yes (or No)\" under the System Software Overview heading.\n\n\nAnd now for the final kicker, any Mac running on the above CPU spec, irregardless of if they have a 32 bit or 64 bit EFI, and irregardless of if they are then booted into 32 bit or 62 bit kernels can still run 64 bit apps on top of a 32 bit OS kernel(!), which is pretty damn cool, not to mention highly unusual for most desktop class OS, as this note from a good review of 10.6 shows when discussing the 64 bit question.:\n\nFinally, this is worth repeating: please keep in mind that you do not need to run the 64-bit kernel in order to run 64-bit applications or install more than 4GB of RAM in your Mac. Applications run just fine in 64-bit mode on top of the 32-bit kernel, and even in earlier versions of Mac OS X it's been possible to install and take advantage of much more than 4GB of RAM.\n\n\nA: No, it is not possible to run 64 bit software on a 32 bit computer.\nIf your MacBook contains a 64 bit CPU, then you can upgrade to a later version of Mac OS X and run 64 bit applications. To tell if your Mac is 64 bit capable, use the following command in Terminal.app:\nsysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable\n\n", "Q: iPhone4 can't access iCloud after upgrade to iOS 7.0.2 Software upgrade seems to have worked fine but settings->icloud is disabled.

I want to add the menu items:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"New File\"\n\n*\"Open Terminal Here\"\n\n*etc.\n\n\nI've searched a bit for these but haven't found anything of substance; I could set up a hacky hotkey workaround but that's suboptimal, in my experience. So any recommendations are more than welcome!\n\nA: This is a bit old, but nothing is drastically different in 10.8:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100509134904820\n\nThis a simple Service for creating new files the currently-open folder in Finder, using AppleScript and Automator. \nStart by launching Automator, and in the chooser that appears, select Service. This will open a new Automator window, set up to create a Service. In that window, do the following:\n  Set the Service to receive selected folders in Finder (the two drop-down menus at the top of the work area on the right). This makes it easier to assign a keyboard shortcut to our service, which we'll do at the end.\nDrag and drop the 'Run AppleScript' action (in the Utilities Library) into the work area on the right.\nPaste in the following AppleScript, then click the Hammer icon (to compile the code):\n\non run {input, parameters}\n  tell application \"Finder\"\n    set currentPath to insertion location as text\n    set x to POSIX path of currentPath\n  end tell\n  return x\nend run\n\n\nDrag and drop the 'Set value of a variable' action from the Utilities Library, and create a new variable called, for example, CurrentFolder. (Do this by clicking on the drop-down menu.)\nDrag and drop the New Text File action from the Text library into the work area. Then drag CurrentFolder from the Variable panel at the bottom of the Automator window to the Where entry of the New Text File action. Click the Options button in the action, and click the 'Show this action when the workflow runs' box. This makes it possible to change the name and extension of the new file.\nSave the service as 'Create New File,' or whatever you like. Test your new action using the Services menu in Finder, to make sure it works (select a folder, Control-click, and you should see your new Service at the bottom of the contextual menu).\nOn the Keyboard Shortcuts tab of the Keyboard System Preferences panel, select Services in the left-hand column, and your new service (it should be in the Files and Folders section) in the right-hand panel. Assign a keyboard shortcut to the new Service by double-clicking to the right of the Service's name.\nSwitch back to Automator and change the leftmost drop-down menu (at the top of the work area) to No Input, then save the Service again.\n\n\nA: Terminal provides Services to open a new terminal window or tab with the current directory set to a folder selected in Finder.\nYou can enable these Services in\n\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\nThe services are named “New Terminal at Folder” and “New Terminal Tab at Folder”. Once enabled, they will appear in the Services submenu of the application menu (the one whose title is the name of the current application) and in the Services submenu of the contextual menu.\n\nA: This app (link to website) http://zipzapmac.com/Go2Shell if free on the app store - it opens a terminal window for the current folder\n\nA: I too was searching for a way to customize the right-click menu in Finder. By default you can add Services and Open With... menu items, but those are stuck under a submenu and contain way too many items.\nSo, I created a Mac application that can customize the main context menu itself.\n\nService Station:\nMac App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/service-station/id1503136033/\n\nService Station allows you to add custom menu items on a per-filetype basis. So you can set up different apps for when you right-click image files, text files, or the background of the Finder folder itself.\nIt can also run AppleScript, shell scripts, or Automator Workflows.\n\nI'd really like to add a \"New File\" option right under \"New Folder\" in the right click menu, and just have it make a new file in the selected folder or finder window.\n\nThis can be scripted via AppleScript and added to a Service Station menu. I will likely add native \"New File\" functionality in the future for Windows converts :)\n\nOn top of that, it'd be really killer to have an \"open terminal here\" option that would open a terminal window already cd'd into the current working directory.\n\nThis is one of the default menu items for Folders. Right-click any folder and select \"Terminal\" to open a pre-cd'd Terminal window to that directory:\n\nDownload Service Station on the Mac App Store, or more details at ServiceStation.menu.\n\nA: To create a new file in one click, you want to use AppleScript to extend the Finder, which can be packaged as a droplet (a button inside the Finder toolbar, which is accessible from any Finder window).\nAfter searching the web for more than one hour, I finally found a link which explains you to do just that, here you go:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140422030842/http://blog.themeforest.net/general/amp-up-productivity-with-os-x-finder-droplets/\nIn a nutshell:\n\n*\n\n*Create an AppleScript file as per the official applescript reference\n\n*Package as droplet by placing within a {name}.app folder with relevant metadata as explained in this droplet oriented tutorial\nYou can use https://github.com/RichardBronosky/AppleScript-droplet as an example skeleton if you struggle (it's opinionated, but very simple).\n\nA: Following tool allows you to open terminal from any directory or to create a new file in a directory using the right click menu. The tool also allows you to write simple shell scripts to add more custom options to the right click menu. The tool is free and there is a GitHub link on the tool's page if you want to check the source.\nYou can get the tool here:\nhttps://samiyuru.com/project/macOS-finder-right-click-menu\n", "Q: Removing or transferring iOS app license Simple question:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a TomTom application that was on 5 devices (maximum allowed)\n\n*One of the devices (let's call it D-Vice) breaks/gets lost \n\n*How do I transfer the license from D-Vice to a new device?\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: You may be confusing the limit of 5 devices that can automatically download new purchases with the ability to sign in and download a past purchase.\nYou can simply sign in to the App Store on the new device, navigate to purchases and re-download TomTom.\nThe current terms of service do not limit personal use of apps on multiple devices. You should read the license if you are using the software commercially where the terms specify one license per device or one license per person, but the enforcement is social and not technical. The store doesn't ask when you sign in whether you are licensing something personally or professionally.\n\nA: The device limit applies only for those devices where \"Automatic Downloads\" or iTunes Match are turned on.\nSnippet from iLounge on \"More than five family devices sharing a single iTunes account\":\n\nActually, the limit of five devices per iTunes Store account only applies to authorizations for computers using iTunes. Apple actually allows you to have up to ten devices authorized in total for features such as iTunes Match and re-downloading previous purchases from iTunes in the Cloud, up to five of which can be computers running iTunes. So in other words, you could have anywhere from 10 iOS devices and no computers up to five computers and five iOS devices or any combination in between. You can view the number of devices that have been authorized for these features by going into your iTunes Store account information from within iTunes and choosing the Manage Devices option.\n\n\nIf you wish to remove the broken or lost device from your account (to avoid issues in the future with respect to other content or automatic downloads), follow Apple's instructions for Removing an associated device or computer from an Apple ID:\n\nTo remove a device or computer from your Apple ID:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes.\n  \n*Sign in to your Apple ID by choosing Store > Sign In from the iTunes menu.\n  \n*Choose Store > View My Account from the iTunes menu. \n  \n*From the Account Information screen, click Manage Devices.\n  \n*Click the Remove button next to the device name you would like to unassociate.\nNote: Removing a device from your Apple ID does not override the 90 day timer. The timer must complete 90 days from the day the device was associated before it can be associated to another Apple ID.\n\n", "Q: Problem with changing Apple ID on iPhone My original Apple ID was associated with an email address that is not valid anymore. I updated my Apple ID to a real valid email. I managed to update it successfully with everything except iCloud on my phone. The App Store, iTunes, and everything else on my phone has the correct ID except iCloud.\nWhen I try to delete my iCloud account from Setting > iCloud > Delete Account, I am asked to enter my password for the old email address, when I do so, I get a reply that the password is wrong.  When I try to retrieve it, I am asked for my date of birth, and then told that it is also wrong.\nHow can I change to my new Apple ID?\n\nA: One new feature of iOS 7 is an activation lock - and this means that you can't sign out or erase the device without entering the proper password for the account to which your device has been locked.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818\nTowards the bottom of the article, it has a link to use My Apple ID web page to check and reset your password if you have forgotten it.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/\nPresumably, if you can't reset the password, you might need to reach out to Apple directly and see if there is an administrative process such as mailing them proof of purchase or correctly answering questions about past billing events to have them reset the account password.\n\nA: You don't need to delete the account on the iPhone.  Go to iCloud settings and tap on the top line (the one with your old Apple ID). Then enter your new login details on the following screen. \n\nA: You change the Apple ID and password as described in App Store. After that you delete old Apps whichever software you want to update. If you attempt to update old apps, it will ask for the password to the old Apple ID.\nTherefore, after deleting the old apps, you need to go to the App Store search and download the software again using the new Apple ID where the new password will be accepted.\n\nA: Turn off find my phone.  It will ask for password of old id. Entered pass for old id(email address I no longer use) and it turned off find my phone.  Hit home then settings then iCloud just fill in new id and pass.  Took me a bit but figured it out.\n", "Q: How do I open TCP ports 7080 and 7090 for use with Merlin? I'm trying to set up Merlin server on my Mac to send a GANTT chart to my iPad.

I'm not sure of the consistency but sometimes OS X makes hidden .filename files where filename is a name of another file in the same directory. I want to know how to disable this since USBs I insert and copy / move files to / from keep having this and it's annoying to have to delete them every time I plug the USB onto a non-Mac computer.\n\nA: What format is the volume in? If you mean the AppleDouble files that start with ._, they are not normally created on HFS volumes. They are used to store metadata like extended attributes, ACLs, and resource forks on non-HFS volumes.\nYou can delete the ._ files with find:\nfind /Volumes/volume -name ._\\* -delete\n\nIf the volume is in an HFS format, you can use dot_clean to remove the ._ files after merging the metadata stored in them with the metadata stored in native formats:\ndot_clean /Volumes/volume\n\n\nA: The easiest way to handle this (with a commercial program though) seems to be to use BlueHarvest (hat tip to this answer on superuser). Note that BlueHarvest does not prevent the creation of these files. It continuously monitors non-Mac drives and cleans them up. It can also be used to manually clean up a volume/folder/file.\nFor other alternatives (some with limitations), see:\nIs there any way to prevent a Mac from creating dot underscore files? - from superuser.com\nBlueHarvest Alternatives for Mac OS X\nYou can also use the solution below to replace the standard umount (unmount) program with a wrapper script to clean up these files when you eject the MSDOS formatted drive:\n\"Automatically delete Mac OS X dot files from MS-DOS filesystems\" - Feb 07, '11\n", "Q: What is answering at port 80 when httpd is down?

If I want to turn off data roaming do I leave it so that the button is to the left (only white) or do it push it to the right (where the color green appears on the left of the button).\nIn case you're wondering why I find it confusing: I can interpret it as \"yes, I want to turn data roaming off\" -- in which case I would slide the button to the right. Or I could just read it as \"Data Roaming\" and deactivate it by sliding it to the left. \n\nA: You enable Data Roaming when showing the green part to the left.\nOn iOS 6 and older you had the text ON or OFF on the button. OFF disabled Data Roaming, and ON enabled Data Roaming and the button was showing a blue background behind the ON. So on iOS 7 you have the same behavior - just without the ON/OFF text, and with a green background - you can however turn on an 1 as ON and a 0 as OFF under Settings=>General=>Accessibility=>On/Off Labels)\n\nA: The button turned to the right showing a green color means that \"Yes Data roaming is On\" and the other way means \"Data Roaming off\"\n\nA: I have to admit, I've just had the same problem and this indicators are confusing !\nIf you goto Settings->General->Accessibility->On/Off Labels and enable that, it makes it \"a little clearer\".\n", "Q: New SATA cable, same hard drive problem I was having hard drive problems with my mid-2010 unibody Macbook Pro. I bought a new hard drive and set up it using a SATA to USB cable before installing. Everything worked great so long as I had the drive hooked up via USB, but when I installed it in the machine, the machine would not boot from it. If I held down option+R during startup, it would not find the new disk.\nSo I ordered a new SATA cable for the Macbook Pro and installed it. Still nothing. Am I missing a step or should I assume the problem is somewhere else in the computer? Would love your thoughts/wisdom.\n\nA: I would take the MacBook into Apple or an authorised repairer to have them examine it. Possible damaged mobo or connectors inside the MacBook that are causing you the grief.\n", "Q: Erase a 1st gen iPad I have a 1st gen iPad that I don't know the passcode for. iTunes tells me that I need to enter the passcode before I can use it with iTunes.\nSo I followed some instructions and put the iPad into Recovery mode, which let me connect to iTunes and hit the Restore button.\niTunes apparently will not let me just restore the iPad using the iOS version it currently has; instead it demands that I let it download a new iOS version first.\nBut my internet is so slow and unreliable where I live now that I have not been able to get iTunes to finish downloading.\nSo I found a website that lets you download IPSW's.  I downloaded 5.1 for iPad 1st gen. I then held Option while clicking Restore in iTunes, chose this IPSW file, and iTunes told me it is not valid.\nSo....\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way I can use this iPad as-is without knowing the passcode?\n\n*Is there any way I can restore it without downloading any huge IPSW files?\n\n*If not, is there any other way I can get rid of the passcode or wipe the device clean?\n\n*I welome jailbreaking and 3rd-party software in my quest...\n\n\nA: The iPad 1 should be good to go for a valid version of 5.1.1\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.icj.me/ios/all#iPad11\nI'd say the easiest thing to do would be to take the iPad to a copy of iTunes that has a good internet connection or download a reputable copy (for whatever reputable means to you) of 5.1.1 IPSW and use your iTunes to wipe and restore the iPad.\nJailbreaking might be an option, but I'd go with easy.\n\nA: Enter the wrong passcode 10 times to erase the device. Later in the process, like after try 6 the wait starts to get longer before it will let you try again.

I have a iPhone4 (iOS 5.0.1 [9A405]), and I noticed that from time to time instead of the typing indicator (...) I can see the part of the future message that I'm just about to receive.\nIs this a security issue?\nHow does the typing indicator work? Is it possible that it sends some sort of key-codes over the iMessage IM network?\n\nA: This isn't something I have ever seen reported before, and it seems unlikely that you can see the message before it is sent, but then again to use the popular Photo sharing app Instagram as an example they start uploading the photo as soon as you take it, before you tag it or write your comments etc, then when you click upload it's already most of teh way there and they can just add the extra info.  So it's not out of the bounds of possibility that iMessage works in a similar way to increase the perceived speed of delivery by essentially streaming it to the recipient who is then instructed to mask it with the dots until it received the all clear signal, as it were.\nThere's no real way for us to know this is happening, and all iMessage communication is encrypted too, so hard to find out with snooping etc.  I would ask if the partial message you see before receiving the real thing is always the same as the actual text you receive, or if it ever changes, i.e. are you seeing genuine updates as they are type, or is the system tripping up and just flicking between showing your the message and the dots?\n", "Q: What sub-format of Word document does Pages use for export? I am using Pages '09 (v 4.3) and LibreOffice under OSX. When exporting a document from Pages into Word format, I am unable to open it in LibreOffice. (I would swear I had done this successfully many times before.) I think LibreOffice doesn't know which of the many Word formats to use. It shows me these specific options in the Open dialog:\n\nI was assuming it was not the most current because the extension is .doc instead of .docx but I tried changing the ext and it still fails to open correctly. \nAny tips on which of the formats to select or how to get my document to open in LibreOffice? (I need to do \"compare two documents\".)\n\nA: I just tried this out – The following happened.\nWRONGE way:\nOpen a new document in Pages, File -> Export To (Word..) -> Advanced Options -> Choose .docx format.\nLibreOffice crashes everytime I try to open the file.\nRIGHT way:\nOpen a new document in Pages, File -> Export To (Word..) -> Advanced Options -> Choose .doc format.\nThen it opens fine in LibreOffice. \nNOTE: This was tested in Pages version 5.0\nPS: Didnt see the post before me. Sorry about that.\nPPS: It seems you are trying to open a specific format, but the problem is really the way you export it in the first place.

How?\nI guess this is a Google Chrome issue, but triggered in OS X because it hides file extensions by default? I'm not sure how it works and what triggers this, but I'd just like to have the downloaded file's name not to be messed with.\nYou're offered the option of which extension to use, but sometimes, even if you choose the right extension, it still screws up the filename.\n\n\nA: Go to the Chrome menu and select preferences. Scroll to the bottom of the preference window and click on Advanced. This lets you scroll down to a 2nd page off options that you can use or turn off. Two of the first options refer to using a Prediction service for loading web pages. You can try turning one or both of these off to get rid of your problem.\n\nA: OS X does not change extension of your downloaded file. Do you have any example (i.e., link) where Chrome does this?\n\nA: Sadly in my opinion Apple went a little too far in \"helping the user\" with this. When I try to save a .img file from a website, if I have \"Show all file extensions\" turned off in Finder> Preferences> Advanced, then it automatically renames the file with a .dmg extension, which is NOT the same thing and most applications that work with .img files don't understand or allow selecting a .dmg file in their file browser.\nLuckily the fix is simply to check the box for \"Show all file extensions\" and then just make sure you don't remove an existing extension when downloading from a website. If a download doesn't have or offer an extension, you can usually add .pdf as the Preview application can handle almost every type of text/image/pdf/video out there, and if it can't, then you probably need to use a command line tool like file to guess at the type of file it REALLY is. file --help in Terminal will get you started.\nOne thing to note is that file extensions are primarily for humans, computers can use \"magic\" file headers or a mime type examination to figure out what program can handle a file, but humans think we know best, which is why we want to manage or override \"file handlers\", but often things \"just work\" if we don't go messing with them too much.\n", "Q: In Disk Utility, does Secure Erase include the Erase Free Space option ...or do I need to Erase Free Space as well as Erase with secure option. I'm prepping a Mac for resale.\n\nA: Secure Erase supersedes Erase Free Space because it zaps the entire disk instead of just zapping a subset of the disk marked 'free space.' If you want to be sure the NSA can't read this disk, do the Most Secure 7-pass erasure.\nBTW: The 7-pass job takes lots of time (many hours to days) and gives the disk a good thrashing, too. Its a good stress test.\n", "Q: Does OSX Lion come with iPhoto? I need iPhoto, but I don't know if I deleted it or I just never had it to begin with.  I'm currently running OSX Lion.\n\nA: Lion (or any other OS X operating system) doesn't come with iPhoto by default. However, iPhoto, iMovie, and Garageband are normally installed on new systems.\nYou'll have to install iPhoto if it's not on your system. Each new Mac does get some version of iLife, so you may be able to check from Apple the version of the OS that shipped with your hardware at http://apple.com/support/manuals and search to see what your options are.\n\nA: iPhoto and indeed the rest of the iLife range of apps is provided free of charge with new Mac hardware.  If you bought your Mac from new, then you will have either the discs/USB install stick with the software on, or a license for the apps against your Apple ID in the Mac App Store; the age of your Mac decides which install medium you were provided with.  If you bought your Mac 2nd hand, then unless it originally came with physical media that was also passed onto you, or was left installed on the OS, then you are out of luck.\n", "Q: install NTFS system checks? I have a external hard drive and I'm checking it with the Disk Utility. However, it gave me an error says \n** No NTFS file system checks have been implemented yet.\n\nHow can I install one?\n\nA: OS X supports the option to read NTFS-formatted drives, but has not supported writing to these drives. Therefore, the use of a third-party driver such as Paragon NTFS or Tuxera NTFS has been required for those seeking full NTFS support; however, OS X does support writing to NTFS, but this feature is just not enabled by default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable NTFS option via Terminal (I am not going to document this, as I highly do not recommend using this option at all, unless you are aware of the problems this will lead to)\n\n*Download and install SL-NTFS which is an NFTS writing preference for your Mac. Works on Mac OS X 10.6+ (FREE)\n\n*Install NTFS-3G, though this is not my favourite option. It's a little slow and can cause compatibility issues with anything after Mac OS X 10.6. Some users report it working flawlessly. I personally think it's write capability is a little slow. Touch and go. (FREE)\n\n*Paragon NTFS which is approx $20, is the entry-level of paid software version. I have used this for quite a while and never had a problem. Works on anything from Mac OS X 10.6.x → 10.8.x\n\n*Tuxera NTFS costs approx $32 and does everything that Paragon NTFS does. I use this one now, because it built upon the NTFS-3G option I mentioned earlier. I personally believe it works the best as I have never had an issue with it to date, but then I have used all options (aside #2) and found no issues with any of them.\n\n\nTo solve your enquiry, either NTFS-3G, Paragon or Tuxera will all enable you to use Disk Utility to check the drive, format the drive, etc etc. The picture below is from my system.\nNOTE: I am not saying SL-NTFS will not do what you want, I just have not tested it.\n\n", "Q: Revoke an applications access to keychain passwords I granted an application 'always allow' access to my keychain, i no longer want to have this application set to this, is there a central place where i can see which applications are allowed to access items / passwords in the keychain and then remove them as wanted ?\n\nA: security is a command-line program which can access/manipulate the keychains.

(Most, but not all, keychain items do.  For example, the public portion of my S/MIME certificate does not have one, presumably since it is a public key and thus does not need to be protected—but the corresponding key, available under Keys, does.)\nSimply find the keychain item in question and press command-I (or select Get Info from the File menu).

Is there a way to do this in Keychain Access? (I am running OS X Server).\n\nA: Unfortunately, Keychain Access (Certificate Assistant) does not have the ability to include a CRL Distribution Point inside of a certificate's extensions section in certificates that it generates. You'll likely notice that your current CA does not have a CRL distribution point specified (even if you've enabled CRL signing as an allowed usage of that certificate during creation.)\nIt just works!\nInterestingly enough, when setup as an Open Directory master, OS X Server automatically creates a self-signed certificate authority along with an Intermediate CA - both of which possess a CRL distribution point (with a format similar to: http://server.example.com:1640/rfc2585/Example.crl.) These certificates are not generated by Certificate Authority, but by xscertd-helper, which is forked by slapconfig during Open Directory setup and configuration. If your machine were already running Open Directory, you could use slapconfig (mainly xscertd-helper) to:\n\n*\n\n*Create a self-signed certificate authority\n\n*Sign an intermediate authority cert (both containing CRL distribution points on the OD server \"server.example.com\")\n\n*Store both certificates in the System keychain and LDAP \"Certificate Authorities\" container\n\n*Create and update CRLs at /var/db/crls automatically\n\n*Respond to SCEP requests on port 1640 (xscertd)\n\nFrom the slapconfig man page, the command that you can use to recreate the CA setup used by Open Directory (note: this is part of the OD setup process and is unnecessary in most situations) is:\n-createrootcertauthority <Certificate Authority Name> <Certificate Authority Admin Email> <Certificate Authority Organization Name>\nCreate a CA on the OD master.\n\nUnfortunately, slapconfig will check to confirm that the machine is an OD master before allowing this setup to commence. Although you can trick it into performing a few steps by setting false flags in plist files (/Library/Preferences/com.apple.openldap.plist), the software eventually makes LDAP queries to the local node, and fails to find the node responding (or fails to find the certificationAuthority object class).\nThere is a utility named xscertadmin that can be used (by humans!) to add items to the CRL distribution list. However, that software is (again) reliant on your computer being an OD master (and running xscertd). From what I can see, Apple is storing several pieces of data in the System Keychain (identity preferences for the OD CA and IA certs, the passphrase used to secure each private keys, as well as the certificates themselves) as well as in the LDAP database (CRL, CA certs). It appears that this utility is really only meant to read and write certificate and CRL data to/from the local LDAP node and System Keychain.\nThe downside to the OD setup is that it doesn't seem to be providing CRL distribution points inside of any of the certificates that are created by the Intermediate CA (i.e., the OD server's machine certificate; a code signing certificate for use with Profile Manager), which doesn't seem to be of much use.\nCranking it by hand\nOf course, this doesn't rule out using openssl on the command line to manage your certificates. Certificate management can also be somewhat automated using openssl configuration files. However, you will still be required to keep track of certificates that you have issued and those that have been revoked.\nYou can export your current CA's certs and keys out of Keychain Access, and (given it was created with the usage ability to sign CRLs) can use it for management of your certificate signing. Unfortunately, this will not give you the ability to use the user-friendly Certificate Assistant interface.\nAlthough it is also likely possible to mimic the setup that Apple is using (storing CA keys inside of the Keychain), when signing certificates with OpenSSL, the workarounds that would have to be performed in getting the keys out so that openssl can sign would be a bit of work, and may minimize the return.\n\nA: Did you try running the crl command from terminal ?

Is there a way to unlock the iPhone if it is no longer under contract?\n\nA: Unlocking is trivial with carrier support.\nHere is Apple's article on how to proceed technically once your carrier has unlocked the device:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5014\nWe have a nice thread on this Sprint to T-Mobile shift here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Getting an unlocked iPhone 4/4S to work on T-Mobile\n\nA: Assuming your account was in good standing while the phone was under contract with Sprint, you would have to call Sprint Customer Care to get it unlocked. See Sprint clarifies iPhone 4S unlocking policy on Macworld.\nSprint customer care representatives on its forums state that unlocking is done primarily for international use. Call Sprint World Wide on (888) 226-7212 to get it done.\nAlso see the following on the Sprint community forums:\nUnlock iPhone 4S\ni need my iphone 4s unlock\n\nA: In order to unlock - you will need to jailbreak it first. If you did want to jailbreak your iphone 4s as well,then jailbreak gives you to complete control to download whatever apps you want. That information is best for you that have an to unlock their iPhone. \n", "Q: Trapped: MacBook always shuts down during EFI SMC Update 1.8. Can't boot. How to remove updater from boot routine? MacBook Pro i7 Mid-2012 (MacBookPro9,2) running Mac OS X 10.8.5: Downloaded the \"offered\" EFI SMC Update 1.8 through the AppStore Updates. MacBook restarted, grey progress bar appears w/ spinning wheel, progress bar disappears at 20%, wheel spins a few more seconds, then display turns black and Mac shuts down.\nWhen I hit the power switch, same routine again: progress bar & spinning wheel until Mac shuts down w/ incomplete update. Tried SMC reset and Parameter RAM reset. Nothing helps. Can boot from recovery partition, but otherwise I'm suddenly trapped, which really sucks.\nDon't know what to do next. My idea would be to boot in Single User Mode (CMD-S at restart) and remove the SMC EFI Updater from the boot routine via command line. The question is: How?\n\nA: EFI firmware updates are 'staged' in the normally hidden EFI partition on your disk, which typically resides at device /dev/disk0s1.\nOnce in single-user mode, you can create a folder in which to mount this partition, then mount it like so:\nmkdir /Volumes/efi\nmount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi\n\nFrom here, navigate into the /EFI/APPLE/FIRMWARE/ sub-folder of the EFI partition.\nIf you find some files here, probably these are what your MacBook is trying to process and getting stuck on. You can safely delete them and reboot.\n", "Q: Terminal command to bring up shutdown dialog? I know how to shutdown a Mac from Terminal, but is there a way to actually bring up the shutdown dialog you get from Apple → Shut Down…?\n\nA: You can send loginwindow the kAEShowShutdownDialog Apple event:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"loginwindow\" to «event aevtrsdn»'\n\nThe four letter codes for Apple events are listed in AERegistry.h. See this answer for more information.\n\nA: This should work:\nApplescript:\n-- Open  Shut Down Dialog...\n-- Save this text as file named shutdown.scpt\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set uiScript to click menu bar item \"Apple\" of menu bar 1 of application process \"Finder\"\n    set uiScript to click menu item \"Shut Down…\" of menu 1 of menu bar item \"Apple\" of menu bar 1 of application process \"Finder\"\nend tell\n\nYou can run it from Terminal like:\nosascript shutdown.scpt\n\n\nA: You can create an Automator script that you can later run from the command line with \"open\".\nYou could \"Record\" in Automator. I guess that would be the easy way, but there might be other problems. Because when you record, Automator actually records mouse pointer movements…\n", "Q: I've taken a screenshot, how do I edit it? I'm used to taking screenshots in Windows and then editing them before posting them (with MSPaint)\nHow can I edit a simple image quickly on OSX?  \nI took a picture of a P.O. and I want to remove any PII information \n\nA: There is a default application named Preview in OS-X for editing images.\nIf you created any screen shots, just open that screenshot image in Preview application and you can see the edit toolbar to edit the image.\n\n\nA: Depending on your needs you could use one of these free tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's Preview (Built-in with OSX)\n\n*Gimp\n\n*Sketchbook Express\nIf you want something more advanced you could try\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe's Photoshop\n\n*Pixelmator\n\nA: I found another application named Skitch for Mac to edit the screenshot. There are many features like free hand circles (which is not available in the Preview app) are available in this application.\n\nA: If you have either an Android device or iOS and need a really comprehensive efficient image editor; export or save the screen shots (any image) into you iPhoto/google drive or Dropbox etc and then give Google SNAPSEED - (iOS Link)  a go!.\nI have used Adobe CS (Photoshop) etc professionally for years to edit compile images but I find this app really useful and nifty is the best for quick on the fly adjustments for work or fun and is extremely versatile - It doesn't give an Instagram/ready-made one click template feel to your pictures (unless you choose that vibe). If you want to use built in apps then iPhoto should be really fine for basic editing.\nWith GIMP — unless you have used packages like Adobe CS before — you will have lots of homework to do but it's fun free and does everything that Photoshop does in pretty much the same way or simpler once you work your way around it!\nSorry I don't have before and after for all or in order\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to specify artist artwork for Music in iOS 7? I've been a big fan of the redesign of the music app in iOS 7. I noticed that on the Artist list, certain musical acts have a thumbnail of band/artist next to them. This image is independent of any album art that I might have, and definitely comes from iTunes.\nI was wondering if there was a way to set this image manually. I have a lot of bands that aren't covered by this feature, and I think it's a cool way to visually identify the music  I listen to.\nIn the screencap below, The Moody Blues, The Mountain Goats and Neil Young all feature this custom artwork.\n\n\nA: I know this is extremely late but I was just wondering the same thing. In settings under music I unchecked \"group by album artist\" and well it worked, I'm assuming from that option. \n\nA: I think you should spell the artist name the same as what Apple's servers are using. In my case, I have a lots of songs by \"Linkin Park\" and still the artist image is the from cover of their album \"Hybrid Theory\". When I browse Apple Music their artist name is \"LINKIN PARK\" (all caps) so I renamed all my LP's songs, restarted the music app and connected to internet to download the image.\n\nA: after 45 minutes on the phone with Apple Advanced Technical Support, \"This feature is not available for manually uploaded songs at this time\". WTH!!\nSo this is not possible at present :(!\n\nA: Go to 'Artists' tab on your left under 'Recently Added'. \nRight click on the artist name you want, and instead of going to the artwork TAB, Double click on the microphone square in the upper corner. It will then let you upload any picture you want for your artist. \n\nA: You need a pc or mac running itunes.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can go to artists and select al the songs of the same artist (not\nthe album title) and then right click, this  will show another\npop up with a lot of tabs, if you click the illustrations tab you are\npresented with the artwork of your songs or a white square. Click the\nadd button beneath this box and again navigate to your artwork.\n\n\np.s. after doing this you still need to sync your ipod/iphone/ipad to make it show up on the devices :P\n\nA: The special artist pictures are synced in through iTunes when you connect to the internet next (since you synced the songs onto your iPhone/iPod/iPad). But based on the popularity of each artist, each artist has the choice to upload their image (if they choose to). But for example Sia, who never shows her face, has not uploaded an artist picture, even though she is popular enough. But if you want a better chance at the artist tab showing up, you need to make sure that you spell the artist name EXACTLY RIGHT!!! For example, I had (and still have) the rapper B.o.B on my music, but the artist picture didn't show up at first because I spelled it B.o.B. (with the extra period at the end). After I removed the extra period, it then synced in the special artist image from iTunes when I next connected to the internet over WiFi for my iPod Touch 5th gen.\nHope it helped :)\n", "Q: Why do I see this port as a leave? How to know if I really can get rid of it? Once I've installed an svn, I need it.\n$ port echo requested\n...\nsubversion                     @1.8.1_3\n\nAs I understand, this port is important for subversion:\n$ port echo depof:subversion\n...\ncurl-ca-bundle\n\nThen I take a look on what is important for it:\n$ port echo depof:curl-ca-bundle  \nperl5\n\nSo as a conclusion, svn needs perl5, right?\nBut:\n$ port echo leaves\n...\nperl5                          @5.12.4_0+perl5_12\n\nHow is that possible? Doesn't leaves: installed ports that are unrequested and have no dependents. mean I don't need perl5? So I need it for svn to work or not?\n\nA: Perl is a build dependency for curl-ca-bundle. Build dependencies are only needed at build time and can be removed afterwards, which makes perl5 a leaf in your case.\n", "Q: How to set a specific email address in Automator, from a variable? I can collect a variable (email address) from the clipboard. How do I set it to the recipient in Mail with Automator?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the New Mail Message action only uses variables in the Subject text field, so instead you would need to use something like another Run AppleScript action to create your new message.\nSomething like:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n\n\n          set theFile to item 1 of input\n\n          set theRecipient to item 2 of input\n\n\n\n          tell application \"Mail\"\n\n    set theMessage to make new outgoing message with properties {visible:true, subject:\"My Subject\"}\n\n    tell content of theMessage\n\n      make new attachment with properties {file name:theFile} at after last paragraph\n\n    end tell\n\n    tell theMessage\n\n      make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:theRecipient}\n\n    end tell\n\n          end tell\n\nend run\n\n", "Q: Running a local web server on MacBook I am using a MacBook with OS X Mounain Lion 10.8.3 and I want to install a local web server on my machine. What are my options? On windows I used XAMPP.\n\nA: If you just want something very quick, the OSXDaily article Create an Instant Web Server via Terminal Command Line explains how to do this on the command line using Python. Its pretty much just using the command:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\n\nA: If you are interested in running Apache, PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin, you can check out this article. \nOr just use MAMP\n\nA: Most of the stuff you need is already installed by default, or can be added easily. There is a lot of material on the web about how to do this, this article seems to cover the basics.\n\nA: As already mentioned, there is a simple XAMPP like solution called MAMP which comes as both a free and a paid version. The free version will suit most people. Just like XAMPP this will provide you with Apache, PHP and MySQL, and also PhpMyAdmin/\nIf you just want to serve a simple html page, with no underlying PHP or anything you could use Python's SimpleHTTPServer, with the following bash function that you can put in your ~/.bash_profile:\nfunction servedir {\n    local port=\"${1:-80}\"\n    open \"http://localhost:${port}/\"\n    sudo python -c $'import SimpleHTTPServer;\\nmap = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.extensions_map;\\nmap[\"\"] = \"text/plain\";\\nfor key, value in map.items():\\n\\tmap[key] = value + \";charset=UTF-8\";\\nSimpleHTTPServer.test();' \"$port\"\n}\n\nWith the servedir bash function, you simple change to the directory you want to serve, type servedir and then it will open your web browser at http://localhost so you can see your page.\n", "Q: Where is the Safari's History.plist file in iOS 7 I need my Safari history from the backed up file in iTunes.

I got all the screws from the back case off apart from one that sits in the corner on the end by the screen hinge.\nAfter trying with a variety of screwdrivers I cannot get the screw undone, and have now stripped the head of the screw. Any ideas how I can get this screw out?\n\nA: Whichever method you follow, be very, very careful. The worst case scenario may require drilling the screw out.\nTry placing a wide rubber band on the screw and use a slightly bigger screwdriver. Instead of a rubber band, you could also try with a piece of cloth (anything that can provide more grip and change its shape a bit).\nFor other methods, see The 12 Best Ways to Remove Stripped Screws.\nYou could also try iFixit's Precision Screw Extractor Set.\n\nA: This is what i ended up doing, after taking it to the apple store and them battling with it for an hour to no avail - i tried this approach listed on IFIXIT - which didnt work out entirely to plan, but still achieved a similar result. \nI bought off amazon this Dremel but the cutting disks where to large for the screw, after searching for fine metal cutting disks i decided that id just use the stock one that came with the Dremel, which i believe is for wood, but anyway.\nMy approach was to grind away the head of the screw which worked pretty well, what you've got be careful with is the heat this will make and also the vibration so do it in tiny 1 second bursts and let it cool each time, after about 10 or 20 little bursts i grinded away the screw head and most of the surrounding laptop case (i purchased a replacement online prior to doing this as i thought i might break it seeing that the screw was countersunk).\nEither way i did this and got the case off, replaced the RAM, screwed down the new bottom cover and booted up the machine. \nThe only downside in the long run is that there is now 1 screw which cant be removed, as it dosnt have a screw head, but its only 1 of 10 so i dont think its that a big deal.\nBe warned though this is a last resort, and not to be taken lightly, i really wouldn't recommend it to any one as the likeliness of breaking your machine is very high, i think i just got lucky. \nHeres a pic of the screw after being ground away, as you can see the head of the screw is no longer there and you can just lift off the case. \n\n"]
