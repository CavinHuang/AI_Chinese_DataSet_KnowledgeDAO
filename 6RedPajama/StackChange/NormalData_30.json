I can't get a cheap or free option to sync my 2 Macs easily. Thanks a lot! \n\nA: Even though I can tell, that this is a bad idea, here is my answer :\nIf you have a router in between, that should work, if not, you need to setup an Ad-Hoc network.\nSet-Up a ssh-keypair :\n\nssh-keygen -t rsa \n  ssh-copy-id 'user@otherMac'\n\nAnd write your rsync for each mac :\n\nrsync -e \"ssh\" -rc --delete ~/ user@otherMac\n\n(-e \"ssh\" = use ssh for transfer \n-r = recursive \n-c = compressed \n--delete = delete files that are not on the local device\n~/ = Home-Folder )\nU can, of course, adjust those.\nIf you don't have static IPs on the Macs, I guess you can call them by their DNS-Name, like \"Toms-MacBook.local\" or you can ping the DNS-Name and output the IP and give it to the rsync command.\nAnd the delete option is the problem.

In Diskutil, the SD Card isn't greyed out.\nAccording to this, I have to copy data from the Install ESD image to the SD Card to make it work.\nBut unfortunately, Terminal gives me this error. I also tried changing the file permissions with chmod en chown, which resulted in no change.\n\nA: I had a similar problem after installing Windows 10 IoT for raspberry pi on an sd card and it managed to make the card and file have no +w on directory/file. This was mistake number one as it turns out me managing to write this to a card on a Mac was never going to work on the pi. So the problem remained of how to reformat, as erase in disk utility would not work and no use of chmod would change the bits. Tried to change on an ubuntu box with the same problem \"Read-only file system\".\nThe only (hacky) way I managed to do reformat the card was to put it in a camera and reformat there - and bingo - done.\nI'm sure there is a legit way to do this (maybe on windoze but I don't have one of them), but the camera trick worked like a charm.

I would however like to upgrade to Mavericks for security reasons.\n\nA: Updating will not affect any partitions you do not choose in the set-up process. If you're not asked, then it will install on the partition the OS X install originated on.\n\nA: Normally there should not be a problem, if!\nAs always before doing the OS upgrade it is recommended to do a back up- just in case.\nThere are, however, a couple situations in which you might consider a clean install. \nThe first is if you’ve done some funky partitioning of your Mac’s startup drive that prevents the Mavericks installer from creating the special Recovery HD partition.\nThe installer creates an invisible, bootable, 650MB partition—a portion of a drive the operating system treats as a separate volume.\nMavericks will also \"updates\" the EFI partition.\nTo see all your current set up (including hidden partitions) use the \ndiskutil list in Terminal\n", "Q: Mavericks, Minecraft, Mods and Parental Controls My son loves Minecraft and I have set up an account for him to play and it works fine with Parental Controls enabled.   Now he wants to add Mods to the game and I'm having a hard time getting the system to allow me into the proper folders to allow me to add the files he needs.

I don't want to turn off parental controls if at all possible.   \nThanks. \n\nA: You'll have to open up Terminal.app for just a minute. This is what you should enter:\n\nsudo chmod 777 '/Users/sandbox0/Library/'\nsudo chmod 777 '/Users/sandbox0/Library/Application Support/'\nsudo chmod -R 777 '/Users/sandbox0/Library/Application Support/minecraft'\n\nObviously, you'll need to change out sandbox0 for your son's name, that was just the account I used to test it.\nSo what do these commands do?\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo means you'll be executing the command as root to ensure you have full permissions. You will need to enter your password the first time under a nice, big warning.\n\n*chmod means “change mode” which will change the permissions of the file, with the Library folder, the Application Support folder, and finally with everything in the minecraft folder. (the -R means recursive, going through all the files and folders inside that one).\n\n\nYou may have to run the final command once in a while as new versions of Minecraft are downloaded and ready to be modded; a new JAR that Minecraft downloaded on his account will not allow you to edit it.

These type of files being normally the largest and easiest to move. ( Do not delete any system files unless you know exactly what they are and removing them will not break you system)\nTry and give yourself at least 10-15% free space as a minimum and keep at or above that.\n\nA: kernel_task is doing that when it is paging out contents of RAM to disk. \nBased on your virtual memory usage (8GB+  also written to your disk) you are going to want to keep at least 12GB of space free on your startup disk.\nOS X uses virtual memory when it runs out of RAM, which means it moves some stuff from RAM to your disk and that is what is filling up the last bit of space.\n", "Q: iPhone, mistakenly fooled with VPN on to off.

Furthermore, I have to move a finger to the Ctrl key to cycle between tabs on OS X.\nIs there a recommended way to reconcile these differences so that I can preferably cycle between tabs with Cmd+Tab without ruining other key combinations?\n\nA: The best I've found is to go into Parallels Preferences and add the key-binds I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd-Shift-R Full Refresh\n\n*Cmd-R Simple Refresh\n\n*Cmd-Shift-I Open Dev Tools\n\n*Cmd-O While Dev Tools are open, search for a file\n\n\nMaybe others will have additional shortcuts that they use.\n", "Q: Restrictions pin change I have inherited an iphone as my work phone, the user previously set the restrictions PIN number and I have no idea what it could be and therefore cannot change and delete his apps\nAny body got any ideas.\n\nA: You can restore your device to remove the restrictions passcode. This will delete the contents of the device, but you can restore a backup afterwards.\nConnect the device to iTunes, choose your device and click Restore. This will erase and restore your device. Once this process is complete, you can set up the device as a new device or choose to restore from an iTunes or iCloud backup.\n", "Q: Is repeatedly reading a drive harmful? I have an external hard drive that was making an odd sound, and I wanted it to stop. I found out that navigating the contents of the HD in the Finder would make it stop temporarily. I set up a shell geeklet that ran ls /Volumes/ExtraStorage and that fixed the problem.\nMy question is if this can harm the hard drive if I use it over an extended period of time.\n\nA: This is likely a hard drive power management and sleep issue rather than an issue with the drive. When unused for a few minutes, the drive goes to sleep, possibly making a noise while parking the heads for safety. Your script accessing it in shorter intervals prevents it from going to sleep. You can confirm if this is the issue by observing how long it takes to access something on the drive after it makes the sound (and goes to sleep). If it seems slower than usual, it's because of waking up from sleep.\nFirstly, you should confirm if OS X is making the drive sleep and/or if the drive's firmware is the culprit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable your script.\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver and see if Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible is enabled. If it is, disable it and observe the behavior of the drive.\n\n*If the OS X configuration doesn't help, check the drive's make and model and see how you can disable sleep from the manufacturer's support site.\n\n\nOn one hand, disabling the sleep behavior would increase the amount of power consumed (even if it seems insignificant). On the other hand, if you would be using the drive somewhat often while leaving it connected permanently, it may be a good idea to just having it running and avoid the lag of a sleep/wake cycle.\n\nA: If your script fixes the odd sound and you have good back-ups, your solution is unlikely to cause worse problems.\nThat the drive is making an odd sound anyway suggests a problem. Make sure your back-ups are current and maintained.\nHard disk drives can be kept spinning and in use constantly. Your ls script run every six minutes is not placing a huge burden on the drive. It may be that OS X, or the disk  itself, will cache the repeated read and thus ls will not be triggering physical activity each time.\nAs for harm or reliability, the articles by Backblaze are reassuring. What Hard Drive Should I Buy implies consumer drives are surprisingly reliable even when used aggressively.\n", "Q: open image full screen with \"open -a Preview\" Using osx 10.9.3\nI would like to write a script that opens images full-screen with preview but I can't seem to find the command line options for the Preview application.\n\nA: Preview.app doesn't have command line options, but you could use AppleScript in Terminal:\nopen -a Preview somefile.png ; /usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Preview\"' -e \"activate\" -e 'tell application \"System Events\"' -e 'keystroke \"f\" using {control down, command down}' -e \"end tell\" -e \"end tell\"\n\nJust replace somefile.png with the path/image you want; AppleScript invokes fullscreen.\n", "Q: How to get iPhone to forget old Mac? My 17″ Macbook Pro died last November. I have a new Macbook running 10.9.3 but my iPhone 4 won't sync wirelessly because it's still looking for the old Mac. I cant find a place to make it forget the old one and sync via wifi with my new one?\n\nA: You need to sync your iPhone with your new Mac using USB. After you've done so, there is a check box to sync using WiFi in the iPhone's tab in iTunes.\nBe careful though, if you sync with your new Mac, and you haven't transferred your media to your new Mac from your old Mac, you will lose the media on your iPhone.\n", "Q: Strange thing happening with drag and drop on finder I have a Mac OS X 10.7.5. Sometimes, when drag-and-drop-ing files on the Finder, a strange thing happens, i.e. the file I'm dealing with \"sticks to the cursor\" and releasing the trackpad button has no effect, whereas it should let the file be transferred or copied. Btw I've been dealing with this many times, and for a long time, and have just found out today that tapping the trackpad with two fingers eliminates this strange thing, therefore placing the dragged file in the directory the cursor is on, or copying it there if I'm holding the option key. Any idea why this happens?\n\nA: It sound like a macOS bug. If the side effects are still present, try restarting Finder service by the following commands:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.Finder\nlaunchctl start com.apple.Finder\n\n", "Q: Can you update an iPhone 4 on iOS 6.1.2 to 7.0.6 using an IPSW file? So I have an iPhone 4 that's been happily jailbroken on iOS 6.1.2 for a while now, but I want to upgrade to 7.0.6. I downloaded the IPSW for it and shift-clicked on update, but I get the error 'The iPhone could not be restored. An unknown error occurred (3194)'. I read up on it and proceeded to correct my hosts and firewalls, but nothing seems to work.\nSo, the question is: Is what I'm trying to do even possible, or should I just settle for iOS 7.1 with no jailbreak? Also, is there any way to update without using iTunes, because it seems to be the only thing causing the problem?\n\nA: iOS 7.0.6 is no longer being code signed by Apple. Only the most recent version of iOS is code signed by Apple, and the iPhone will not accept a version of iOS that has not been code signed. So essentially, this is impossible.\n\nA: Apple is no longer signing iOS 7.0.6, so new installations of that firmware are not allowed anymore. That's why you're experiencing the 319x error.\nSolutions\n\n\n*\n\n*Stay on 6.1.x. This is what I would advise - iOS 7.0.x is terribly laggy on the iPhone 4, and iOS 6 is by far the best firmware for iPhone 4 handsets.\n\n*Upgrade to 7.1. iOS 7.1 drastically improves performance, especially on the iPhone 4 and 4s. It is better than 7.0.x, in all ways. You can indeed jailbreak the iPhone 4 on 7.1, using a tool named Pangu. You can also use GeekSn0w for a tethered jailbreak.\n\n*Wait for a 'signing fluke'. Sometimes, Apple randomly starts signing older firmwares for no apparent reasons. I call them 'signing flukes'. For instance, in July 2013, Apple randomly started signing 6.0.x when 6.1.3 was the latest available firmware, allowing users who had updated to 6.1.3 to jailbreak their handsets. If you are especially patient, you could wait for something like this to happen again, but don't hold your breath - they are very rare! You can keep tabs on Apple's signing statuses from icj.me.\n\n\nOne more thing...\n\nI downloaded the IPSW for it and shift-clicked on update\n\nMany people in the jailbreak community advise that you do not use update functionality of any kind on jailbroken devices, as anything could happen. Mainly, if you do this, the jailbreak data will clog up your phone, and there will be a large amount of wasted space on your phone, forcing you to restore. So, to save time, restore your phone instead of updating it!\nIf you want to preserve your data, you can back your phone up to iCloud/iTunes and then restore from the backup after restoring your phone. This also leaves traces from your jailbreak, but 'good' traces (like, for instance, if you used TetherMe to enable tethering, it stays enabled when you restore from a backup!)\n", "Q: Manually force sync on AppleRAID 1 I'd like to force a sync or repair on my AppleRAID set as part of a regular maintence.

I installed Macs Fan Control and I like to make both fans in my mac work at top RPM available all the time. The sound does not annoy me at all and I really like that the computer runs cooler.\nWill this hurt the computer in any way? \n\nA: Depends on what you mean exactly.\nIt will most likely mean that the fan itself will have a shorter lifetime before it fails. How much shorter is very hard to say - it might not mean much in practice.\nThe rest of the computer will definitely not be hurt by the fan running faster than usually.\n", "Q: When logging in, screen flashes then kicks back to login screen - Cannot login even in Safe mode I know this is similar to another post here but it went unanswered.\nPrevious Thread\nI have a Late 2010 13\" Macbook Air with Mavericks installed since launch.\nI was trying to use an external monitor which was giving me fits.

However, booting your Mac from your server requires a moderate internet connection as well as a quick bandwidth (at the place where the server is and your location) in order to work well.\nThe server offers a service called NetInstall that will allow you to boot from the server. More information how to active it can be obtained in the server documents in Update client software -> Provide NetInstall service).\n\nA: If you don't want to use DropBox another option could be ChronoSync.

An otherwise great app I'm using, annoys me as every time I start it, it writes to 2 files in the root of my user account which are clearly visible. Now, I have used the terminal command sudo chflags hidden with the name of the files to hide them, which does work, but nonetheless, when I launch the app again, it makes those once hidden files visible again! \nThe files content stays the same, so either its being re-written, or its being made visible again once the app is finished with them after boot, and whatever way it saves, the 'hidden' status of the files is being ignored or changed due to write permissions used by the app (I'm guessing).\nIs there any way to ensure that this app can find these files and do whatever writes and saves it has to, but I can still keep them invisible in Finder? As in keep the files hidden to my view but readable and writable to the app? Is a combo chown / chmod command needed alongside a Finder preference setting?\n\nA: Set an immutable flag on file(s) to prevent changes*:\nsudo chflags hidden,uchg /path/to/file\n\nWhat's an immutable flag? \n\n\"Immutable flags, also known as immutable bits, are file system attributes that, when enabled, prohibit changes to files or folders (objects), i.e. lock them. Enabled, immutable flags supersede permissions: you cannot modify an object whose immutable flags have been enabled despite having Read & Write permissions on that object.\"\n\nNote*: This will ensure that the file remains hidden, but may prevent the application from running properly if RW access is needed. This is the tradeoff. That being said, to unset the flag, you would run:\nsudo chflags nouchg /path/to/file\n\nIf this is the case, I advise that you contact the developer of the application since it need not automatically make a hidden file visible in order to be able to RW to that file. That's a bug in the application itself, period. \n\nA: Try giving it 0 write access with:\nsudo chmod 444 FILE_NAME\n\nThat will prevent the file from being written to. After you've done that, use the sudo chflags hidden command to hide them.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have multiple filevault2-activated partitions on one disk?

However, if you still want to clear the caches yourself, there are apps on the App Store that offer this functionality. 'Battery Doctor' (free) is one example - it offers many maintenance tools, including the option to delete 'junk data' from your phone\n\nA: Apps are compressed when you download them. When you have downloaded them, they are uncompressed on your phone.\nTherefore you'll see that the App Store states a smaller size, which is the size you have to download - and the phone states a different, larger size, which is the space it takes up on the disk inside the phone.\nSee for example:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa_(file_extension)\nIt states clearly that apps are delivered as .ipa files from the App Store, and that such a file is compressed (zipped).\n", "Q: Media keys behaving like function keys I'm experiencing some frustrating keyboard issues on my new 2014 Macbook Air (OS X 10.9.3)\nWhen using the laptop keyboard, the F1–12 keys take the behavior of \"function\" as opposed to the \"media key\" behavior they should have by default (brightness, volume, etc).\nI've unchecked the \"Use all F1-F12 keys as standard function keys\" setting in System Preferences.

I recently got a new Macbook Pro 15 retina. I already have a keyboard cover on it, and earlier today I put a palmrest and trackpad cover on it as well.\nHowever, This Apple support website says that applying palmrests and keyboard covers might actually be harmful to the screen and display. On the other hand, interestingly though, this Apple sales website  itself lists Moshi Palmrest as one of its supported Mac accessories.\nI'm thinking applying the palmrest will not do any damage as such? Please help!\nThank You.\n\nA: Any palmrest has a chance that it will be in contact with the screen, when the laptop's lid is closed.\nHaving anything in contact with the screen raises the risk that the screen may become damaged - at least on the surface of the screen.\n\nA: If you read the small print\nImportant: Information about products not manufactured by Apple is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute Apple’s recommendation or endorsement. Please contact the vendor for additional information.\n\nA: Did you notice the rubber seal on the bezel around the screen of the MBP lid? It looks from your link that the Moshi palm rest has a constant thickness and covers also the area which is contacted by this seal when the lid closes, so the relative distance between screen and palm rest area is maintained.\n\nI guess Apple's warning is for palm rests which are higher in the middle and will touch the screen when the lid is closed. And to make the lawyers happy who want to avoid users with scratched or cracked screens suing.\n\nAs for the sensibility of using special palm rests - this should be a question of its own.\n", "Q: How can I trigger my iPhone's alarm on receipt of an SMS message?

It's very jarring and bad for editing a bunch of files in succession. It also occurs if you click outside of the edit box, so it's not specific to pressing enter.\nI realize that I can avoid this by bringing up the Info pane for each song and then clicking \"next\"/\"previous\" instead, but this is a hassle and it would be great if iTunes did not move the library after editing.\nDoes anyone know of a fix/hack for this problem? I don't remember it happening in the past, though I don't edit lots of song titles all that often, so it's possible I just never noticed.\n\nA: Right click on the iTunes Coulomb headers.\nThat brigs up the long list of choices.\nUn-check the Date Modified and Added.\nClick on Name coulomb and sort alphabetically.\nNow after editing it should stay put.\n", "Q: Disable Finder icon preview blurring When I click on a finder icon to view it's preview, the icon is crystal clear like in this photo,\n\nBut when I scroll through all the files with the arrow keys after I click, they become blurred like this: \n\nIs there any way to disable this or is there an app the stops this?\n\nA: I think I've finally found the reason why it's been doing this. Every time you click the item it generates a preview the very moment you click down on the item. During the period that your mouse is clicked down, it runs its image anti-aliasing algorithms to create the preview.\nI've noticed when I click on the item as fast as I can (ensure that I release the click as fast as possible), I get a better probability of the image being aliased rather than smoothed. Being a programmer, I think it's definitely because the computer can't generate the smoothed preview fast enough if a fast click is used. So to always get aliased images, I'd think a macro is probably the only way to click fast enough without having to rely on the speed of your finger every time you click.\n(usually you can set the execution time of the macro, this is the only thing I can think of to solve the problem)\n", "Q: iTunes versions installed When I click on iTunes update it shows there is a new version available.\n\nHowever when I click on get it, it comes up with no updates available but shows 2 of the same versions downloaded? 11.2.1 !\n\nHow do I go about fixing that?\non MBA 10.9.3\n\nA: Solved problem #1.\nI forgot that I did \"Hide Updates\" on iTunes (silly me).\nBy reactivating, it did show the bundle and allows me to update to 11.2.2 among all other updates in that bundle.\nThat still does not solve the part of having a duplicate update version showing foor 11.2.1.\n", "Q: Can the thief erase and clear my iPhone before \"Find My iPhone\" has a chance to detect its location? I have lost my iPhone5 and had a sick feeling that the phone has been erased and cleared before Find my IPhone has even had the chance to detect it. Is this possible? \n\nA: Yes. Sadly, a thief might steal 10 phones and discard the ones that are locked hoping that some are not protected with Find My Friends like yours was.\nThe phone can only report location if it has a viable network connection, so it is entirely possible it was taken to (or placed in) an area with no cell coverage and no WiFi coverage and/or simply turned off.\nHowever, if the thief or anyone else does erase the phone, the iOS 7 activation lock will eventually report back to you since the device will need a viable network connection to become active again once it's been erased so you might keep that device in your iCloud list even for 6 months or longer in case the thief is patient and hopes to resell it at some point down the road.\n\nA: Be patient and keep trying, it might show up after they turn it on.\nBut keep reading what else could have happened.\nRecovery Failed: What Now?\n\nSo now your iPhone’s been missing for a while, and you haven’t been\n  able to track it down. The thief may have turned the phone off, erased\n  it or removed the SIM card. Or the thief is in another country, and\n  you’re getting no help from the authorities (and don’t want to get it\n  yourself). At this point tracking is unfortunately no longer an\n  option, and many people give up. Do not despair, for there is yet\n  hope!\nIf, for some reason, you didn’t set a SIM PIN, the first thing you’ll want to do is inform your phone provider/carrier to disable\n  your SIM and potentially save you many dollars of calls.\nNext, file a police report and give them your device’s serial number and IMEI (phone only). Thieves occasionally get nabbed with a\n  whole bunch of stolen stuff, this way they’ll be able to return your\n  device to you.\n      You may want to consider wiping your device to ensure that your personal data does not fall into the wrong hands. You can remotely\n  wipe your device from within Find My iPhone, but note that once your\n  device is wiped, you will no longer be able to track it.\n      If you’re a corporate user and your iPhone/iPad is configured to sync with Exchange, you can also remotely wipe your device through\n  your Outlook Web Access (OWA). Simply log in, click Options in the top\n  right, then Mobile Devices in the left-hand menu, and finally select\n  the device you want to wipe and click Wipe All Data from Device.\nThe final step, to be taken when you’re pretty sure your phone will\n  never return, is to disable it so that it will be useless to anyone\n  else. In some countries can give your carrier your phone’s IMEI, and\n  they can blacklist it, essentially rendering the phone useless (nice\n  paperweight though). \n  At that point if you do manage to get your phone\n  back, however, you won’t be able to use it as it’s not possible to\n  remove a device from the IMEI blacklist (to my knowledge).

Help Please!\n\nA: Try holding down the Control key when you press the power button.\nHere's a note from Apple about the new behavior:\nOS X Mavericks: Using the power button\nAnd here's a good discussion:\nCan I restore pre-Mavericks power key behavior?\n", "Q: Are OS X installs specific to a machine type? When OS X is installed, does the installer:\n\n\n*\n\n*write only generic files (that will work on any machine supported by that OS), or \n\n*customise the installation to a specific machine type in any way?  (If so, presumably this is based on the machine that the installer is running on?)\nIn the past, I have assumed that the answer is \"OS X installs are generic\", and used various tricks based on that assumption.  But I've only ever done this in various temporary workarounds, because I don't really trust that assumption.\nIf I had a trustworthy (so preferably referenced) answer \"OS X installs are generic\", here are some examples of what I could do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Mac Pro using the software on a MacBook Pro (ie laptop is in target disk mode, connected to desktop via FireWire, I hold down alt when booting the desktop and choose the laptop drive).\n\n*Run an installer on one machine, writing to a hard drive that I intend to install in a different machine.\n\n*Create an installation in a virtual machine (via VirtualBox etc), then write it to a standard volume for use in a physical machine, or vice-versa.\n\n*etc\nTo try and limit the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Considering Intel only: let's ignore older PPC hardware\n\n*Let's say this is about 10.8 onwards\n\n*Apple hardware only: I'm not asking about Hackintosh\n\n*I understand that some applications may be confused in various ways by a change in the underlying hardware environment, but I'm just wondering about the OS itself here.\n\nA: Yes and no.\nIn regards to retail installation discs / upgrades \"purchased\" from the Mac App Store, no, they are typically not machine specific.  These are general builds that are meant to install on any supported hardware.\nMachine specific builds DO exist although at this point of time they aren't an issue for most people.  When Macs shipped with physical restore media (multiple CDs/DVDs) that media was very specific to that particular generation/model of Mac.  What this meant was that you could have an early 2008 MacBook and an early 2008 MacBook Pro, the MacBook media would display an error when booting the MacBook Pro and vice versa.\nIn regards to the actual installed files, yes, these days the installations are pretty generic.  I don't want to say that the installed files on a MacBook Pro Retina are the exact same as those on a MacBook Air, but for the most part this will be true.  In the past (early/mid PowerPC days) there were some differences but even then you could usually use one Mac to boot another.  The main problem we used to run into was remotely installing Tiger or Leopard using a mix of Intel and PowerPC Macs.  In those situations it was best to use PowerPC to PowerPC or Intel to Intel.\nThe only time this may not hold true is if you're trying to boot a newer Mac using the disk of an older Mac that has an older (older than the system the newer Mac shipped with) system installed.  For instance, if a new iMac was released tomorrow and I tried to boot it using 10.9.1 installed on my MacBook Pro Retina there's a good chance that it wouldn't boot because the iMac requires 10.9.3 or above.\n\nA: The simplest thing you can do is run the same installer on 2 different hardware (on a blank HDD) then compare the exact size of those installations. If the sizes are the same, then it's a generic install, if not, it's a specific one :)\nYou can ever make a diff ( diff -rq dirA dirB ) between the directories to see what change between the 2 installs\n\nA: Generally, the files installed are generic to all Macs that the OS supports.\nThere are two caveats:\n\n*\n\n*New Macs launched after the current OS release may be given a special build of the OS that adds drivers for new hardware. Those drivers will be rolled into the next release of the OS.\n\n*Macs with the T2 chip complicate things a bit. If you've turned off Secure Boot, it is possible to boot from an external drive with a generic OS installation; but cloning the internal disk from another Mac doesn't work, and you have to install the OS again. However, what it is exactly that gets changed is unknown, and may be some configuration rather than different hardware drivers.\n\n\nA: macOS installers are indeed specific to the Mac that they are downloaded onto, even when using softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version. This was not always the case, as I have clear memories of downloading earlier versions of OS X/macOS on say a MacBook Pro and using the installer successfully on an iMac, Mac Mini, etc.\nMore info and a workaround from munki's installinstallmacos.py script:\n\nSince it is using Apple's installer, any install check or volume check\nscripts are run. This means that you can only use this tool to create\na diskimage containing the versions of macOS that will run on the\nexact machine you are running the script on.\nFor example, to create a diskimage containing the version 10.13.6 that\nruns on 2018 MacBook Pros, you must run this script on a 2018 MacBook\nPro, and choose the proper version.\n...\nUse a compatible Mac or select a different build compatible with your\ncurrent hardware and try again. You may also have success running the\nscript in a VM; the InstallationCheck script in versions of the macOS\ninstaller to date skips the checks (and returns success) when run on a\nVM.\n\n", "Q: Upload iPhone HD videos to YouTube Modern iPhones capture full hi-def videos with 1920x1080 resolution. When I download the MOV file to my computer and then upload it to YouTube, it only shows as 360p resolution.\nHow do you upload iPhone videos to YouTube keeping their HD resolution?\n\nA: hmm... turns out YouTube shows HD options for the video only some time after the video is uploaded. My guess would be that YouTube continues processing the video in the background and exposes the various resolutions only when they are done processing.\nSo the answer is: just upload your HD videos, it'll retain the resolution after a while\n", "Q: How to diagnose Finder losing icons for folders?

I had this happen a long while back, and it was pretty simple to fix. I deleted one file:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nThen rebooted and the problem was solved. I think what happens is something can cause the Finder preferences to get corrupted, so deleting the .plist will force a new file to be created upon the next reboot.\n", "Q: Deleting all copies of a photo If I delete a photo from both Camera Roll and Photo Stream, is there still another copy on my Mac or elsewhere that Photo Stream placed there?\n\nA: It depends on the order of sequence.\nWhen a photo enters Photo Stream, all devices that are on and running and set to download a copy can get the photo. In the case of your Mac, iPhoto can be set to automatically import the photo, so yes - it could have a copy stored in the library even though you have deleted it from the stream.\nDeleting the photo from the camera roll doesn't have any influence on the stream or other devices other than perhaps if you were to connect the device over USB to a computer and import later, but I'm guessing that's not your concern.\nIn practice, there is some delay so if you took a photo on the phone and then deleted it almost as soon as you took it from Photo Stream, the delete likely would prevent another device from seeing the photo, but if your network is fast - the photo could be elsewhere.\n", "Q: How can I open a hidden file in Text Wrangler?

The deciding factor will be cost and if iMovie/Motion can do what I want.\n(I'll probably eventually get Final Cut but its going to be a while due to budget)\nIf I use Motion to create lower thirds, title sequences, and playing a bit with other special effects like particle systems and such... afterwards can I export them with a transparent / alpha background to import into iMovie?\nI read How useful is Motion 5 without Final Cut Pro X? but it doesn't really cover this. Says I would have to slice up the movie and do the Motion work on top of the exact segment I want it.\nUntil I can afford to upgrade to FCP would Motion and iMovie give me the tools I'm looking for?\n\nA: Yes, Motion can export with transparency into iMovie. I have used this exact procedure in the past and can confirm it works great. Using iMovie's picture in picture with some resizing retains the alpha and lets you overlay whatever you've exported from Motion into iMovie.\nThe linked question's answer is from 2011 and things have changed a lot since then, namely the introduction of the 'Advanced Tools' which include picture in picture (and have recently been abolished and integrated directly into the workflow). This means you don't have to 'splice' your video and work on it externally — it's all integrated pretty smoothly.\n", "Q: How do I move an app? I have several apps on my iPod touch (5th generation) that I would like to move from their current place on screen to a different place on screen. Is there any way to do this?

Is it possible on Mac as well? If yes, how?\n\nA: OS X doesn't have a global manager for volumes of specific apps unlike Windows. Rather, you can change the volume of apps inside the app themselves.\nFor example, iTunes has a volume slider inside the app that lets you change the volume of iTunes, and whilst I'm not familiar with  the options menu of CS:GO, I presume it has a slider for volume. Use these controls for changing the volume and script them if necessary using AppleScript or equivalent.\n\nA: I have found a solution or an answer to my own question, so I thought I'd share it with everyone else.\nEveryone who has the same problem or who wants to know how to do this, check out the application called SoundBunny. You have to pay for it but there is a demo version. It might be worth noting though that it doesn't seem to work with USB/Firewire audio interfaces currently.\nIt does exactly what you are able to do on Windows with the integrated sound regulation thing on the task bar. \n", "Q: Categorize E-mail on Iphone I use categories to classify the e-mail in my inbox (Microsoft Outlook 2010).  I have not been able to figure out how (and if it's even possible) to categorize e-mail from my iphone.  Has anyone accomplished this?\n\nA: (This answer assumes you are running iOS 7 or later, and that you mean Outlook.com mail.)\nYou are certainly able to categorise your mail in Outlook.com mail. However, if you set up your Outlook account before September 2013, this may be your issue.\nThe two most popular email standards are POP3 and IMAP4. IMAP4 is preferred because of push mail and the ability to categorise your email. POP3 lacks these features. Before September 2013, Microsoft did not implement IMAP4 capability in Outlook.com, forcing users to use the inferior POP3 standard.\nPossible Solutions\n1. Check that you know how to use mailboxes: From Mail, go into the root of the app. You should see all of your accounts listed. Tap [Outlook] if you do. If you don't (i.e. Outlook is your only account), you are already in the Outlook menu. Next, tap [Edit] and then [New Mailbox]. The rest is self explanatory. To move mail into mailboxes, open the message and tap the folder icon. Then, choose the mailbox that you want to move the mail into. Easy! If you still can't see the mailbox options...\n2. Delete and set up your Outlook.com account in Mail, Contacts, Calendars: You will not lose any content by doing this, as all data is stored in the cloud. Simply open Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars, and delete your Outlook account. Then, set it up again. This should force your iPhone to use the newer, IMAP4 capable settings. If you are still unable to create mailboxes...\n3. Set up IMAP4 settings manually: Using the settings available on this page, enter Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account > Other and set up the Outlook.com account manually.\n", "Q: Changing terminal colors for normal files when ls -G or within .bash_profile So I followed this thread (Changing terminal color) and got all of the colors working for directories and such, except however, for normal files such as a Gemfile or .txt files or .java files or .rb files etc... I was wondering how I can get normal files to show up in color, even better if I can get different extensions of the file to show up in different colors as well. Let me know if you guys have any resources for this.\n\nA: I don't think colorizing the file names of regular files is possible with ls alone (i.e. without postprocessing the output with another script):\n\n\n*\n\n*The manual page for ls (shown when you type man ls) does not mention this possibility.\n\n*I would expect that the ls coming with Mac OS X is very similar to the BSD version of ls, since there seems to be little motivation for Apple to make changes in this area.  The source code for BSD's ls is available online, e.g. the FreeBSD version is on GitHub.  The function which selects the color for a file name is colortype() in the source file bin/ls/print.c.  And checking the source code it is clear that at least the BSD version of ls does not have the ability to change color when printing the names of a regular file.\n", "Q: Moved iPhoto Library: Need to point iMovie in the right direction my friend has moved her iPhoto 08 Library from an external HD.

He put it for many things that he didn't even know about. For example, downloading and deleting apps and Safari. So now that I want to do different things on my phone, I can't because my dad forgot the password.\nIs there a way that I could take off the restrictions without deleting all of my things? If that isn't possible, then how can I restore my phone so the restrictions could come off? I heard that you can use find my iPhone someway so I could take off the restrictions but I'm not sure and I don't want to do the wrong thing.\n\nA: There's a tool that can recover the restrictions passcode from a device backup, called Pinfinder. Follow the macOS instructions and download the tool which is a command line binary and it will recover your pin.\n\nA: There's no way to do this without restoring the device. You won't break the hardware, but you will lose all your photos and music and apps and data from the apps - so be sure to connect to iTunes or save your photos and anything you can't lose to another place like a computer or a cloud service.\nQuoting this Apple KB article titled \"iOS: Understanding Restrictions (parental controls)\"\n\nIf you lose or forget your Restrictions passcode, you will need to perform a factory restore to remove it.\n  .\n  .\n  Last Modified: Mar 25, 2014\n\nThe find my iPhone restriction is that if your iCloud account has the device locked, you will need to enter your iCloud password before the restore starts. This password is different from the PIN code that was entered when the parental controls were set up the first time.\nIf you really can't afford to lose the apps - you could have your parent write down on a piece of paper the pin codes they might choose now and then try entering them one by one to see if you can recall it. That is the best way to unlock, but you will soon run out of time to guess and entering / breaking that restriction by brute force isn't something that's viable.\n\nA: Just go  to Restrictions or Accessibility..idk..either way, get to Clear Browser Data and restrictions will be off.\n\nA: There is a file that you can edit to change the Restrictions Passcode to anything you want.  \nFirst read the instructions at the following URL to help you understand the issues and reset process.\nhttp://www.techbout.com/reset-restrictions-passcode-iphone-ipad-ipod-8365/\nDownload and install the following utility:  iBotBackup\nDo a complete backup using iTunes.

You can edit it in the XML editor, or copy and paste the text into TextEdit on the Mac and make the following changes.\n1) Find all keys that begin with the string \"SPParentalControl\".

I own a mid-2009 MBP with OS X Mavericks installed. I'm a hi-tech enthusiast who wants to use the fingerprint scanning feature made available by many scanners on the market to login into my account after boot and unlock the screen after the screensaver has started.\nThe scanner I'm willing to buy is a DigitalPersona U.are.U-5160 which is not only FIPS 201 PIV certified, but it's also designed to work in harsh environments and situations. See: http://www.fulcrumbiometrics.com/Digital-Persona-U-are-U-5160-p/101106.htm\nPlease note that I've already read this article on StackExchange (How can I enable fingerprint authentication on a Mac? What compatible scanners are available?) which talks about the same, but I've found nothing interesting in it.\nIn particularly, supposed that I've gotten all the Smart Card Services/CAC Libraries:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I switch from password login to fingerprint login?\n\n*Can I use fingerprint login with FileVault 2 too? (i.e. decrypting the HD using my fingerprint, with no passwords to type)\n\n\nI think these features require dedicated API's or SDK's, and Apple stopped deploying them since it bought AuthenTec. Now, all fingerprint-scanning feature are officially unsupported by Apple except for the iPhone 5S.\nI've read somewhere that LastPass does a very similar job indeed, and is used for the purposes I've listed.\nHow can I achieve this?\n\nA: I don't think you can do what you're trying to do.  Firstly, the Digital Persona fingerprint scanner you mentioned is compatible only with Windows, Linux and Android - not Mac OS X. And secondly, it is important to remember that when you boot up with a Filevault 2 encrypted laptop, the OS is not loaded.  You have to provide your credentials - which causes FV2 to load the encryption key so the drive is readable.  Then the OS loads and logs you in.  \nSo any biometric authentication scheme that is Filevault 2 compatible would have to have software stored in EFI (BIOS) or one non-encrypted hidden partition - and I think that would require Apple to come up with a solution for that.\n\nA: I think this Mac OS Forge project might be your best bet – SmartCard Services.\nMy research leads me to believe Apple stopped putting 'official' efforts (documentation, etc.) after OS X 10.6.\n\nA: After Yosemite, I don't think this will be possible with FireVault2. It could potentially work as a secondary verification but not on startup. As I understand, kexts loading is a prerequisite to non-native peripheral drivers loading. \nSeems firmware passwords and FV2 would need to be disabled at least, and since Yosemite requires kext-signing as default unless it's disabled by eg. Trim Enabler. This has other issues associated. If you took this course (assuming it's possible with peripheral compatibility), it'd likely only work if login was disabled or as secondary verification. \n\nA: As of 2021, there is now an official Apple solution. External Touch ID requires 2 components:\n\n*\n\n*Apple cpu (M1) based Mac.\n\n*Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. The one that was originally available only as a bundle with 2021 iMac 24\".\n\nUnfortunately, there is none for Intel-based Macs.\n\nA: To achieve something like this would take a lot of research but i am sure you can, you can install third party software that performs this and have the fingerprint reader as a second method of logging into the computer. I just googled it and there are fingerprint readers that work with mac the only trouble i think you may have is finding a third party software to run the scanner. \nhope this helps.\n\nA: I expect that any mac compatible fingerprint scanner will come with the necessary software and it should install automatically  when you plug in the device or pop up and say you need to install the associated software. This would enable login by fingerprint and keychain unlocking by fingerprint and disk decryption by fingerprint as it replaces your password for these situations.\nTo make sure your chosen device supports Mac OSX I would suggest you call them up or email them and ask about their Mac support and what software is included with the device.\n\nA: If you have an iPhone 5S that is jailbroken (or an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus that you intend to jailbreak) then UnlockID is an option. UnlockID uses Bluetooth to connect to your Mac, and then allows your Mac to access the fingerprint scanner on your iPhone. Have a look at this Cydia link - http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.barn.unlockid/\n\nA: Now with OSX 10.13.3 High sierra, on a new macbook pro, I was prompted to set up fingerprint access. The help docs say: \n\nIf your Mac has a Touch Bar, use Touch ID preferences to enable your\n  Mac to be unlocked with your fingerprint, add one or more fingerprints\n  to your user account, and enable Touch ID to be used to make purchases\n  with Apple Pay and from the iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks Store.\n  To open this pane, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click\n  Touch ID.\n\nTo temporarily disable it, one just clicks in the area where the password prompt would be, and it becomes visible. \n\nA: Since Apple opened up its Local Authentication Framework (using Touch/Face ID)  on iOS devices it is now possible to obtain an app for a [non-jailbroken] iPhone/iPad that can be used to unlock your Mac using a fingerprint/face (or a knock). e.g. Unlox/MacID, Knock, Fingerkey.\n\nA: I use a very useful tool, DriodID to unlock my Macbook Pro 2017 using my android.\n", "Q: Is there a way to see the amp levels while charging my iPhone? I'm told that different amp levels charge iDevices in different times. Sometimes I plug into my laptop, sometimes into a car converter, and other times into the side of a flatscreen TV for charge. Is there a way to see on the iPhone (or iPad) what the amp level coming out of the USB port are? Perhaps an app?\n\nA: I don't believe so. \nThe available API for battery state in iOS gives you only 5% resolution. It might be possible to write an app that polls battery state and calculates a rate of charge based on the time between 5% intervals but I don't know of any apps that do this. If you want to get your app on the app store that's about the best way of measuring it directly. I know of an app that captures the screen and looks at the battery charge image to determine charge an alternative way but that's iffy, the size or appearance of the battery indicator might change between versions and then it breaks.\nJailbroken devices are a whole other can of worms. I know how to get 1% resolution on devices with a private API but you can't get such an app on the store so distribution is going to be limited.\nBTW your terminology is a bit confusing. \"Current\" would be the right term, less commonly \"amperage\". I had to read a couple of times through to work it out, I thought you were talking about music volume at first.\n\nA: I cannot speak for official apps, but I know that for jailbroken iDevices, there is a console/Terminal command that can be run called powerlog that provides live feedback about power usage, (dis)charging levels, amperage/current, capacity, etc. It's a very powerful tool, and if you already have a jailbroken device and are comfortable with using command-line tools (a big if, I suppose :P), then it is definitely an option to consider.\n\nA: Here's a hardware solution that's currently on Kickstarter: Legion Meter\nBlurb from their Kickstarter page:\n\nLegion Meter is a device that can safely accelerate your\n  smartphone/tablet's charging speed up to 92%. It also features a\n  built-in multimeter for displaying voltage, current, power, and\n  milliwatt hours on the integrated OLED display.

Could you please verify that by issuing the following command in a terminal and check if you get a similar output to the one in the picture:\ndiskutil corestorage list\n\n\nThe currently available Disk Utility doesn't support resizing of logical Volumes.  However using the command line, there is a undocumented function that allows you to resize Volumes. \nIf you consult the help command of diskutil you will receive the following output:\nchris$ diskutil corestorage\n\nUsage:  diskutil [quiet] coreStorage|CS <verb> <options>,\n    where <verb> is as follows:\n\n list                     (Show status of CoreStorage volumes)\n info[rmation]            (Get CoreStorage information by UUID or disk)\n convert                  (Convert a volume into a CoreStorage volume)\n revert                   (Revert a CoreStorage volume to its native type)\n create                   (Create a new CoreStorage logical volume group)\n delete                   (Delete a CoreStorage logical volume group)\n createVolume             (Create a new CoreStorage logical volume)\n deleteVolume             (Delete a volume from a logical volume group)\n encryptVolume            (Encrypt a CoreStorage logical volume)\n decryptVolume            (Decrypt a CoreStorage logical volume)\n unlockVolume             (Attach/mount a locked CoreStorage logical volume)\n changeVolumePassphrase   (Change a CoreStorage logical volume's passphrase)\n\nAs you can see, it doesn't offer any option of resizing a Volume, hence my guess why Disk Utility doesn't allow you to resize.\nHowever the following undocumented functions exists:\n    chris$ diskutil corestorage resizeVolume\n\nUsage:  diskutil coreStorage resizeVolume\n        lvUUID|MountPoint|DiskIdentifier|DeviceNode size\nResize a logical volume, which is one of one or more disks that consume storage\nout of a logical volume group.

The pixel density is so high, your eyes can’t discern individual pixels. Images take on a new level of realism.

Unfortunately, movies on iTunes rarely have subtitles in any language besides English - but there are many fan-made subtitles files out there, and if this was a normal movie file it would be a simple matter to use them.\nI'm guessing this is one of those questions where the answer is just \"no\", but is there any way to take a subtitles file downloaded from the internet, and use it while viewing a movie rented via iTunes?\n\nA: iTunes Videos are DRM-Protected and are not saved entirely on the local Drive AFAIK.\nTherefore it is very hard to kind of \"inject\" a subtitle file.\nI think Apple made this restriction due to quality reasons. They want a product to be very clean and complete as they can officially provide it.\nSome Movies don't provide the Info officially and some other movies simply are'nt worth it..\nSo no,there is no official way. I guess you can only give Feedback to Apple, describing your problem and hoping to fix this in the future.\nBUT\n: There's always an App for that !\n", "Q: Apple Maps Licence for use in app Do Apple Maps have any limitations or any licence fees, if I use them in an app that I develop?\nFor eg: google maps are free for 2500 uses per day in applications:\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/licensing\nIs there any such Information on Apple Maps or are they just free for iPad and iPhone apps?\n\nA: As far as I know, there are no license fees - nor limitations such as the \"fleet management\" exception with the old Google Maps based API.\nYou need to check your individual license terms with Apple.

Is there a way to temporarily pause the syncing of photos over iCloud on an iOS device? Sometimes I'm on a 3G connection and don't want to waste my quota syncing photos or sometimes I want to speed up the download of other files by pausing iCloud. Is it possible?\n\nA: There is no way to pause it, but you can disable it temporarily. The only downside is that you will have to redownload all the pictures when it is re-enabled. To disable cell data for photo stream, you can go into Settings>Cellular and find the Photos app. Simply turn it off.\n\nA: I had a slightly different situation...my wifi is shared with macbook air (laptop), 2 iPhones and an iPad.  I upgraded my storage plan with iCloud and a lot of syncing was going on so I couldn't do much else online.  This article helps pause iCloud syncing on a mac.  I then put the phones and tablet into airplane mode.  That freed up the wifi so I could at least work on my laptop.

If I bought Lion Server from Mac App Store, am I eligible to upgrade to Mountain Lion Server for free? Or if I'm based on Mountain Lion Server, can I upgrade to Mavericks Server?\n\nA: OS X Server doesn't follow the same pricing structure as the recent operating systems.  While 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and 10.9 (Mavericks) have both been free their respective server apps have still had a cost associated with them.\nThe only change from Lion Server to Mountain Lion Server and Mavericks Server was a reduction in price from $49.99 to $19.99.\n10.10, Yosemite, has been announced and is following the same free pricing scheme as it's two predecessors but I haven't seen pricing for it's Server app yet.  Personally I'd be surprised to see Yosemite Server cost less than $19.99.\nWith all of that said.  Apple is typically pretty good about honoring recent purchases when a price reduction or new version is released.  For instance, if you purchased Mavericks Server today for $19.99 and then see that it's been dropped to $9.99 or free next week then Apple will often issue a credit for the difference if you inquire.\n", "Q: Applescript to fill in Keychain dialog box I'd like to fill in the Keychain Dialog box with the Name: and Password fields (printer is windows print queue), but after the Print command, the Keychain dialog box opens up, but never responds to anything till I click OK or cancel. \n  tell application \"TextEdit\"\n  activate\n  make new document\n\n  print document 1 with properties {target printer:\"2nd-floor\"}\n\n  tell application \"System Events\"\n\n         set value of text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 to \"CUA\\name\"\n\n         click button 2 of window 1 of application process \"SecurityAgent\"\n\n  end tell\n  end tell\n\nHope I missing something silly, thanks.\n\nA: Consider altering the requirement for a password.

If you get connected (using a password for example) the real mac-address will be shown to the router.\nIt's just a randomize function for unknown networks.\n\nA: I'm not up-to-date with how it works exactly. But I've heard that the MAC address is only randomized when it's looking for all available WiFi networks. When an user selects a network to connect with, your non-randomized standard MAC address is used. I think this wouldn't be any problem.\n", "Q: Creating the same, double applications for iOS permitted? To get more exposure in the App Store for iOS apps I found out that creating a second application for 'top keywords' is vital for getting more downloads. I am considering creating 4 or 5 iOS applications that are identical to each other (in code) with a completely different design on a top search keyword. \nTo give an example, let's say I've created an iPhone game with the name \"Pokemon Center\". To get more exposure on the popular search term \"Pokemon game\" I simply create 4 other games with exactly the same content in a very different design. \"Pokemon Center for Kids\", \"Pokemon Center Fast Play\", \"Pokemon Center Red\" etc.\nAn better example: \"2048 original\", \"2048 lite\", \"2048 for Kids\", \"2048 for Adults\"\nSo far, it worked as I have 2 identical applications in the App Store. And I'm getting more downloads & revenue. My games (or game) is actually getting really positive reviews from players.\nIs this permitted?\n\nA: Apple can reject apps which are duplicates:\n\n2.11\n  Apps that duplicate Apps already in the App Store may be rejected, particularly if there are many of them, such as fart, burp, flashlight, and Kama Sutra Apps\n\nSource: Apple App Store Review Guidelines\nYou should only create one app and spend your efforts promoting this app. Furthermore, if you seek to make apps that appeal to users with clear functionality, Apple's interests and your interests will align. In the case where you are looking to ride hot search terms, unless your apps are really what you are seeding in the search terms - trying to work the system shouldn't work in the long run.\n\nA: Apple will revoke apps in the AppStore containing the same information and code. You have to make individual projects with more differences or change the design after login for example.\nPlease check this wiki\n", "Q: How can I get my AppleScript code to move files? Having used Automator to organise files by file extension successfully before, I decided to create an AppleScript application that will save me having to change parameters manually, as Automator doesn't allow me to set a variable for the \"Filter Finder Items\" action.\nHowever, for some reason or another, my AppleScript code decides not to actually move .wad files. I've tested it with .jpg files and it works perfectly. I've tested it with .epub files, same thing. But it doesn't seem to be able to detect .wad files.\nBelow is my code. It creates the folder in the correct location with the name I put in the first dialog box, but it doesn't move .wad files into the new location. I end up just creating a blank folder. The Result AppleScript gives me when the script terminates is {}\ndisplay dialog \"Set folder name\" default answer \"\"\nset foldername to (text returned of result)\n\ndisplay dialog \"Set file type\" default answer \"\"\nset filetype to (text returned of result)\n\nset newfolder to ((path to downloads folder as text) & foldername as text)\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n\n    if not (exists folder ((path to downloads folder as text) & foldername as text)) then\n        make new folder at (path to downloads folder) with properties {name:foldername}\n    end if\n\n    move (every file of folder (choose folder) whose name extension is filetype) to folder newfolder\n\nend tell\n\n\nA: It appears the following line is returning an empty list:\nevery file of folder (choose folder) whose name extension is filetype\n\nAs an experiment, try a different suffix matching approach:\nevery file of folder (choose folder) whose name ends with \".wad\"\n\nIn the Finder, make sure the .wad files are in fact showing their complete name. Do this with Get Info on one wad file in the Finder. It is unlikely but possible that the true file suffix is being hidden and thus not being matched.\n", "Q: Wikis on OS X Server - How do I include or embed content from one wiki page on another? How do I include or embed content from one wiki page on another in Wiki Server on OS X Server?\nThe other wiki page resides on the same server.\nThis is known as an \"include\", Redmine has it:\nInclude a wiki page.

I switched to an OpenSource Ruby on Rails app called WAGN http://wagn.org\nIt does this exact thing and much more.\n\nA: This is currently not possible in OS X Server wikis. To include content from other pages, that content must be copy-pasted into the desired location—you can't reference text from other pages.\n\nA: When you edit a page you see an arrow in tools bar that permit you to insert link (external or internal).\nFor the internal link don't copy/paste url, cause it'll doesn't work if you migrate your wiki to another server.\nJust use wiki tools.\n\nA: Not sure if anyone else will run into this issue since this is an old post, but I was able to find out how to link to another page within a Mac server wiki.

Using AirPlay I stream those to my AppleTV.\nThe quality is pretty awesome.\nYou don't mention where you live, but maybe there is an app available in your region too?\n\nA: Depending on the cable provider and location, if you are a \"member of household\" which has a cable subscription to ESPN you should be able to use the ESPN app to watch the World Cup.\nAs an example: If you are a college student and your parents have Comcast cable subscription to ESPN.  Have your \"parents\" set up an Comcast email account / login for you. You should be able to use that email/login & password to verify the cable account.  Then you should be able to access ESPN app content when you are away from home.   \n", "Q: can't add contacts keyboard is missing I have an iphone 4.

On the new Mac, it says I only have 157 KB of data on the old one, even though I have a lot more than that. I tried transferring it anyway and it just restarted right away while the old one said it was trying to reconnect with the new one. I don't see any of my files on the new one.\nI tried booting with Command + R and reinstalling the OS on the new Mac but that didn't seem to do anything.\nHere is what I see on the new Mac:\n\nWhat can I do to properly transfer my files?\n\nA: I recently experienced this issue as well. I hypothesize that the backup is being staged in a cached folder while it completes at which time it'll write the dirs into the proper file structure. To reclaim the diskspace, simply quit migration assistant. Login as a user and restart your Mac. By doing this it cleared out the cached migration and i could start again.\n", "Q: Why can't I paste Chinese characters to Word? I have a strange problem with Word, every time I paste Chinese characters into Word, it looks like this:\n\nHowever, I have no problem pasting Chinese characters to Pages(both 09 and 13 versions are OK), what should I do?\n\nA: You might need to install some fonts in order to make Word able to display those characters. This is a common problem with Asian languages - for example it is almost impossible to get Excel to show Thai fonts, although if you install Thai fonts on the system, Word will use them.\nYou also did not specify which version of MS Office you are running - older versions were even worse than recent versions.\n", "Q: How to stop multiple iDevices from sharing iCloud-sync'ed information? Wife just got a iPad mini, we already have an iPad and an iPhone. Now all 3 are linked together -- they share Contacts, Notes, Reminders, etc.  We want to unlink all of them.  \nI know there has got to be an easy way but just can't figure it out.\nDo we need all different AppleIDs or different accounts? And if so how we do that and then assign/change the different devices to the different IDs?\n\nA: I believe the best way to accommodate lush you goal is by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete account from Settings > iCloud \n\n*When asked to keep on iPad or delete, choose whether you would like that same information saved but be able to edit it without it affecting other device's information.\n\n*Choose set up a free Apple ID and proceed through the setup\n\n\nThe pros of this scenario:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having the other devices using the new Apple ID to receive their own free 5 GB of iCloud storage \n\n*You will still be able to use the other Apple ID for iTunes and App Stores\n\n*Edit the content from the old iCloud account without those iCloud devices being affected from the changes\n\n*Utilize the iPhone cellular calls with iPad and other features of iCloud which are functionally made to be segregated between people\n\n\nThe cons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another email / password combination to remember.\n\n\nOther information: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can still share photos between accounts using iCloud photo sharing\n\n*Check the Apple ID used in Settings > Messages and Settings > FaceTime to ensure the proper Apple ID is being used, otherwise all devices could be sharing text messages and phone calls.\n\n*Additionally, you can setup Family Sharing in order to keep using apps, music and other media already payed for, and paying for future purchases with the same credit card.\n\n\nA: Go to Settings > iCloud\nIf you want to completely unlink them, and create a new iCloud account for each, scroll to the bottom and choose Delete Account - be very sure that this is what you want to do though!\nIf you just want to stop syncing between devices, just change the sliders on the page and turn off the things you don't want synced.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: If you want to stop something like contacts or safari etc, just go to:\nSettings --> iCloud \nAnd you can pick anything to turn off. This means, you don't have to create multiple accounts. You may have to do this on both devices, but this does work. Hope this helps! Also the options are fairly limited, so some of the features you are looking for may not be there.\n", "Q: Is there a canonical guide to replacing the hard drive in a MacBook Pro? I have a mid-2010 Macbook Pro 7,1 that I have kept up to date over the years, currently running the latest version of Mavericks.\nI am planning to replace the 250 GB Toshiba hard drive it came with. The new hard drive will be larger capacity. When I did these kinds of upgrades with my Windows machines, I would just boot from a Linux USB drive, and use dd to clone my partition images. This way, I never had to deal with re-installing anything.\nThis will be the first time I upgrade a hard drive on the Mac. Is there a list of recommended procedures, so that I can attach the new hard drive via a USB enclosure, clone the existing set up, install the new drive in the bay, and just boot up?\nI would like to avoid installing Mavericks from scratch, restoring from backup etc.\n\nA: Here, courtesy of iFixit, is your step by step guide to replacing your HDD, photos included at each step.  \nAlso, see this ASC user tip if you plan to upgrade with a SSD/need advice on how to go about backing up the data on the existing drive before replacing it. \n\nA: The answer turns out to be surprisingly simple and, yet, hard to ascertain beforehand.\nInitially, I thought I would have to reserve space for the boot and rescue partitions, and then use the one partition layout in the Disk Utility to clone my existing hard drive.\nMy question was specifically about the partitioning, and not the physical aspect, or backups. I wrote about my experience on my blog.\nIt turns out, when you clone using the single partition layout, the two additional partitions are also automatically created and copied. This is not mentioned any page/document I read before attempting the installation.\nIf you create multiple partitions, clone your existing hard drive to the first one (assuming it is a suitable size), and it looks like you'll automatically get the boot and rescue partitions as well.\nDefinitely useful for the ignorant, but rather confusing for the experienced ;-)\n\nA: The iFixit guide is a great visual explanation of the physical procedure. My replacement process was a bit more complicated because my husband's hard drive had failed.\nJust a thought:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Time Machine backup on the old hard drive\n\n*Create a Bootable USB (How do i install OS X on new hard drive? I have macbook pro mid 2010.) \n\n*Install OSX on the new hard drive using the bootable recovery\n\n*Use a SATA/IDE to USB connector to connect your old hard drive, and then use Time Machine in the Mac Recovery Utilities to navigate to the time machine file on the old hard drive and restore from there\n\n", "Q: OS X - How to disable the opening file animation? Does anyone know of a way to disable this animation:\n\nI recall being able to in previous iterations of OS X.\n\nA: You can disable all animation in Finder with:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations -bool true && killall -HUP Finder\n\nI don't recall a preference just for this animation though.\n", "Q: Smart Playlist song count incorrect on music app I have a smart playlist that has 804 songs. \n\nThe smart playlist also has the same song count when viewing the device via iTunes\n\nHowever, the music app displays 6 less songs. \n\nWhy would this be happening? I've deleted and re-created the playlist, but that did not work. I'm not sure what else to do.\n\nA: The most like answer for that is that not all songs may have been transferd to your device maybe do to unsupported format or maybe you have duplicates in your itunes library.\n\nA: Interesting. I edited the playlist to include the criteria \"Playlist is Music\", and the count is now the same. Got this idea from https://discussions.apple.com/message/22808976#22808976. \nIt also solved the sorting issue I (and many other people, it seems) was experiencing.\n", "Q: Having trouble with a SMC reset I'm having trouble with my built in iSight and I'm trying to reset the SMC. My MBP has a non-removable SMC, so the instructions ask me to press CMD-SHIFT-ALT-POWER at the same time, release it at the same time and then press the power button to power on the machine.\nTrouble is that, the machine power ons when I press CMD-SHIFT-ALT-POWER and I dont think that resets the SMC. What should I be doing to correct this?\n\nA: That is the incorrect key combination. You are pressing Command instead of Control.\nTo reset the SMC on portables with a builtin battery, press (left side):\nShiftControlOption + Power Button\nSubsequently, release them at the same time. Then power on your computer. \n", "Q: So Apple A7 is “System on chip or” or “CPU”? Very confused, in some websites, they have this line:\n\niPhone 5s\n\nCPU: Apple A7\n\nother websites saying that:\n\niPhone 5s\nSystem-on-chip: Apple 7\nCPU: 1.3 GHz 64bit dual core\n\nother sources saying that\n\niPhone 5s\nSystem-on-chip: Apple 7\nCPU: 1.3 GHz 64bit dual core Apple 7\n\nin Wiki, it said:\n\nThe Apple A7 is a 64-bit system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc.\n  It first appeared in the iPhone 5S, which was introduced on September\n  10, 2013. Apple states that it is up to twice as fast and has up to\n  twice the graphics power compared to its predecessor, the Apple\n  A6. While not the first 64-bit ARM CPU, it is the first to\n  ship in a consumer smartphone or tablet computer.\n\nThere are 2 sentences:\nThe Apple A7 is a 64-bit system on a chip (SoC)\n\n& \n  While not the first 64-bit ARM CPU\n\nWiki also said The A7 features an Apple-designed 64-bit 1.3–1.4 GHz ARMv8-A dual-core CPU, called Cyclone\nSo System on chip is also CPU? very confused\nThen other source compares System on chip and CPU, they said \"CPU will not work without other around components\" & \"System on chip is the combination of CPU & other components into a single chip.\"\n\nA: A SOC contains more elements than just the CPU (graphics capabilities, sound, IO controllers etc), but the CPU is by far the largest, most complex component within it.  A SOC can be referred to as the CPU, because that's where it is (the rest of the contents  of a SOC are more variable, but there has to be a CPU), but obviously not all CPU can be classified as a SOC.\n\nA: The A7 as the A4, A5 and the A6 are Systems on a chip. \nOn the chip there is the CPU (an ARMv8), the GPU (a Power VR), the IO controllers and the RAM. \n", "Q: Outlook 2011 - how to disable auto correction? How can I turn off the Auto Correct feature in Outlook 2011?\nI was not able to find anything about that in the web.\nEdit: \n\n\n*\n\n*Disabling all Auto Correcting in the Preferences as Buscar웃 suggested did not help.\n\n\nA: The Auto Correct (spelling) is located in the Outlook Preferences.\nOpen the AutoCorrect and uncheck all.\nJust in case we are talking about something else:\nTo turn off automatic spell checking, on the Edit menu, point to Spelling and Grammar, and then clear the check mark next to Check Spelling While Typing.\n\nA: Changing settings within Outlook didn't help. It appears that Apple has an overriding spell check, and when it's on, Outlook still automatically corrects words not in its dictionary, making them into embarassing spelling mistakes. \nIn my version of the Mac OS (10.9.4), the master switch is in:\n   - system preferences\n     - keyboard\n       -text\nOther versions of the Mac OS (Lion?) apparently have it in:\n   - system preferences\n      - Language & text\n        - text\nThanks to answers.microsoft.com for pointing me in the right direction.\n\nA: There are 2 places:\n\n\n*\n\n*Outlook > Preferences > Autocorrect: uncheck Replace text as you type\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Text: uncheck Correct spelling automatically\n", "Q: The iTunes Connect review process for submitted apps is not simple and linear I have two apps in queue for review by Apple.\nI had uploaded two app recently.\nApp 1 >> New App uploaded on 5-Jun-14\n\nApp 2 >> Update for app uploaded on 4-Jun-14 (one day before of App 1)\n\nStatus I see is \nApp 1 >> In review\n\nApp 2 >> Waiting for review\n\nI just don't understand, how can the app that I uploaded later is in review first? I've asked twice for expedited reviews and they were denied. This is something frustrating me.\nDoes any one know how app approval process goes?\nI wanted the update to get approved asap.\n\nA: Maybe apple prioritises new apps over updates.\nIf your update contains major bug fixes you can request to get it expedited.\nYou can checkout recent review times here: http://appreviewtimes.com\n\nA: The web site AppReviewTimes collates information about recent app review times. Reviews are currently taking about one week.\nLong waits for reviews are not uncommon.

I am using chrome on Macbook.\n\nA: There is no such function in iCloud, but you can install this here in chrome and use it: Chrome Webstore Link, I have used it for iCloud before and it just works perfect.\n", "Q: Can't install Mountain Lion on a machine that has Mavericks installed, even on a separate disk/partition I have upgraded my Mac mini 2012 to Mavericks, and everything is running quite well.  However, it turns out that I need to also run Mountain Lion sometimes (a piece of hardware I need to use is not Mavericks compatible.)\nI am attempting to install Mountain Lion on a 2nd partition on my Mini's internal hard drive by following the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*used Disk Utility to repartition my mini's internal drive, creating a 100 GB partition to install Mountain Lion on\n\n*used DiskMakerX to create a Mountain Lion bootable USB key\n\n*rebooted machine while holding down Option\nAt this point the boot menu appears and I see icons for both my Mavericks partition, as well as the Mountain Lion installer USB key.  However when I select the USB key and try to boot from it, it does not boot; instead I get a gray screen with the universal \"no\" symbol (circle with a slash through it) on it.\nI tested the USB key on another Mac and it booted fine, so there is nothing wrong with the USB key I made.  So it would seem that the Mountain Lion installer will refuse to run on a computer if it has a newer OS on it, even if the computer has a free partition (or drive) to install on to.\nIs there any way around this restriction?\n\nA: The only thing you can do is install ML on an external drive on another mac running 10.8.x then copy the partition using SuperDuper on your 10.9 mac\nLet's say your mac is A, 10.8 mac is B and usb HDD is C :\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Mac Os 10.8 on C using B computer\n\n*Create a partition on A (with ± 50GB)\n\n*Duplicate C on the A new partition using SuperDuper\nAnd voilà !\n", "Q: MacBook Hangs on Boot at seemingly different stages each time Our Macbook hangs on startup and doesn't boot into the desktop environment.  The most notable problem is that the Macbook doesn't make the usual startup sound when we boot up.  It doesn't make any sounds at all at startup.  Then it hangs for a long time on the grey screen with the Apple symbol and the spinner.  \nWe have tried to restart it several times, and most of the times it does what I wrote above, but on a couple occasions it actually showed the desktop background, but then froze.  One time it showed the blue screen and then froze.  \nI have tried to boot into Safe Mode (holding shift) and it won't boot into safe mode either.  I tried booting into Safe Mode with verbose enabled, and the few times I did it, I didn't see any errors, but it stopped once after this line:\nAirPort: RSN handshake complete on en1\n\nThe other 2 times it stopped after a few lines later:\nNTFS volume name , version 3.1\n\nAfter seeing these lines on the verbose output it just stops.\nThe one thing I CAN do is boot into command line mode (holding command+s), and I can navigate through the file system via command line.  I performed fsck -f and it said there weren't any problems with the hard disk.\nThat is about all I know, any help would be greatly appreciated.  Is there any way I can recover this computer?\nThanks  \n\nA: Your problem seems to be bit deeper since you tried few options already.\nYou might or might not have the recovery installed! \nYou could get one and use it from USB, or if it happens so you might have bootable os on USB.\nIn none of the above is possible then try using the Target disk mode.\nFor that you will need a second mac (not many have that).\nTo some degree the Apple Hardware test could detect problems with hardware.\nPress and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n", "Q: Suspend some mail notification correponding to a sender I wish to disable some mail notifications let's say, the ones coming from a mailing list named TEST.

That resolved the problem for me.\n\nA: You can't select which system services have access to 3G from that page. Many system services' data use can't be switched off—only the services themselves.\n\nA: Settings>iCloud>iCloudDrive>Use mobile data. Turn it off. All other cellular datas you need to turn off are already mentioned in the other answers.\n\nA: I agree with user185442. This seems to be impossible. I spent a long time disabling data traffic for all non vital apps and services, including things like Music, iBooks, App Store and a large number of 3rd party apps. I still got 912 MB \"System Services\" usage in an afternoon. The culprit (apart from Apple's programmers) seems to be iTunes purchases, that probably somehow were downloaded over 3G, even though Mobile Data was disabled for iTunes & App Stores.\n\nA: *\n\n*Turn off the Cellular Data for the apps which are not important.  \n\n*Make sure the backup on cloud is not via celluar   \n\n*Go To \"Reset\" and click on \"Reset Network Settings\".   \n\n*After Resetting \"General\" option will not appear in your System Services.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine Could not complete the backup I am getting this error:\n\nThe backup disk image \"Volumes/Data-1/studio@iphotographic.sparsebundle\" could not be accessed (error (null)).<\n\n\nA: I've had this issue before and when it occurred, the system logs of the affected Mac seemed to indicate that there were filesystem journal errors on the Time Machine drive.\nMy Time Machine drive is mounted remotely via an Airport Extreme to simulate a Time Capsule, and it is used by several Macs. All the other Macs were still backing up fine, so rather than connecting the drive directly to a Mac and doing a Disk Utility diagnosis and repair, I just mounted the Time Capsule drive from another Mac, deleted the backup sparse bundle from it and then removed the disk from the Time Machine preferences on the affected Mac.\nI then added the drive back again and it all worked.\n\nA: The most obvious thing to do when Time Machine can't find a back up destination is to open the system preferences and turn off that destination. Optionally shut down the Mac, and then add the correct location. \n\nA: When I encountered this error today (backup destination located on a NAS) the error seemed to be a temporary folder in the destination named MyComputerName.temp\nAfter removing that folder Time Machine started working for me.\n\nA: It appears the Time Capsule gives several different errors. One was null, the other was error 109. Both of these errors stated that the time capsule could not be accessed.\nResolution:\nThe problem seems to be that the software has trouble with dealing with a lot of characters. OR People with multiple computers are hitting the backup at the same time and overloading it.\nSo fix both.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove time capsule from all computers\n\n*Go to all of your computers and go into I believe it is System Preferences -> Sharing (Sorry I'm a PC guy) and rename EACH of your computers to unique names that are 8 characters or less and no symbols. If you feel the need to. Try 11 characters for the name of one computer. But do not push 11 characters.\nThe reason why we are doing this is because of this:\nThe backup disk image \"Volumes/Data-1/studio@iphotographic.sparsebundle\" could not be accessed (error (null)).<\nIf you look at the above in the portion that I have marked with the ** you will see this is the name of the person's computer. Firmware on devices do not work the same way as computers. Being that the name of the person's computer is over 11 characters AND has a symbol in it - this is a probably reason for the failure.\n\n\n*Go into Airport utility, erase the time capsule disk, rename it to something that is 8 characters or less as well (because the point is to get this backup to work - we are eliminating all other avenues)\n\n*Go into the time capsule software. Connect your first computer.\nDO NOT CONNECT ANY OTHER COMPUTERS\nIf your backup is successful. Go to the next computer, enter the time capsule software, and connect it to the time capsule and start your backup.\nRepeat this process until all computers have been backed up.\nShould the above fail, look up hardware failure symptoms. For my client this process worked for him after I set it all up.\n", "Q: How do I remove a preference (save password) set in the iCloud keychain? Months ago I was on a website and after logging in, Safari prompted 'Do you want to save this information to your iCloud keychain' or something. If I'd said yes, the next time I'd went to that site, my login information would already be filled in.\nHowever, for a single site, I (think I)'ve set it to 'Don't remember login information' and I can't get that to change to 'remember login information'; At least, I do not know where to correct that setting.\nSo simply: How do I adjust a preference of 'Do not remember' to 'remember' or at least that preference?\nThanks!\n\nA: The setting is in Safari, not Keychain.\nOpen Safari > Preferences... > Passwords. You will see a list of sites that is searchable. Under \"Password\" you will find some that say \"never saved\", select that item and click the Remove button. \nBasically Safari keeps track of the sites that will have remembered credentials, but they are securely stored in Keychain.\n", "Q: Who is the kid on Preview app icon? \n\n\n*\n\n*Who's this kid? \n\n\nbtw, I am also sure that, he's now not that much innocent, he grew up.\nIts also noticeable that with release of Yosemite, the Preview app icon get changed.\n\nA: Apple often uses employee's photos for things like this.\nWhen filling iPhoto with content for on stage demos and later demos in their stores Apple will often request photos from their employees, through an open submission contest.  Obviously not every photo gets used but more often than not the family photos you're seeing are shared from an employee somewhere within Apple.  I've tried to find some of the old articles that outlined this process but they've either been buried away or removed at the request of Apple.\nKnowing that, my best guess is this was a son, nephew, grandson, etc of an Apple employee around the time that Apple was looking to change the Preview icon.\nHardly a definite answer (we still don't know who he is) but it might be the closest we get.\n\nA: Using google image search, the only result is this twitter account but it doesn't seems to be him.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro retina, hardware repair - advice A pair of weeks ago I spilled coffee on my MacBook Pro Retina 15'' (MacBookPro10,2, Early 2013), and now I just received the quote from the customer support centre.\nIt's a 3rd party authorized reseller and service provider (listed on Apple's website).\nTheir evaluation:\n\nSpillage is visible on Logic board\n  no light on magsafe adapter\n  Certain keys not working on Topcase\n  Full Diagnostics unable to be completed due to issue.\nNew logic board needed (661-7386)\nNew Topcase needed (661-7454)\nNew Magsafe board needed (923-0096) \n\nThey are going to replace these components:\n\n\n*\n\n*661-7386 PCBA,MLB,2.7G,16GHZ-HYN,VRAM,KEPLER (£ 380.00)  \n\n*B661-7454 BATTERY OOW, TOP CASE, 15 (£ 150.00)  \n\n*923-0096 PCBA,MAGSAFE 2 (£ 30.00)\n\n\nThey explained to me that in order to replace the keyboard they also need to replace the whole top block, which also comprises the battery, the speakers and the trackpad.\nAlso, the processor (Intel Core), the 2 graphics cards (integrated and discrete) and the memory (RAM) are all soldered to the logic board, so they have to replace them all.\nBasically, the only components not being replaced will be the SSD, the display and the fans.\nI have got a couple of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*is their list of components to be replaced correct? Is it true that replacing the logic board also means replacing all the rest?\n\n*What's the normal Apple policy for this kind of replacements? Do they have to use new components, or can they use refurbished ones? (I'd rather to get new parts)\n\n\nA: Their evaluation & explanation sounds legitimate.  I would assume that when the coffee was spilled it made it's way into the keyboard.  If this is the case it's entirely reasonable to assume that it would make it's way through the keys and inside the top case, with the next component it reaches being the logic board.\nIn regards to your two questions:\n1) Without seeing the Mac and only relying on my experience (see below) I can only make an assumption, but from the information given the list of parts does seem very likely.  Yes, the logic board contains a majority of components for your Mac.  The processor, GPU, SMC, some ports, etc are all located on this one major component.  With the way I'm assuming the spill occurred the coffee wouldn't have made it to the SSD, which connects directly to the logic board, thanks to the SSD being located on the opposite side of the logic board.  The only fault I see with their explanation is the speakers, I haven't replaced a Retina top case in a while but I could've sworn that the speakers are still separate components.\n2) There's no way for them to tell you upfront if the parts are new or refurbished.  Apple re-uses eligible (meaning not beyond economical repair) parts after a strict refurbishing process that includes individual testing of components.  When technicians receive parts there is no distinguishing feature to know if it's used or newly manufactured.  Honestly, the only way to be sure is if you request a part for a Mac that was just released, simply because there wouldn't have been time to collect used parts and put them through the refurbishing cycle.  Either way in my experience I've never seen a trend of service (repair) parts being faulty.  It DOES happen from time to time but I've never seen a trend of obviously refurbished parts leading to repeat repairs or premature failures.  Apple's replacement parts do carry a 90 day warranty or take over the rest of your existing AppleCare warranty, whichever is a longer period.\nDid the AASP mention a flat rate or depot repair to you?  I haven't priced out the parts they mentioned in a while b considering the amount of damage that might be a little bit cheaper.  Basically Apple offers tiered flat rate repairs for out of warranty situations.  Since this is liquid damage it would likely be a tier 4, the highest of them, but it might still be a little cheaper.  Might be something to ask them about.\nSource - I worked as a Genius for several years, as an in-store and onsite AppleCare certified technician for several years and have dealt with AppleCare extensively on both sides (as a technician and as a representative for an enterprise customer) for several years.  I've repaired well over 1000 MacBooks, around 1000 iMacs, several hundred MacBook Pros/Airs and a couple hundred Mac minis and Mac Pros.  Everything from in warranty failures to severe fire and liquid damage.\n\nA: Your first question can not be answered without physical access to the hardware.\nYour second question about parts:\nIf for some reason Apple service uses refurbished components! they will inform you.\nIf refurbished is used it is\na) apple certified\nb) comes with Apple standard warranty.\n", "Q: Re-order reminder accounts in OS X In the sidebar of the Reminders app for OS X, you can see your accounts and then the lists of reminders in each account.\nHow can I change the order in which the accounts appear?

The order of the list of accounts can't be modified without deleting and re-adding the account.\n", "Q: Why does the message icon show only for one number In one of my contacts I have added two phone numbers. I want to know why the message icon that let's me text to this number show up only for one of the two numbers as well as how can I fix this. \n\nA: Just change the phone number label Work to mobile or iPhone. \nApple makes the assumption here that only mobile phones can get text messages which is sometimes wrong. \n", "Q: Does Apple have a policy restricting generic UUID with iBeacon apps in the app store? I heard that developers must specify clearly the list of iBeacon UUID their app is working with, and that each change in this list would require an update.\nThe reason would be to prevent companies to apply \"counter-marketing\" strategies, using their opponents' iBeacons to broadcast their own coupons. \nI'm developing a generic app that may let the user input his iBeacon's UUID or fetch them from a server. \nWould this application be really rejected by the appstore's validation process ?\n\nA: The answer is yes, Apple is rejecting the apps that let the user input iBeacon UUID. If you fetch an uuid from a server, that would probably result in the same problem.\nJust a quote from an article about this issue : \n\n\n\nWe’ve been receiving reports that Apple has recently taken its “lock down” of UUID scanning a step further. Before, you needed to specify the UUID numbers you were scanning for in your app, but you could also manually input those numbers.\nBut now, Apple is rejecting apps that have this functionality. Awwapps is one of the documented cases of this rejection:\n\"With the upcoming updates of our iBeacon apps Launch Here and Travel Radar we will remove the option to manually add and edit iBeacon credentials (UUIDs, Major ID, Minor ID). This is not our choice. We do this to keep the apps in the App Store. We’ll do our best to come up with other options to add your iBeacons – better options…We will improve on this and extend support to more iBeacon vendors…Please note that a general scanning of all iBeacons around is not possible on iOS. We rely on your input to cover all commonly used iBeacons.\"\n\n\n\nSource : http://beekn.net/2014/05/apple-closed-system-apple-slowly-locking-ibeacon/\nWhy :\nApple decided this for security reason. That allows developers to prevent their ibeacons of being used by others companies.\nWhy it's not a big deal :\nMost beacons constructors set up their beacons with the same UUID. So the most commons beacons may still be found, unless the UUID was changed for security reasons. For example, by default, the UUID for all the iBeacons built by Estimote is \"B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D\". You then rely on the \"major\" and \"minor\" id sent by the beacon to develop your application.\niBeacons aren't invisible :\nIt's possible on Android devices to develop an application able to see all the iBeacons in range, and to get it published on the Play Store without any trouble.\nOn iOS, it's still technically possible that an application may let the user input the UUID value, it just won't be approved by the App Store.\nAnd of course, the iBeacons still emits Bluetooth data that still physically exists in the air.\n", "Q: Removing email account prompts to remove from other computers So I added my @att.net email address a while back and decided to remove it from OS X Mavericks Mail. When I clicked to remove it, it prompted me if I wanted to delete this email account from iCloud on this computer or on all computers. It also gave me a list of all the computers associated to my iCloud account. However, a lot of those computers don't even exist. How can I edit this list of computers associated to my iCloud account?\n\nA: Go to iCloud Devices, sign in, click on \"all devices\", select the one to remove and click erase .\n", "Q: How to disable shortcut for an Automator script? A few weeks ago I wrote a short script with the Automator to get familiar with it.\nI found a website which explained how to set up a primitive script to start the screensaver and define a shortcut to start it. I chose cmd + L to activate the script and it worked fine.\nNow I want to disable the shortcut and delete the script. The problem is, that I forgot how and where I defined the shortcut. It is not listet in the system preference -> keyboard section. Unfortunately I can't find the website with the how to or an equivalent description. \nAny suggestions for my awkward situation?\n\nA: If you want to remove the shortcut and not the service go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts and make sure that in the right pane services is selected, I think that might have been your issue. The just un-click the check box next to your listed service.\nI've had an issue recently where services aren't showing up in the services pane, to fix this just copy the service to your desktop from ~/Library/Services and delete the service in the Library directory, then paste the service back in again.\n\nA: Using Automator to create a service will place the service in ~/Library/Services. You can delete the service from here. Deleting it will also delete assigned keyboard shortcuts.\n", "Q: How can I get my 13 inch MBP (A1425) to display 4k? I just got this monitor, http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-SE39UY04-39-Inch-Ultra-120Hz/dp/B00DOPGO2G\nWhen I  plug it into my MBP's HDMI port, the highest resolution I can choose on it under the \"scaled\" option is 1080p. Why is this? I've upgraded OSX to 10.9.3 but it has not helped me at all. Any ideas? I've also tried using a thunderbolt to hdmi adapter but that didn't work either.\n\nA: Straight from the Apple Spec Sheet for that model:\n\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on up to two external displays, at millions of colors\n\nLooks like that model does not support 4K displays\n\nA: Holding the Option key while clicking on Scaled should show you all the options for that display.\n", "Q: Broken login.keychain, what now? I recently moved computers, and since then I can no longer import certificates into my login keychain. I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tried using Keychain First aid\n\n*Tried running reset password in recovery mode to reset permissions\n\n*Tried running disk first aid and resetting permissions\n\n\nNone of these have helped. I still get [UNIX]Permission Denied when I try to import.\nSo I tried a few other experiments:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried deleting old passwords from the keychain. that worked fine\n\n*I made a new keychain, development, and imported the certificate there. that worked fine too.\n\n\nSo for whatever reason, something is wrong with my login keychain. Is there a way to export everything and re-import into a new copy? I looked on the Apple web site, but it's hopelessly out of date.\n\nA: I hope this helps someone in the future:\nThe list of keychains, notably login.keychain, is stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist\nThe system.keychain and similar are found in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist\nIf those files have wonky permissions, you'll have problems doing anything. Even if the keychain files themselves are fine, if the OS is unable to edit those two files it just silently fails in weird ways. Notably, Keychain Access will keep forgetting about the whole login chain, and anything you add or remove from it.\nThis same problem may apply to the keychain itself; if you can't save to it, you likely have wonky permissions.\nNote that it appears Disk Utility does not fix this, although I don't know why. It seems you have to manually fix this. You can do this by doing a Get Info on a root folder and reapplying permissions. In my case the problem was that the Owner was wrong because I moved the files from another machine.\n\nA: Create a new login keychain and copy the contents of the old keychain into the new.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Keychain Access. Open Terminal and make a backup of your login keychain. \ncp ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain{,-old}\n\n\n*\n\n*You now have two keychains in your keychain folder named login.keychain and login.keychain-old.

I would like to add a title above or below a photo that is open in Preview.  I know how to annotate the photo that writes over the photo.  I want to add a new blank area where I can put the annotation.\n\nA: The above methods didn't work for me - once saved the image would revert back to the old dimensions. Adding an extra step made it work. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open in preview\n\n*Copy the image\n\n*Resize the image to desired size using Tools > Adjust Size\n\n*Paste back in the original image (and position it as necessary)\n\n*Add two lines in preview that span the entire image\n\n*Set the colour of the lines to fully transparent\n\n\nThe final image has the desired dimensions with blank space around it.\n\nA: Here's the hack I did, maybe it will help other people:\n\n*\n\n*Get the size in pixels of what you want the canvas to be\n\n*Generate an image of that size here: https://placehold.it/{W}x{H} (e.g. https://placehold.it/350x1136)\n\n*Copy the image (Control click, copy image)\n\n*Open Preview, press ⌘ command + N or File > New From Clipboard\n\n*In the new image, select all ( ⌘ command + A) then hit delete\n\n*Copy your original image(s) into your new canvas, reposition as needed\n\nIt's a hack, but it works. If you need anything more precise, then you'll probably need a proper photo editor.\n\nA: A simplified method that works just as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your picture in Preview.\n\n*⌘ command + A and then ⌘ command + C to copy it to the clipboard.\n\n*Go to Tools > Adjust Size... and enlarge the image to the overall size you want for the canvas.

I haven't tried any of the free apps that show up. \n\nA: That means adjusting a bitmap canvas, which is really a full fledged photo editor kind of job, I highly recommend pixelmator. \nThough if you don't care about image quality, one could have the text you care about in a window just above or below the picture and take a screenshot of the picture+words. \n", "Q: Kill TCP connections on a Mac in Terminal I just want to kill a specific tcp connection on my mac (similar to tcpkill on linux).

It is part of the dsniff package which is in MacPorts. You said you don't want to install other software. Nevertheless MacPorts is really useful if you work from the command line.

The suggested solution there is to create a function that kills all connection on a specific port:\nfunction killport() { lsof -i TCP:$1 | awk '/LISTEN/ {print $2}' | xargs kill -9 }\n\nIf you change the function by taking away the argument the function should kill all applications that have an open TCP connection.\nfunction killport() { lsof -i TCP | awk '/LISTEN/ {print $2}' | xargs kill -9 }\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't tested this.\nDisclaimer 2: It's a brute force method and can have some serious side effects. I would recommend against this approach.\n\nA: FWIW, you have to install openssl@1.0 in order for dsniff to compile successfully.\n", "Q: How do I selectively sync music to my iPhone?

When I set up my Roadrunner email acct it downloaded over 300 from the main server to my inbox. I looked for a way to delete multiple email but there doesn't seem to be any method for that. As I was playing around with all the mailboxes, I did something because my inbox still says over 300 yet It only shows the current ones. ( I am keeping up to date deleting all incoming ) \nHow do I find the phantom 300 ?  I've looked in every folder !  \n\nA: I feel your pain. I am also an RR client. Don't know if you are a native Apple person or if you are straddling the Windows-Apple barbed wire saddle. I wanted to share this with you, in case you ever look for an answer again (I see it was June when you posted). I found several \"tips\" about deleting lots of emails, but never like a \"select all\" and then deselecting a few you want to keep. [Ed: Duh. Why not build in a feature that consumers have led the market to KNOW is expected for maybe 2 decades now .... duh again, sorry for the redundancy)\nRecently (viz. tonite) I deleted over 5000 emails from the iPad \"mail\" app. Took me almost 2 hours. It was much easier (and obviously successful) than following the exact steps in the online tips.\nI open the native \"mail\" app. I select an inbox. I select \"edit\" so I can delete emails. I spend a lot of time [over and over] selecting one email at a time [this is where they could really help us out if they \"allowed\" some kind of a batch feature]. After selecting between 70-100 emails, I carefully select \"move\" - I say \"carefully\" because if you accidentally (I say this from repeated experience) get in a hurry, and select \"move\" as a single touch, nothing you do next will apply to all those dozens of hateful emails you want to delete.\nSo let's say you now have selected 86 emails, within the email app, in one inbox. Carefully SELECT-AND-HOLD-DOWN-FOR-SEVERAL-SECONDS \"move\" – you will see images of the group of emails layering on the right. You will next be taken to a screen listing WHERE to move these emails. Carefully select \"trash\". Boom - there they go, into the \"trash\", but they are not yet deleted. That is a separate step (see B below).\nSo, I did this repeatedly until I had about 300-400 emails in the trash. STEP B: Then you go back to the main menu for mail: select \"trash\". Select \"edit\" on the next page. At the bottom of the iPad screen, carefully select \"delete\" then VERY carefully select \"delete all\". I say again - carefully - because a hurried and careless \"selection\" (i.e., touch of the screen) will leave you nowhere you want to be - in short, undoing some aspect of all your efforts.\nSo - you delete individual emails by selecting them one at a time within the inbox [you will need to do this in the \"sent\" folder etc. if you want to remove other accumulations] - then you carefully move them to trash. Then after a little clutch of them are in the trash, open \"trash\" and select them and delete all of them.\nDo this from 1 to 145,567 ... util all those dumb emails are gone.\nWhat I want to know, is how to get rid of these 108 emails that “seem” to be in one inbox but they are nowhere to be found.\nI have researched this for over a year, maybe close to 2 years now without success.\nGood luck to us both.\n", "Q: Small Windows 7 on Bootcamp I am using MacBook Air 13\".\nI need to install Windows 7 on my MB to run some software.\nI have about 30GB free space on my MB.\nIs there any Windows 7 distribution that uses less space and works with Bootcamp?\n\nA: Straight from Microsoft editions of Windows are all the same size, the feature sets are unlocked by what edition you've paid for. \n\n\n*\n\n*professional\n\n*enterprise\n\n*home and business\n\n*student \n\n*ultimate  \n\n\nAll of them take up the same amount of space, but some have limited access to features. \n\nI would install the windows partition to an external drive.\nYou might be able to squeak by with 30GB if you have less than 4GB of windows files. \n", "Q: how to add few music files to iPhone which is \"manually managed\" by a different PC?

I take hundreds of these per month and edit, let's say, about 500 per month. And sometimes I'll go back a week later and tweak a batch some more. \nCould someone explain, in detail, how the back-up process works? I'd like to be able to figure out how large of a back up drive I should get. \nIs it backing up/creating a new image file after every tweak of every knob I make in LightRoom? \nActually, somewhat related, is this how lightroom works? It comes with a \"history\" feature and I wonder how it is I can revert a photo on lightroom if it was to not create a copy over and over while I'm editing. \n\nA: \nCould someone explain, in detail, how the back-up process works? \n\nYes. Nobody better than the late Pondini, however: How Time Machine Works its Magic. Essentially, the first time you backup a machine, a full clone of the internal drive (with the exception of a few unneeded directories) occurs. Thereafter, every hour an incremental backup occurs, where all changes to the drive are backed up. For everything that hasn't changed, hard links are created to the full version . After 24 hours, hourly backups are pruned and consolidated into a daily backup. The same process extends to daily backups after a week (all daily backups from that week are consolidated to one week).\n\nI'd like to be able to figure out how large of a back up drive I should get.\n\nIt is recommended to purchase a drive at least twice the size of the drive (or cumulative size of drives) you are backing up. \n\nIs it backing up/creating a new image file after every tweak of every knob I make in LightRoom?\n\nNo, not Time Machine at least. Only hourly. Every hour, time machine reads changes from the file system events store and backs up any folder in which file changes within it have occurred. \n\nis this how lightroom works? It comes with a \"history\" feature and I\n  wonder how it is I can revert a photo on lightroom if it was to not\n  create a copy over and over while I'm editing.\n\nI can't speak to exactly how lightroom works, but in doing so it's taking advantage of the same features Time Machine is taking advantage of: an HFS+ (journaled) file system in which changes are routinely catalogued by OS X itself. This allows programs to retain previous versions of files in their cache. Even TextEdit, for example, allows one to revert to previous versions without Time machine even enabled. \n\nA: tl;dr Get a big drive, like 2TB if you plan on all of those pictures. \nIt scans for identical files and backs up any that are different. So in theory there is one copy of OS files that never change, and that's it. \n(If you had a book, and added a space June 8, you could check June 7 and see a different file.\nHowever, there are times where Time Machine will preserve the book in 1.doc and a tiny file that says add a space after line 17 character 5, that is 2.doc. This is a proprietary system and I don't know the rules for when that happens. This is even more powerful with the OS feature Versions, which Adobe would have to enable to make useful.)\nTime Machine also keeps hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly backups. I forget which time period those sort by, but that will save you some space, when it dumps in between versions. \n\nA: In case the OP isn't aware Lightroom does not alter your original image files. Instead it maintains a single SQLLite database file with all your image edits. \nIf you copy a file from Finder it will not reflect any edits made in Lightroom. You need to export the image from Lightroom, at which point LR makes a new copy of your photo with the edits 'baked in'.\nThus Time Machine only needs to back up your image files the first time it runs after you have uploaded them. It will however have to copy a new version of the database file every time you make changes. And that database can become pretty large - my database for ~85K photos is 1.25GB.  \n", "Q: Using VPN and Wifi at the same time I have a VPN to connect to my school's IT department (I volunteer with them), but I am having a problem.\nI have added the VPN to the Network Interface list in System Preferences, and can connect just fine. However, let's say I try to ping the server:\nPING server_name (67.63.55.3): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 67.63.55.3: icmp_seq=0 ttl=241 time=95.298 ms\n\nBut this IP is not the server... it is my ISP's DNS hijacking page (as established here).\nSo then I change the Service Order in System Preferences: I move the VPN above my wifi connection. Now I can ping and connect to the server just fine, through my school's internal DNS server.\nBut now, I cannot browse the internet. Because I have moved the VPN above my Wifi connection, my Mac tries to route all internet traffic through the VPN. However, the VPN does not have internet throughput: it is only for connecting to internal servers. So I ping google:\nPING www.google.com (67.218.93.49): 56 data bytes\nRequest timeout for icmp_seq 0\n\nWhich is, of course, bad. Either I can have internet connectivity, or I can have VPN. But not both at the same time.\nSo, you might say, \"You can just tell the VPN to handle specific IPs!\" But that doesn't work, because then when I try to ping the server hostname, who's DNS gets the request? My ISP! (instead of my school). If my ISP would not DNS hijack, maybe this would work.\nSo my question is: Is there some way I can tell my Mac to forward requests that fail on the VPN (like www.google.com, etc) on to the next Network Service, being my Wifi?\nPretty much I want to consult my school DNS first and my real DNS second.\nThanks.\n\nA: I was about to give up on this. I had tried numerous modifications across the system, and nothing would work.\nBut then I found a simple solution... laughably simple:\nIn Network preferences, choose your primary interface, and hit Advanced.... For me, this was wi-fi, but the same thing should work for ethernet, etc. Whatever you normally use to connect to the internet\nIn the DNS tab (where you may already have entries), add the VPN DNS.  Also make sure that your main DNS(s) are there. Then, add the VPN domain into the search domains box.\nExample:\nVPN settings http://elibaum.com/img/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-18%20at%2021.18.22.png\nHere, 10.0.1.1 is my home wifi router, which in turn routes to my ISP's DNS servers. 10.8.1.22 is the local DNS server on the VPN.\nSo, if I request www.google.com, the request is sent to my router, whether or not I am on VPN.\nHowever, if I request server while on the VPN, the primary DNS fails, and moves on to the next nameserver. However, since this nameserver (10.8.1.22 in my case) is on the VPN's subnet, traffic is automagically routed to the VPN. The search domain field example.com transforms server into server.example.com, and the DNS lookup succeeds.\nImportant Note: this workaround requires that your primary DNS fails on non-existent domains — that is, your ISP is not doing DNS hijacking. If they are, switch to OpenDNS, Google Public DNS, etc. Also see my related question: https://superuser.com/questions/766713/what-is-67-63-55-3 in which I sorted out DNS hijacking in relation to this problem.\n", "Q: Windows Word License for Mac Windows Will my Office for windows license work for office on mac?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated….Thanks\n\nA: As Rob said, your lid switch might be the problem.\nI would suggest following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset your SMC and the PRAM/NVRAM.\n\n*Run Apple Hardware test to see if it comes up with anything.\n\n*Check your Pmset -g profile.\nFYI:\nThere are 2 small magnets mounted on the lid (along the top edge)\nYou can find them by using paper clip. \nOn the opposite side (of closed lid) there are 2 sensors, that normally should last forever (unless you put a strong magnet on them so they are stuck now), but then there is nothing that does.\n", "Q: Prevent OSX from auto-detecting and deleting dates in iCal, Reminders I use iCal's month view, so when creating an event I put it as all-day and put the event time in the title, like so: \"3:30 meeting with Steve\", \"9am-10am TYO-NYC flight\" (if you find it unusual, I'm not the only one doing this, and this style has benefits such as when dealing with time zones). iCal promptly removes the time from the title and changes the event from all-day to the new time, so I have to edit it again.\nSame thing with Reminders application. Even more annoyingly, if you put a link containing a date (eg. http://www.tofugu.com/2013/06/04/how-to-write-letters-in-japanese-an-introduction/), it will convert this to a \"remind me on this day\" date as well.\nIt looks like it cannot be turned off anywhere in Preferences, but maybe there is a setting accessible from the command line?\n(So far I found only one suggestion online, and it was to type the date twice - iCal will remove one date, but keep the other. While this works, it's annoying and you still need to change the even back to \"all-day\" and I hope there's a better way.)\nI'm running Maverick with all the latest updates.\n\nA: Since data detectors are handled by Mail & not iCal itself you may turn this feature of with the following command entered in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableDataDetectors YES\n\nTo revert this behaviour:\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableDataDetectors NO\n\nPlease note that any time detection features of Mail are turned of as well.\n\nA: iCal is to clever for its own good, it automatically assume you want to have a event at 3:30.\nI use the same system as you with worldwide travel and timezones.\nI use a trick to fool the iCal.\nJust do not use the correct time format so iCal wont know it is time but you will :)\nnot 3:30\nuse 3,30 \nnow it thinks it is text not time.\n\nTo your second question. about Reminders, I pasted that link as reminder tittle and it stay put to the date I want, so maybe you need to explain that problem.\n\nA: I just recently updated from Mountain Lion to El Capitan and discovered that the iCal option to not show event time in month view was no longer available. I found a work around by checking \"all day\" and putting the time either in the location or notes area. Now the event time does not take up space in the event title line. I double click on the event line to see the time if I have to. Good for me for now until Apple fixes this. Of course this means the time does not show up in any other view as well, so it's only a temporary fix. I did post feedback to Apple about this iCal oversight using the link provided on this page.\n", "Q: iSight Camera in iPhone 5 , 5s, 5c: Is the image resolution 3264 x 2448 or 3284 x 2448?

When I turn on my macbook pro late 2011 I want it to use the integrated video card(not discrete one). \nIs there some sort of setting I can set or a driver I can install or some bios setting to achieve this?\n\nA: Yes, you can achieve that modifying certain EFI variable. I answered this other question with the full procedure to permanently disable discrete graphics card on startup.\n\nA: Your machine should boot with the integrated card by default. \n\n\n*\n\n*Under System Preferences > Energy Saver > make sure \"Automatic Graphics Switching\" or (depending on your OSX) \"Better Battery Life\" is checked. \n\n*Download and install gfxCardStatus. Reboot your machine. Before you do anything else at login, from its drop down menu, check the PID causing the system to switch to the discrete card. Once you isolate the process, you can isolate the application causing it to do so using Activity Monitor. \n\nA: You cannot force the OS X to use the integrated GPU if you have dual GPU (integrated + descrete). By default OS X will use descrete GPU when booting.\nAnyway, if you were a victim of infamous GPU failure for MacBook Pros in Late 2011, Apple was fixing it for free.

I have a new iPhone 4s. When I take photos away from my WiFi connection, the pictures do not appear in my photo stream on my iPad. \nCan this be easily remedied?\nPhoto stream is turned on on both devices and I've just done a backup to see if that helped. It didn't.\n\nA: The short answer is you cannot - it works only when the device is connected over WiFi.\nQuoting from iCloud: My Photo Stream FAQ (emphasis at the end mine):\n\nWhen do photos upload to My Photo Stream?\nWhen you enable My Photo Stream on your devices, all new photos you take or import to those devices will be automatically added to your photo stream.\niOS devices: New photos you take are automatically uploaded to your photo stream when you leave the Camera app and are connected to Wi-Fi. My Photo Stream does not push photos over cellular connections.\n\n\nSuch limitations are usually imposed by Apple because cellular Internet is quite expensive in most places when compared to DSL/cable broadband. So uploading photos that are a few MBs each could quickly run the bill up to a hefty amount. Another example of limitations on cellular connection is App Store downloads, where iOS will only download an app or update if it's smaller than 100MB in size when the device is connected over cellular.\n", "Q: Script to click app on Menu Bar on Mavericks I use an application called NoSleep.  Technically it is a Kernel Extension.

I only have one issue.  I want the NoSleep feature ON when the computer boots and performs auto login.  By default NoSleep is running but in an  off state.  To toggle on, you simply click (once) the NoSleep icon on the system bar (up where volume, dropbox etc shows up), upper right.\nI would like a simple AppleScript that I can run at startup as an App using System Preferences/ Users and Groups / login items.  That just clicks that icon.\n\nA: Although this is not an ApplesSript (and I would still like to know how to resolve the question via clicking etc) there is another way to skin the cat.  The application can be installed with a command line interface.

To preface this: I'm sure this has been asked but I don't know exactly what I'm searching for or what terms to use, so I am going to ask here by explaining my situation.\nI am logged onto a network OS on a host machine (10.9) and I need to view and edit files on the Macintosh HD that is on this actual host machine. The reason why I need to do this is the user's machine is kernel panicking because of a Trend Micro kext in his OS. Whenever I try to go into the user library on Macintosh HD to delete the plists as well, I get \"Permission Denied\" even when using sudo. I do have the username and password of the user that I'm trying to edit so my question is: How do I log in, through terminal, as that user to edit things inside that users Library folder? \nHopefully this makes sense -- if not let me know and I can try to clarify further.\nEdit: To further explain myself and why I'm going about it this way is simply because I'm curious. If I boot into safe mode it works just fine as it doesn't load the kext. I'm just wondering how this would be done.\n\nA: Let's say that the user you are trying to become is 'newuser', we'll use the 'su' command (switch user) like so as follows...\nStart the terminal and enter:\nsudo su - newuser\n\nWhen prompted enter YOUR password (not newuser's password)\nWhen done you should be logged in to a terminal window as that user.\n", "Q: What does the indicator on Settings>Privacy>Facebook mean on an iPhone In iOS Settings, what do the items listed in Privacy>Facebook control?\nIf it is green does that mean I am limiting Facebook's access to my data?  Or do I need to turn it off to limit Facebook's access?  I'm very confused and the screen doesn't help guide you.\n\nA: Settings->Privacy lists the social accounts that iOS can store info for. If you go into one of them, such as Facebook, you will see a list of individual apps on your phone that want to access those accounts to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a network session. \n\n*Get the activity feed for a user. \n\n*Make a new post. \n\n*Set properties on a post, add attachments, etc. \n\n*Publish a post to an activity feed.\n\n\nIf the toggle next to the app is green, then you have given permission to that app to do these activities. If the toggle is not green, then the app has requested permission, but you have denied it.\nIt is interesting in that Facebook is also listed as an app looking for Facebook data.  This lets it keep using the login and password you've entered if you've shared something on Facebook from another app.\n", "Q: iTunes Match and Library on NAS I just got a new MacBookAir for my home. It will primarily be used at home with some occasional use out of the house. I would like to use the iTunes server on my Synology NAS to store a downloaded copy of my iTunes libray for use a time. My understanding is that I can do this by pointing iTunes to the iTunes server directory on my NAS. Here's the issue, I believe that when I am out of the house, it will search for that library and not find it. Will iTunes know to automatically revert to iTunes Match streaming if it can't find the library?\n\nA: It will not be able to automatically switch. What you'll have to do is create a new iTunes library that is used for streaming only. To do this, open iTunes while holding the Option key. Then selected \"Create new library\" and name it something different, I used \"iTunes Streaming\". Then, simply turn on iTunes Match and you'll see all your playlists populate. Once you do this, you'll be able to stream all your music directly from Apple.

Last year I took out the optical drive, replaced it with the original hard drive and installed a 256GB SSD in its place. I then setup Win7 on a small (75GB) partition. \nThe Windows partition is now full so I bought another 256GB SSD with the intention of dedicating the whole drive to Bootcamp.\nSo now it looks like I have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone the Bootcamp partition to the new SSD and swap them out\n\n*Run Boot Camp assistant and install a fresh Windows 7 system on the SSD.\n\n\nI'm not sure if the first method will work - I worry the system will detect the hardware has changed and grumble/break if I do this. Also, Apple Disk utility can't work with NTFS format drives and there is a plethora of cloning utilities to choose from.\nThe problem with method 2 is that Bootcamp will only setup Windows from the CD drive installed in the bay and of course that's where my new SSD lives. I don't think my MBP can boot from USB so my original plan to create a bootable thumbdrive will almost certainly fail.\nI would really appreciate your comments and suggestions.\n\nA: Your first solution should be fine. Windows may grumble about having to reactivate, though, since it sees hardware changing. There another question over at Superuser that discusses software to clone Windows drives. Just make sure that you format the new SSD with a GUID partition table before you do the cloning, though (you can do the partition table formatting in Disk Utility, or have Boot Camp Assistant do the formatting for you).\nYou can also temporarily swap out the old SSD with the optical drive, which is often what I end up doing.\n", "Q: Why do some windows not appear in the app switcher even when not hidden or minimized?

Any recommendation? What professional graphic card would be better for design games in 3D?\n\nA: I actually wouldn't worry about it too much for Unity3D and Blender - both are very efficient.  UE4 seems to be a bit less efficient.\nIn the past I've really liked NVidia, but on my late 2011 MacBook Pro (with 8G of normal ram) I'm using a AMD Radeon HD 6750M 1024 MB (only 1G graphics!) and am very happy.  Well, happy with Unity3D and Blender that is.  It runs a bit hot sometimes if I have lots of particle effects and such - but I use a fan control software that helps a bunch.  So, I'm thinking either card you've chosen should work for those two apps.\nFor UE, I'd go to the forums over there.  Last time I used Unreal, I had to run the Windows version and was using Parallels. I was woefully under-powered for that but, I was still able to grade a bunch of students senior capstones (big projects).  So, even my set-up worked.

So I'm about to copy files off a system partition, and I'm afraid I'll have problems with permissions.\nA bit of background - OS X won't boot (looping progress bar) and Mavericks Recovery's Disk Utility says it can't repair it. Files are viewable in MacDrive on the Boot Camp partition (which I'm using, so I don't think the disk has failed, just something wrong with that particular partition).\nMy plan is to remove the drive and mount it on another Mac and see what I can copy.\nThing is I've recall having bad experiences with doing things like this in the past - I'm afraid there will be permission issues somewhere down the road when I try to use these copied files.\nIdeally I'd like to copy the files, and apply them with \"default\" permissions from my working Mac, as if those files had been created the working Mac, and not the failed Mac.\nI don't want to access my files and not be able to/having to authenticate, because they \"belong\" to another user (i.e. the account on my old Mac).\ntl;dr is there a way to copy another user account's (mine) files from a system drive, without running into permissions problems down the road? Maybe stripping the files of all user account-related permissions?\n\nA: The simple solution to this is to reset all the permissions on all copied files to everyone read/write and let the system handle fixing them.\nReset all the permissions on a folder and its contents recursively with:\nchmod -R 777 /path/to/folder\n\nThen, run Repair Permissions in Disk Utility, and reset the ACLs on your home folder using the ACL tool on the Recovery HD:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into the Recovery HD using ⌘R.\n\n*Run resetpassword in Terminal (available from Utilities → Terminal).\n\n*Select your account from the drop-down list.\n\n*Click the Reset button for Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs.\n\n", "Q: AppleScript to click buttons and close tabs Im not really familiar with applescript (using C/Python/Pacsal atm).

There are lots of built-in actions in the \"Internet\" subsection of Library, Website Popup looks promising for you. \nIf that all fails or you want something quick and dirty, pressing the Record button up at the top right will record your screen and keyboard inputs, as well as events for you. You could just code a loop to run the generated code over and over again N times, but be warned that Watch Me Do (the thing activated by record) is only screen scraping. If those links ever move or your window isn't in the same place, the script will bomb, probably clicking on things you don't want it to at all, so be careful!\n", "Q: Force a read-only mount of startup disk I want to create a MacOS recovery startup disk on a USB flash drive. In order to maintain the integrity of the drive's contents (and, perhaps more importantly, reduce write wear on the flash drive from tmp files, swapping, SpotLight, etc.), I'd like to be able to have the kernel mount the drive read-only (but otherwise boot into a full-featured desktop environment where various GUI-based recovery tools are available).\nThis is obviously possible when booting from CD/DVD (and probably when booting from a flash drive with a physical write-protect switch), but I suspect the hardware state just magically causes the kernel/bootloader to do the right thing.\nBack in the day, I recall that some systems had the ability to specify boot arguments that would force behavior like this.  Scanning the OpenFirmware command and MacOS boot-args cheat sheets reveals nothing obvious.\nIs there any way to request that the firmware or kernel make the boot device be read-only for a multi-user boot?  Or, alternately, is there a way to continue startup from single-user mode while keeping the boot device in a read-only state?\n\nA: The install CDs took a lot of shortcuts to deal with read-only boot volumes. One of the tricks is to mount the swap partition in a ramdisk - yes, it sounds rather pointless to swap your RAM to another part of memory, but I expect it was easier to do that than to rewrite the kernel to not swap at all. Make the GUI single-application and you won't need swap anyway.\nIf you are making a maintenance drive rather than a one-task USB installer I would recommend a spinning external. Faster than most USB thumb drives and it will have enough space to recover data. Get a 500Gb external, partition it into a 50Gb boot volume with CCC, DiskWarrior, DataRescue and whatever else you like, a standard recovery partition, and the rest for user data. \n", "Q: Launchd Multicast Socket Listener I'm not sure if I've just missed some documentation or not, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to set up a launchd agent that can be triggered whenever a datagram is received within a multicast group.\nWhat I'd like to know is what a launchd plist should look like to provide a simple datagram listener that is bound to a multicast group.\nHere's what I've been trying:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>foo.bar</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/foo/bar</string>\n    <key>Sockets</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Listeners</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>SockType</key>\n            <string>dgram</string>\n            <key>SockServiceName</key>\n            <string>12345</string>\n            <key>SockFamily</key>\n            <string>IPv4</string>\n            <key>MulticastSocket</key>\n            <string>224.0.0.253</string>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n    <key>inetdCompatibility</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Wait</key>\n        <false/>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nBut it just generates getaddrinfo errors (\"nodename nor servname provided, or not known\").

But, according to Intel Power Gadget, most of the time the frequency is much lower. Even during intensive usage. It's 0.8-1.6 Ghz.\nI noticed that some operations work slower than they could.\nSo I'm wondering, is there a way to change default CPU frequency policy? You know, on Windows there are 3 modes, on Linux there are also several options (ondemand, performance, conservative, powersave etc.)\n\nA: Run the command top in the Terminal. This will tell you where all your CPU and/or memory is going in more detail than activity monitor (man top to learn more about it). My immediate assumption is that your CPU isn't maxing out because it has no reason to. The default power management by both Apple and Intel does its job very well; I would guess you get this slow tab switching when you have lots of applications open, or a few very large ones. \nIf your Mac is taking time to compress and expand memory, it will run slower. If (heaven forbid) you have actually used more memory than you have physical RAM, your MacBook is dumping dynamic data to the hard drive. This will run SUPER slow, but use relatively few clock cycles.\n\nA: Running a home made multithread prime calculator on a Quad i7 2.0Ghz here's what I have :\n\nAs you can see, it goes beyond the nominal CPU speed and reach the Boost limit (2.6Ghz).\nSo I conclude that it depend of how the software is written and how it manage the CPU usage.\nSo Mac OS seems to automatically allow resources to need it.

The current version of CrashPlan is 3.6.4. \nTo resolve this issue: \n - Download the current version\n - Use the 'uninstall' script on the disk image to remove your current installation.\n - Reboot.\n - Install the new version\nThis also resolves some issues with display and Wireless network detection under Yosemite.\nI've not tested to see if just upgrading over the top of the old installation also fixes the issue.\n", "Q: Using tab key to advance to next file in Finder for numerically ordered files I have a directory of files named like:\nit(0).png\nit(1).png\nit(2).png\n...\nit(10).png\nit(11).png\n...\n\nIn Finder my directory is arranged by Name and the files are in correct numerical order.

If I plugged in, it shows at Audio MIDI setup and I can choose number of speakers, so I choose 6 speakers, because I have 5 + 1 speakers connected in my sweex sound card. I tested it by clicking to every speaker in midi setup and all speakers work correctly, which is fine, but...\nWhat if I want to play stereo sound through all speakers? If I play some music from youtube for example, I can hear only two speakers.\nSo I've done some googling and found something called JackPilot, which allows me to do what I want, but you have to start JackPilot server first and after that set routing for every application separately.\nI am looking for a some unified solution which will work after reboot without additional configurations. I guess Mac OS X does not provide such a feature out of the box, but I would be happy if something would exist, e.g. some 3rd party application.\n\nA: Aggregate Device\nYou can setup an Aggregate Device (Audio Midi Setup > Create Aggregate Device), which allows the ability to combine multiple devices of the same model, or to combine multiple inputs and outputs for apps that don't support separate input and output devices. This Apple guide shows how it works and is surprisingly quite easy to setup. \nSoundFlower\nAnother way to route audio to multiple channels and outputs (up to 64) is with the free app/plug-in Soundflower. You can download a ready-to-use version, or compile the source code yourself if you have the desire to specifically modify the application.

Will I be able to just update my OS as a regular copy or will I again need to search for and download an updated copy off the torrent? What happens when Apple finally releases the official copy come fall? Will I be able to just hit the Software Update option in the Apple menu and get it done or will I have to download the whole shebang all over again?\nP.S. I understand there are risks involved with installing Dev Previews and am not worried about them. Thanks.\n\nA: These are questions that can't really be answered until after it happens. They are the risks that you take when doing what you describe. You can look at past examples of what Apple has done or find people who did the same as what you want to do now with previous versions, however none of that will be fact as we just don't know what Apple will do this time around until they do it.\nAs you mentioned, this is the Developer's preview. If you're not a developer then you shouldn't be installing it -- but you don't need me to tell you that. As for the public beta program, I think you misunderstood it, or else I did. I understood it as the first million did not get access to the developer preview version, but will get access to the public beta version when it is released later during the summer.\nThis would make sense as I'm sure they don't want to give a million essentially consumers access to the first developer release until after the developers have had some time to review and the first few batches of bugs get worked out. Once it's a little more stable and tested, then they will give out access to the public beta.\nA few quotes from the beta site:\nThe beta program is limited to the first million, not the first million get the developer's preview:\n\nJoin the OS X Beta Program and help make the next release of OS X our\n  best yet.

Every time I do so, it fails at 90% with the following error message.\nError: Unable to proceed with the installation\n\nWhen I go to troubleshoot the problem, I find that I have version 13.0.0.214 of Flash Player installed on my system, and that the (alleged) latest version (for Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8) is 13.0.0.201 (see following URL).\nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/installation-problems-flash-player-rvm.html\nFurther research has revealed that the latest version of Flash Player (for Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9) is 14.0.0.125 (see following URL).\nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/installation-problems-flash-player-mac.html#main-pars_heading_7\nThis is not the first time I have experienced problems upgrading Adobe Flash Player. I experienced a similar problem before upgrading to Mac OS X 10.9 except with different version numbers of the same software. That is, the version that was installed was greater than the version that was downloaded. Note that I did not experience this problem with prior versions of the OS (i.e. Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7).\nThis time I went one step further and used a different default browser to locate, download and install (what I presumed was the latest version of) Flash Player. No difference....\nMy question is, why does my default browser point to an older version of the installation software, and how can I resolve this? Also, correct me if I am wrong but, the reason I have a 'later' version of the software (that is, version 13.0.0.214) is due to the OS upgrade? I do not recall ever upgrading Adobe Flash Player....\nNot sure whether or not this is relevant, but I also have Adobe Creative Suite 5 installed on my system (which was also successfully upgraded during all OS upgrades).\n\nUPDATE: Did a bit more searching on the Adobe forums and found a link to a previous version of Adobe Flash Player version 13.0.0.223. Although not the latest version, I have successfully installed it. That is, after I uninstalled the older version of Flash Player. The problem I experienced sounds almost identical to this installation problem.\nI am still, however, experiencing the same problem when upgrading to version 14 of Flash Player (even through System Preferences). Seems to be a problem with the installer, and not my system configuration since, to resolve this problem, I uninstall Flash Player (like before) and successfully installed Flash Player version 14 OS X, which I found and downloaded from the same web site.  Note that all attempts to use the install program that updates Adobe Flash Player have failed.\n\nUPDATE 2: It appears that the problem I described is a known issue regarding installing Flash Player on OS X 10.9 using the shim installer from get.adobe.com/flashplayer. For further details, see the following thread from the Adobe Forums.\n\nA: I've have this problem come and go, and come back again. \nFIX: The best fix so far for me is to go back to Flash Version 13. The say Flash Player Version 13 is in \"extended release\". I am on Mac osx 10.7.5 the last version of mac operating system for my machine.\nFind it here: for browsers, it may have the strange name \"plug in content debugger\", I think the word \"plug in\" matters for browsers. The other \"projector\" versions I don't know about. The \"plug in debugger version 13\" fixed my safari problems. \nhttps://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html\nFix 2: You must disregard the constant signaling to update to version 15 if you are getting it. The update to version 15 may load a broken version in the browser, then you have to uninstall it with their special utility and reinstall version 13. Get the uninstall download here (or search for adobe flash uninstall on the web):  \nhttp://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html#main_uninstall\nMore Possible Explanation:\nApparently the weird name \"debugger\" means they have debugged common problems with it. Essentially you are going back to the previous version since the new one has problems loading/working (keeps getting identified as out-of-date so it won't work) but they don't want to pull the new version off the market, can you imagine that mess. Thanks Adobe for the extended release we depend on it! \nHere is adobe's comment on it: \nEXTENDED SUPPORT RELEASE - FLASH PLAYER\nWhat is the extended support release?\nAdobe makes available a version of Flash Player called the \"Extended Support Release\" (ESR) to organizations that prefer Flash Player stability over new functionality. We have created a branch of the Flash Player code that we keep up to date with all of the latest security updates, but none of the new features or bug fixes available in our current release branch. This allows organizations to certify and stay secure on Flash Player with minimal effort.\n10/14/2014 - Updated debugger and standalone versions of Flash Player. These players contain fixes for critical vulnerabilities identified in Security Bulletin APSB14-22. The latest version is 13.0.0.250 (Win and Mac). All users are encouraged to update to these latest versions.\n\nA: Coming in late here. I've had this recurring problem, where FF disables Flash, then I forget how to get past the installer failure. The issue I've experienced is that the installer fails around the 90% mark with the error message that is the title of this thread.\nThe solution that's worked for me is to find and download the full package installer. There's no need to downgrade to an extended release version.\nJust now I installed the latest Flash 18.x this way on Mountain Lion.\nThe issue seems to be the ActiveX based installer itself. By downloading the full installer, you get a familiar mac .dmg file, containing a familiar mac .pkg file. Click on this, and it runs a typical mac software install process.\nYou don't even have to stop the browser to complete the install, though it's a good idea once the install is finished.\nHere is the latest download, and the page I found it on, which may or may not contain future full installer downloads. When selecting the dmg, it's the one Adobe calls \"for system administrators\".\nhttp://www.adobe.com/sea/products/flashplayer/distribution3.html\nhttps://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/licensing/mac/install_flash_player_18_osx_pkg.dmg\n\nA: On my MacBook Air with 10.9.3 I currently have the Adobe Flash Player-- Plug-in version 13.0.0.214 is installed.\nIt seems that is the correct version since I do Auto Update and leave it to Adobe to decide the right version for my system.\nSo I just did the update to version 14.

Once that is done the Installation will successfully complete.\nYou can try the Adobe troubleshooting to uninstall the older version on your Mac.\n\nA: This is very helpful because I had a similar problem with the Flash update released in June 2014.  I could download the update, etc., but it wouldn't install.  No luck with uninstalling the program and trying to start anew.  I successfully installed Flash a bit ago by clicking on the link to version 13.0.0.223 in the answer above. \n\nA: This drove me nuts.

This seems to work but I notice that the IP on a device connected to the router is 192.168.2.14. \nI'm curious to know which IP range internet connection sharing will use by default and whether this can be changed via the terminal.\nI'm currently on Mountain Lion but also interested in any relevant differences in Mavericks.\nifconfig shows:\nbridge0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether ac:de:48:08:15:b5 \n    inet 192.168.2.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255\n    Configuration:\n        priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0 maxage 0\n        ipfilter disabled flags 0x2\n    member: en0 flags=3<LEARNING,DISCOVER>\n             port 5 priority 0 path cost 0\n\nIs this bridge the mechanism for internet sharing? \n\nA: Sorry: I'm a bit short of time and so this isn't a complete answer, but hopefully it gives you a starting point.\nFrom the answers to this question, it seems that /usr/libexec/InternetSharing creates /etc/bootpd.plist when Internet Sharing is turned on, and removes it again when it is turned off.  I think this file is the cause for the ifconfig values you are seeing.\nOn my machine, when it exists, among other things, that file contains \n        <key>net_address</key>\n        <string>192.168.2.0</string>\n        <key>net_mask</key>\n        <string>255.255.255.0</string>\n        <key>net_range</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>192.168.2.2</string>\n            <string>192.168.2.254</string>\n        </array>\n\nI'm guessing that 192.168.2 is the default range, as my machine is producing the same results as yours.\nI think you could try modifying /etc/bootpd.plist once the file has been created to set your own range.  You might then need to restart bootp.\nI don't know how to configure InternetSharing to use a different default.  (I had a brief look at /System/Library/CoreServices/InternetSharing.bundle and the output of strings /usr/libexec/InternetSharing, but couldn't see anything obvious.)  One of the answers  to the question I mentioned above suggests creating a cron job or launch agent to overwrite the /etc/bootpd.plist with the settings you require automatically.\nThese details are for Mavericks.  If I understand right, Mountain Lion uses named instead: see the question, and the article it refers to also.\nHowever... bootp is only the subsystem that tells your other devices what addresses they should use (via DHCP).  The Mac also has to forward packets from those devices to your wireless connection, and vice versa.  I don't know how that forwarding is configured, and it might well be set up to forward only packets from/to the 192.168.2 subnet.\n\nA: The default range is 192.168.0.*\n", "Q: iPhone 5 and iPad Air calendar Time Zones My calendar on both my iPhone 5 and iPad Air is beyond screwed up. The most common problem is that an entry moves from the time I set for it.\nI live in France but I purchased the phone in New York. I thought I found the problem to be related to a time zone preference. \nIt always defaults to New York no matter how many times I change it to Central European Time. \nSo I started specifying the Paris time zone on every entry. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\nAnd when I travel to another time zone I have no idea if any of my entries are accurate, mostly not. I really have a very simple calendar life. No linking with other people or work accounts. I don't want to completely reset my devices. \nAny thoughts on how to resolve this?\n\nA: Check the following \"Settings\".  Make sure under \"General > Date & Time\", that your iPhone is showing the correct \"Time Zone\"  You can either have the iPhone determine this automatically (by turning on the \"Set Automatically\" switch) or you can set it for a specific location.  Do note that in order for this to set itself automatically you need to have location services enables as well.  \nThe next thing I would check is \"Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar\" and make sure in the \"Calendar\" section that you've enabled \"Time Zone Support\".\nAll of this is covered in this Appple knowledge base article: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4576\nHope this helps. Good luck!\n\nA: Time and Time zones.\nThere are 3 time/date settings\nOne is you device time/date, that should always represent the actual time in the place you are currently residing that is automatically updated by your phone service provider. \nThe Calender has 2 time zone settings.\nOne is for the Calender, and the other one is for the Events.\nThe Events are dependent from the geographical location they are in and your location wrt the event.\nLets take the England vs Italy match today.\nBrazil time it starts at 18:00 and for Central European time that would be 23:00.\nIf you do not travel to Brazil to watch the game:\nSet your Event as follows:\n\nYou will notice the Calender will Automatically cover the Brazilian time to your Time zone (Paris).\n\n", "Q: Is it true that all cameras of all generations of iPhone can have photo + video geotagging?

If I start iPhoto while my iPhone is connected via USB, iPhoto simply freezes, showing the beach ball all time. The only way to revive it is to kill the iPhoto process via the task manager and then to launch it again. iPhoto works ok when the phone is not connected.\nI run Mavericks 10.9.3 on a 2013 MacBook Pro Retina 13\" and the phone is an iPhone 5 with IOS 7.1.1. \nEdit 1: iPhoto is version 9.5.1\nEdit 2: The behavior is the same when I connect my iPad\nEdit 3: Deleting the iPhoto library does not change the behavior in any way\nEdit 4: Deleting iPhoto, the photo-library and everything under ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iPhoto/ does not solve the issue\nEdit 5: Reinstallation of iTunes has no effect\nEdit 6: Loading the photos works perfectly from the Image Capture app\n\nA: How many photos are on your camera roll?\niPhoto is dynamically loading all the photos on you iPhone/iPad into your MacBook's memory. This is more-or-less the same thing as loading lots of very big picture files off a USB flash drive, so don't be surprised if it takes a (some times very) long time for large camera rolls. To be sure it hasn't choked on the huge number of files you have, open activity monitor or type top in a terminal window. You'll see a list of (almost) all the tasks currently running on your system. So long as iPhoto is taking a semi-significant amount of CPU time (it takes about 10% at idle on my 15-inch MBP), the process isn't hung and you're fine.\n\nA: If agentroadkill's answer does not satisfy you, try this…\n\n\n*\n\n*First off, change the app to open when an iOS device connects to OS X's default (Image Capture).\n\n*Second, track iPhoto's external files with AppZapper. In AppZapper, [Left click] on iPhoto and [Right click] on each of its files to open a Finder window to their location. And manually nuke 'em all.\n\n*Third, do the same for Aperture, if installed.\n\n*Fourth, try removing your entire iTunes library.\n\n*Fifth, shut your Mac down (uncheck the box that asks if you want to reopen the apps).\n\n*Sixth, restart your Mac.\n\n*Seventh, if this did not work and you don't want to reinstall OS X, do it again and reset your Mac's RAMs (though I don't see how this could be of any help).\n\n\nBut if all fails, you can still use the good ol' fashioned way and reinstall OS X…   Good luck with that.\n\nA: After upgrading to Yosemite everything seems to work again. I guess the reason for the problems I had will remain hidden for all time :)\n", "Q: Deleting photos that have been backed up iCloud If I delete a photo from my camera roll after backing up on iCloud, will the backup (In this case, the photo I deleted) be affected? \n\nA: Yes, it could be gone over a period of time as more backups are made and you're forced to delete older backups (or if you remove Camera Roll from the backup selection). The next time the iCloud backup happens, it will create a backup without this photo. The older iCloud backup with the photo will continue to remain for as long as you have space available on iCloud and you don't delete old backups.\nTo view the available iCloud backups for your device, go to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage.\nNote that iCloud backup happens  automatically over Wi-Fi every day (only once every 24 hours) while it’s turned on, locked, and connected to a power source. You can also trigger it manually from Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Back Up Now.\n", "Q: Cannot open Super Crate Box After downloading Super Crate Box from the website www.supercratebox.com, the following dialog box appears when I try to open it.\nUsing OS X 10.9.3 on a 2013 MacBook Air.

Free memory decreases by time and inactive memory increases with the same amount and others don't change much. If I continue using -esp. reading-, free memory comes below to 100MB and then increases a bit -I think it starts paging =other applications' memories= to system disk-, then continues to decrease. Closing the application -that use the external- do not relese memory from inactive to free but ejecting the external does. After unplugging and trying to use the other applications, I face very sluggish performance so that rebooting becomes a better-fast choice. Both NTFS and FAT partitions produce the same result and I don't have any other partition.\nIf I try to re-read the same file after the external drive stops spinning (sleeps), it does not start spinning but trying to read another file makes it start spining. This makes me think about some -overdone- caching problem, but don't know what causes it and how to turn it off (Tuxero's caching is already disabled in the preferences, although I think it is only for writing only).\nI made some research and found nothing specific; they tell to reinstall the os or format the drive -to HFS+ -.

I have a 1st generation iPad and when I download apps it tells me “this requires iOS 6.0 or later” but when I go to update it tells me it's fully updated? Why is this happening, and is there any way I can fix it?\n\nA: The latest iOS version your system supports is iOS 5.1.1. You won’t be able to update it to iOS 6.\nUnfortunately, it means you won’t be able to install any app which requires iOS 6 or higher.\n\nA: iTunes 12.7 or later makes this answer into a no - you can’t do it.\nNow that iTunes can not manage Apps, you’re not able to side load them over USB.\n\nThe only workaround for now is to install a precedent version of iTunes (see this answer) and follow the rest of this answer.\nHere's the easiest way to download apps onto an old iPhone/iPad that doesn't support downloading apps through the App Store (if you're getting an error that you need a greater software version to download):\n\n*\n\n*On your old iPhone/iPad, go to Settings -> Store -> set Apps to Off.\n\n\n*Go onto your computer (it doesn't matter if it's a PC or a Mac) and open the iTunes app. Then go to the iTunes store and download all the apps you want to be on your iPad/iPhone.\n\n\n*If the iTunes on the computer and your iPad are both signed into the same Apple ID, and the iPad is connected to the internet, then go on your iPad/iPhone to App Store -> Purchased -> tap on an individual app you want to install.\n\n\n*You'll get a message that says \"The current version requires iOS 6.1 or later, but you can download the last compatible version,\" just hit Download.\nThis method should at least allow you to have most apps on your outdated device. Most of them will work, but sometimes even once you have the app installed on your it still won't run correctly. That's just tough luck. But in my experience that's not too common; apps usually work just fine.\n\nA: As Édouard said: the latest supported iOS for your device is 5.1.1, and if an iOS application supports only newer iOS versions, then you can not install / update this application.\nYou could try to search for an similar application with the same features which supports older iOS versions.\nOr you could try to contact the software developer / company and ask for a compatible version. I did that for my favorite media application, and they included my old device as beta tester... but this is unusual.\n\nA: The how to fix it seems to be answered by the earlier posters. Here to the why:\nWhen writing a program, one can choose pretty freely how compatible it is with prior versions of iOS. However, the more compatible it is, the less it can make use of newer versions and with that new features and new devices. In some cases, tone can only make it work with an older or a newer iOS, not both. So programmers have to move forward and exclude older versions of the OS.\nWhen an app has been in the app store for longer, several versions of the app are often stored. So installation of the app on older devices works in some cases, but not necessarily always. If only your phone doesn't allow it, while others with the same phone and iOS version have no problems, there is something with your phone or your account - maybe also with your purchases. If others have the same issue, an older version may not be available out of security reasons, for lack of compatibility with newer online features or such.\n", "Q: Running Windows through SD Card or USB thumb drive I have a 13\" Macbook Air (2013) that has USB 3.0 ports and an SD card slot. I want to run Windows to play some games that are Windows only, and I didn't want to partition my main drive because it's quite small.\nI'm thinking of either using a 32 GB SD card or a USB 3.0 thumb drive. Is it possible to do either of those, and if so which way will yield in better performance? In terms of read/write speed, which one is better, and can both have the same graphics power?\n\nA: I tried this some 2 weeks ago on my retina 15\" Mac. The usb I used was Kingston HyperX 128 gb, 3.0 . It ran WinToGo which is basically windows 8. I wanted to play Battlefield 3 but the result were very poor, I actually never managed to play multiplayer because servers kicked me for being AFK :D If you want to try some less demanding games it might work, but 32gb is not enough provided Windows alone would eat some 20-25 gb. \n\nA: The company theminidrive.com is offering a 128GB windows 8 plug and play MiniDrive http://www.theminidrive.com/products/plug-and-play-windows-8-for-macbook-air\nThis Might help will be fast if the SD port hooks up to the mother board then speeds are possibly the same as usb3 and external hard drive but this little guy sits inside your macbook!\n\nA: SD card is going to be faster then USB.\nUSB3 can go around 70 Mbs R/W\nSD-cards can run >200 Mbs R/W\nSSD-drive would do >300 Mbs. R/W\nSo if the choice is USB stick or SD-card then SD wins. You can boot from it and if you want to spend more than $100 you can get the high speed SD cards.\nThe Graphics power is the same since it depends from your GPU chip set.\n", "Q: iPad2 Wifi Issues My iPad2 works if it is placed next to the Wifi router.

It seems that iTunes completely omits these characters when sorting. As an example, I have Čajkovskij (which is the Czech spelling of Tchaikovsky) among artists in my library and it is currently sorted between Adele and Alan Parsons Project, i.e. it seems that the character Č has been completely omitted while sorting and thus the artist is sorted as Ajkovskij.\nAll my ID3 tags are of version 2.3 and in Unicode, thus this should not be any encoding problem.

There's controversy over this attribute in the web development world because it's considered overbearing to force a user to open a link in a new tab when they don't want to.\nEssentially, the browser is seen as the user's property, and they have the right to decide where they want links to open. This link property has been abused many times for popup ads and, while it can be useful, it generally creates a bad user experience.\nI assume the only way around it would be to create (or find?) an extension that goes through all of the links on a page and removes the target attribute. It appears that @sayzlim has found one for you (see here).\nAs for your third example, there's no way around that other than to disable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nA: Install LinkThing by Canibos. This Safari extension lets you configure how the browser handle the links. You can then choose to open all the onsite and offsite links in current tabs.\n\nA: Drag & drop the link into the address bar :^) Wacky, but that's what I do. \nThe problem with many fancy tab extensions is that they try to have you set a complicated  policy and set of rules for modelling how tabs should behave. Instead you usually want some simple sensible defaults, and more agency and control: you want some clue what clicking a link will end up doing, and you want to be able to override that when desired.\nSafari did a great thing even early on, it didn't just show the url of the hovered link at the bottom of the window, it told you whether it will open it in the same or a new window, or download it, depending on the modifier keys you were pressing at the time.. So much more of that agency & control than other browsers at the time.\nEven today though, its still missing being able to override the link's attributes for opening in another window/tab and force using the same one. Also there's no control in whether a new tab opens to the immediate right of the current one or at the far right.\nI'd like to see a browser extension that adds those features. Firefox had a \"Open in current tab\" extension a while ago but it broke, although choosing \"Open\" from Firefox's context menu on a link seems to do it at least sometimes, although kinda voodoo since it just says \"Open\" and you don't know what's going to happen for sure.\nUPDATE: I originally lumped LinkThing in among the extensions that have rules but little immediate control, however newer versions of this seem to have lots more control than I remember.

Simply google for bypass activation lock iphone.\n\nA: Ok this problem is surprisingly common, even when you block your iPhone and get it blocked after it gets stolen, the block won't last because its in another middle eastern country but if you wipe the phone they will not be able to get your data back. So yes the data is gone but your phone is being used but I'm very sure the person cannot see you photos or contacts etc... because you have erased the device.\n", "Q: Nothing happens on calling ruby If I type in terminal ruby it just gets stuck, nothing happens.\nWhen I type which ruby it outputs /usr/bin/ruby.\nHow do I restore ruby on my mac?\n\nA: Because ruby command tries to execute some script after ruby should be file_name.rb.\nYou're trying to execute nothing and ruby hangs.\nThere are two solutions for your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*$ ruby file_name.rb to execute ruby program\n\n*$irb to open interactive ruby console\n\n", "Q: How to type a NORMAL tilde sign (~) in Mac? I have switched to macOS recently. The only thing that's disturbing me now is the missing the tilde sign (~). The closest thing I achieved to this sign is the accent tilde (˜). This accent tilde won't work with my current passwords.\nI'm using a U.S International PC keyboard layout.\nHow do I make the tilde sign work on my Mac?\n\nA: On a Finnish Mac keyboard layout (probably applies to some other international keyboard layouts as well) the tilde can be produced with the key with the symbols ^¨. That is on the left side of Enter and below the Backspace key.\nWhen pressing Alt ^¨ and space the tilde ~ appears.\n\nA: You type the accent tilde (shift `) then space: ~\n\nA: For those readers who want to make tilde accents over characters instead of the NORMAL tilde sign (~) requested by Aborted, here is some possibly useful info:\nOptionN applies a ~ to the next a, o, or n that you type (given that you release them first). In the event that your keyboard/keyboard settings do not afford you the character,  more modified character options are available in the keyboard preferences option available from the toolbar in the upper right corner.\n\nselect \"Latin\" from the option on the left, then double click on your desired character to insert at your cursor.\n\nAnother option is the Accent Menu you get when you hold down the key for the base letter, as described by Apple here\n\nA: In the Spanish keyboard, press the Alt key down and hit \"ñ\".\n\nA: You might consider switching \"U.S. International PC layout\" to \"U.S. layout\"\n\n\nA: On my Czech keyboard when using the U.S. input source it works to use shift+\\ (button next to left shift, see the screenshot). I believe the same button is above the enter key on MacBooks from other countries.\nWhen using the Czech input source with this keyboard, ~ is gotten via Option 5 (where it is printed on the key).\n\n\n\nA: On a French, Spanish or German Mac keyboard,\ntype ⌥+N to write the ~ character then space for normal tilde or n for tilde over n.\n\nA: I just pressed all bottons and found that if you press alt + ¨ you will get ~\n\nA: The U.S International PC keyboard layout was the issue for me, as well as similar issues for other symbols (different versions of ^, and auto options for ' and \" that I didn't want). Keyboard shortcuts were ineffective with this layout too, always outputting accent hildes. Changing to the Australian keyboard worked for me, and U.S. layout works too. Other types of keyboards should work too, though based from the other answers, the output for hilde (and also for other symbols) varies across different types of keyboards.\n\nA: On my Macbook with Italian keyboard layout it works with OPTION + 5.\nThis is tilde as in \"~\", ASCII 126, that can be used for example in Linux CLI.\nOPTION + N followed by SPACE produces the diacritic tilde : \"˜\"\nThat looks similar, but it's actually smaller and shifted upwards and is not the tilde ASCII but rather Unicode 0303 combining diacritic tilde https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0303\n\nA: Try \nhold option key down and type n\nrelease option key and type n again   ñ\n\nA: Try using Shift+Page Down. I don't know Apple keyboard layout (I'm using a Hackintosh) but it works for me. \n", "Q: Putting SSH keys I've taken from Ubuntu I came over to Mac from Ubuntu.

Somehow my notification center crashed while I was typing a message and it has been broken for a couple of days now. Is there a way besides restarting my machine? (just curious, i can easily restart it but if there's a way for it to go away without restarting then I'd like that)\n\nA: Open the Activity Monitor, kill Notification Center and it'll reload automatically !\n", "Q: Run GUI Applications from Terminal with root privilege So it has been well documented that GUI applications (like gedit or textedit) should NOT be run with sudo. Ubuntu et al get gksu and gksudo (and the like) so question: what do WE (Mac users) get? Given that the Darwin kernel is built on some *BSD code, I assume the same issues apply, but how do we go around this?\n\nA: To edit /etc/hosts with Sublime Text:\nsudo /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/MacOS/Sublime\\ Text /etc/hosts\nIf you have to do this on the regular basis, you can add this snippet to your ~/.bash_profile\n#   sudoapp: Runs .app with root privileges\n#   Usage: sudoapp /Applications/Name.app /etc/hosts\n#   --------------------------------------------------------------------\n    sudoapp () {\n        sudo \"$1/Contents/MacOS/$(defaults read \"$1/Contents/Info.plist\" CFBundleExecutable)\" $2\n    }\n\nApps running with root privileges will use /private/var/root as home folder, thus all config and temporary files owned by root that will be created in the process will stay where they should be - in the root home directory.\nThis is the same as logging in as root and running the app, but without the hassle of user switching.\nThis method works on 10.6 — 10.11\nUpdate: Apple's own TextEdit refuses to start if run as root in 10.11 and newer, so I changed my example to use Sublime Text instead\n\nA: While is it possible to launch a graphical application as the root user, it is not recommended. It may work, most of the time, but avoid relying on this behaviour.\nAvoid root\nRunning an application as root is not recommended because it dramatically increases the risk of causing problems with your Mac. The use of root should be limited to the smallest possible piece of code with strict controls in-place.\nApplications are increasingly moving towards a fragmented design to avoid exposing too much power to code that does not require it.\n\n\n*\n\n*A mistake in code running with root permissions is a security risk.\n\n*A mistake in code without root permissions is much less capable of causing serious problems.\n\n\nThere are edge cases but these are increasingly rare. The introduction of sandboxing and XPC are part of Apple's efforts to reduce the need to provide excessive authority to processes running on OS X.\nCommand Line Tools\nIf you need to work with files as root user, use command line tools such as vim, emacs, or nano. These tools do not rely on the WindowServer and can happily be launched as root within another user session:\nsudo nano <path to edit>\n\nGraphical Tools\nIf you prefer graphical editors, use an editor that works with the design of Mac OS X.  BBEdit is an excellent editor that will correctly handle editing root owned files.\nWhen you edit a root owned file with BBEdit, a second process is used to bridge the permissions gap between you and the owner of the file. This process passes through Apple's sanctioned paths and thus ensures a predictable experience - hopefully across multiple major versions of Mac OS X.\nWhy? WindowServer Limits and Design Scope\nThere are subtle technical problems with launching a graphical application within another user session.\nThe underlying technical problems stem from one user wanting to launch a graphical process within another user's session. Mac OS X's WindowServer was never designed with this as a goal. User sessions are extremely difficult to break out of even as root user – all for desirable security reasons.\nApple has dramatically improved the WindowServer design in the last few major versions of Mac OS X. It is now possible to have multiple users logged into different graphical sessions on one Mac through Screen Sharing. This seemingly simple improvement relied on a huge amount of behind the scenes effort from Apple's engineers.\nHowever, Apple is unlikely to provide an easy way to cross launch applications as different users from within a single graphical user session. How would this benefit their customers?\nIf you want to explore this topic further, look for questions involving launchctl and running applications in other active user sessions.\n\nA: There are good reasons NOT to edit files as root. Why not just copy them to a temporary file, edit this and copy back.\nYou could use visudo although this requires some knowledge of vi, but is OK for making simple changes to /etc/fstab or similar.\nYou could try setting the EDITOR environment variable and running visudo although I have never tried this with a graphic editor.\n\nA: Sergei's answer didn't work for me on OS X 10.8.5 \n$ sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts\nI got a permissions error message\n\nSince sudoing the binary first, then double-clicking the file in Finder worked, I came up with the following less simple command\n$ sudo -b /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit && sleep .5 && open -a /Applications/TextEdit.app /etc/hosts\nYou can make a function of it like Sergei's, if need be.\n", "Q: Find the path to my USB webcam on OS X Mavericks I am trying to live stream my webcam (with ffmpeg) on a web server using Web sockets. However, I cannot manage to find the path (similar to /dev/video* un Linux).\nI wanted first to use iSight, but Apple makes it really complex to access it (using avfoundation, qkit).\nHow can I identify/access my Webcam device please ?\nNote : I have found this post, but sadly unanswered.\nThanks\n\nA: You should try the VLC player.\nIt has multitude of options for setting of the Capture and Streaming.\n\nI am not showing your set up since I do not have external webcam, but it should show in the drop down menu for you.\n", "Q: Terminal tool to join mp4 videos I would like to join mp4 videos like I join pdfs by pdfjoin.\nIs there any default tool to join videos?\n\nA: The first answer above didn't work for a recent version of ffmpeg, which would be 5 years now since this answer was given.\nSo in order to do a simple concatenation of video files without re-encoding them using a modern version of ffmpeg (currently 4.4.1):\nCreate a .txt file with each line containing the files you want to concatenate, and each filename needs to be preceded by the word file and the filename needs to be surrounded by tick-marks. It should end up looking like this:\nfile 'Video1.mov'\nfile 'Video2.mov'\nfile 'Video3.mov'\n\nAlso, if you're running the ffmpeg command from the same folder that your files and the text file exist in, then no need to worry about using absolute paths in the text file.\nSave that file as whatever ... I called mine files.txt.\nThen this command will join them together and put the result into a single video file:\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy VideoFinal.mov\n\nIf you need to use absolute paths in your text file, then you would OMIT the -safe 0 from the command like so:\nffmpeg -f concat -i files.txt -c copy VideoFinal.mov\n\nThis worked like a champ for me and it joined a couple of hundred megs of video in less than three seconds.\n\nA: Yes, you can join multiple videos into one file using default terminal commands. Using a simple cat will do want you want.\ncat video1.avi video2.avi videon.avi > output.avi\n\nThere is a big but here - this method will output the video1.avi header onto output.avi. Therefore, the header of output.avi is the same as video1.avi, so on most video players, it will look like video2.avi and videon.avi are lost - source 1, source 2.\nTo fix this, you need additional tools. There are many other terminal tools for joining movies that update the header as well. The most known video editing tools are mencoder (which is a part of MPlayer) and ffmpeg. Both have an enormous amount of options and settings and it is beyond this forum to go into much detail, but I will give the short commands below.\nThe use and installation of mencoder or ffmpeg can be intimidating, but the video editing capabilities are the most powerful I have encountered so far. As the installation from source can be a hassle for native OS X users, I advise you to use Homebrew.\nTo install these tools using Homebrew, run this one-liner in your terminal:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)\"\n\nHomebrew is now installed, it is wise to follow the installer's suggestions after installation. Now we install ffmpeg and mencoder using brew.\nbrew install ffmpeg mplayer\n\nNow we can use mencoder to merge the two videos:\nmencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -idx -o output.mp4 video1.mp4 video2.mp4 video3.mp4\n\nOr we can use ffmpeg to merge the two videos:\nffmpeg -i concat:\"video1.mp4|video2.mp4\" -codec copy output.mp4\n\nNote that you may need to escape the character \"|\" which is special for many shells, so\nffmpeg -i concat:video1.mp4\\|video2.mp4\n\nYou specifically ask for .mp4 files. mp4 is a container format, it is possible that the default installation of ffmpeg or mencoder does not have the correct coding/decoding ('codecs') packages by default and that you need to install these separately. But that is beyond the scope of this topic.\n", "Q: How can I list only interface name and assigned IP with ifconfig in terminal Is there a way using only ifconfig to list only network interface names and their assigned IPs?\nI am aware that I can do ifconfig | grep inet but this does not include the interface name (en0, en1 etc)\n\nA: You could run ifconfig -l to get a list of interfaces, then iterate through them.\n(bash)\nfor i in `ifconfig -l `; do echo $i; ifconfig $i | grep \"inet \" ; done\n\nThis will print the interface on one line, and the \"inet \" info on the next line.  Note that if you only search for \"inet\", the \"inet6\" line will also show up.\n\nA: Netstat vs ifconfig.\nNetstat -i is closest I can find for what you want (it does bit more then you asked).\nName  Mtu   Network       Address            Ipkts Ierrs    Opkts Oerrs  Coll\nlo0   16384 <Link#1>                          7096     0     7096     0     0\nlo0   16384 localhost   ::1                   7096     -     7096     -     -\nlo0   16384 127           localhost           7096     -     7096     -     -\nlo0   16384 localhost   fe80:1::1             7096     -     7096     -     -\ngif0* 1280  <Link#2>                             0     0        0     0     0\nstf0* 1280  <Link#3>                             0     0        0     0     0\nen0   1500  <Link#4>    14:10:9f:f0:29:8c   380920     0   292385     0     0\nen0   1500  mynet.local fe80:4::1610:9fff   380920     -   292385     -     -\nen0   1500  10.5.50/24    10.5.50.95        380920     -   292385     -     -\nen3   1500  <Link#5>    32:00:1a:e9:a9:a0        0     0        0     0     0\nbridg 1500  <Link#6>    16:10:9f:0f:1e:00        0     0        0     0     0\np2p0  2304  <Link#7>    06:10:9f:f0:29:8c        0     0        0     0     0\n\n", "Q: Using Nickname or Contact Photos in Facetime I recently inherited a broken iPad which I fixed (hooray) and I have decided to use it by putting all my kids games and apps on it, so there is less risk of my daughter accidentally messing with my work and personal apps etc. and so that I don't need to worry about her breaking my newer iPad.\nOther than her own apps with which she is familiar, I am wanting to make it easier for her to FaceTime a few people (mainly her grandparents) with ease.  To do this, I have setup a new iCloud account, and arranged it to login using that address for FaceTime/iMessage and so on.\nEverything works as expected, but my issue is that Facetime only shows contacts in the \"Firstname Lastname\" format, and does not use the nicknames that I have setup, or show any contact photos.  This makes it difficult for her to tap a name and know who she is calling, even with a tiny contacts list of 3 people.  She's not able to read properly yet, and also obviously refers to most family members as Mum, Dad, Grandma etc (which are her sort of comprehension level, she's good with M is for Mum type phonics at present), not by their real names which she simply doesn't know yet.\nI have Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Short Name > Prefer Nicknames set to on.  In iMessages I get both the photos and nickname, which is great and allows her to see who sent her a photo for example.  Can I do the same for FaceTime?\n\nA: I would try to create a Favorites list in Facetime.\nIn your Favorites, you can add or change your contacts' photos.\n\nA: Building on the previous answer, you could create contacts photos that have the preferred name as graphic text overlaying the bottom of the picture, or have a picture that is just the required text.\n", "Q: iPhone Wi-Fi could not connect I was just using my iPhone when it suddenly disconnected from Wifi. I went into the Settings app, I tapped on \"Wi-Fi\" and it froze there (only the app was frozen, I could still close it). So I closed it and tried several times until finally I went into the Wi-Fi setting. It was searching for connections but it just kept searching and didn't even show up my wifi connection. I tried resetting it by holding down the sleep button (the one used to lock/unlock iPhones) and home button simultaneously but it didn't work. I've also tried normal restart by first shutting it down and let it boot up again, problem is still there. \nI have restored my iPhone twice from my backup, and restored to factory settings and restored from backup, still the stubborn problem is there.\nSometimes it got worse till the whole iOS froze up for about 10+ seconds. Other apps work perfectly fine. Other settings in Settings app are currently accessible. \nRunning on iOS 7.1.1.\n\nA: There are a lot of possible things here that could cause your problem. \n1)The Wi-Fi receiver on your iPhone could be faulty. You will have to take it to an Apple Store to get that fixed. \n2)Your modem might have connection problems. Try pulling out the power cord and wait 5 minutes. While you're waiting, make sure all the cables are fit into the modem and not loose and hanging out.  \n\nA: If this has been going on for a long time I would recommend you take it to apple and if it's a 5 or 5s and it's in warranty they will replace it for you. Or if they conduct the tests and the problem is noticed I'm sure they will replace it.\n", "Q: Can one iPhone be registered to multiple Developer accounts?

And you would need a FW800 to 4 pin FW400 to connect to your DV camera. Then I think iMovie will be able to handle your DV camcorder.\n\nA: you can buy a av to mini usb on amazon or over google shopper from around £8 so I'm sure you will be able to transfer the data that way.\n", "Q: Menu bar still present after uninstall I have been using a Vodafone mobile broadband(modem) and decided to get rid of it then everything went wrong. I dragged the app and dropped it on to the trash but its menu bar is still there but inactive. I searched for multiple help to rectify the problem but still the menu bar was there. I used easy find to look for everything related to Vodafone and deleted it still the menu bar was there. Nothing in the PC has Vodafone related files except that its menu was present. \nGuys is there any way I could deal with this or is it a more larger problem than I thought. \n\nA: There are a few places where items can get launched, and the most common place is in System Preferences > Login > Startup Items.  That's the goto place for most issues like this.\nRemoving the Application doesn't always remove all traces, especially if the App was installed by an installation script, rather than simply being dragged into your Applications folder in the first place.  Scripted installs often perform all sorts of background installs, such as kernel extensions, and helper apps that sit in the Menu Bar, and the startup items list is the common place to fire them up.\n\nA: When this app is installed, typically it also installs a folder in Applications named \"Vodafone Utilities\", that contains one item that is called \"VMB Uninstall\", which you can use to remove it altogether. This removes the startup and the icon on the menu.\n", "Q: How can I figure out why my MacBook is crashing?

recomend following steps in trouble shooting:\nIf you start in safe mode (hold Shift during start up) that would eliminate 3d party applications doing it.\nIf no problems, then some 3rd-party thing is causing the problem. \nIf problems also in Safe mode, then most likely hardware related.  \nRun the Apple Hardware Test suite (hold D during start up), extended tests at least twice.\nUnder normal operation when Battery is weak or falsely reporting its state the system will cut the CPU power in half. That should not force the restart but it is possible.\nReset your SMC and PRAM to verify that.\nIn you logs i did not find the culprit (it is hiding well).\nFeel free to publish some 50 lines before the boot-time (enter it in the Filter window of the Console)\n", "Q: Can the Internet sharing on proxy network be tracked? In my office I have Mac Mini that is connected to an ethernet cable for internet. They don't allow us to use the office wifi on mobile etc. \nSo what I am going to do now, is create hotspot out of my Mac Mini machine for my phone's use. \nBut I want to know if it can be tracked as the office Mac is already on a proxy network. Will the IT guys come to know about it?\n\nA: Yes and yes and yes.\nThe ssid of the mac mini will be broadcast. Most offices have a couple of their access points listening for other ssids and trying to figure out if based on signal strength it's from within the office. They probably automatically email someone about it. Whether that person cares is another matter.\nThe mac being proxied has all its network traffic monitored and/or filtered. If it's NATing for your phone, that will be visible. Again, unclear on if they care. But even if they don't that proxy might be blocking several things that the only phones access, like maybe the ios app store.\nIT companies lock down networks because they have resources within them that they can't effectively lock down any other way. That is sad, but if they're limiting what devices can join the wifi that's probably why.\nIf you can configure the sharing so that each device ends up on a vpn that can only communicate externally (like to the internet) and back, then probably you'll be keeping things secure and can make a case for doing so. EG two phones connected to your wifi point shouldn't be able to talk to each other, nor to the mac, nor to any of the internal ips that the mac probably can talk to.\n", "Q: Interstitial screen/marketing layer on Airport guest wifi Is there a way I can add an interstitial screen when a user first logs in to my Airport Extreme's guest network whereby I can make a marketing ask (like, \"Like us on Facebook!\") and require them to check a box and click a button (\"I accept the terms of service,\" etc.) before continuing to browse the web?\n\nA: What you're looking for is a Captive Portal.\nYou can't create captive portals solely with an AirPort Extreme—you need at least a computer behind the network set up as DCHP/DNS/etc. You're going to need to configure a Mac to provide DNS to redirect the first visit from a device to a hosted site.\nFor more information about creating a captive portal yourself, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://brewstersoft.com/blog/setting-up-a-captive-portal.html\nCommercial software is available which can set this up for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://patronsoft.com/firstspot/\n\nA: your looking to do something like what the Wavespot (router) does, its a social wifi authentication gateway that allows people to sign into a wifi network using email or Facebook 'Like' (or twitter or Google Plus). Good service and we use it for a few of our agency (bluntagency.com) clients, predominantly shopping centre's.\n", "Q: Are you using a Sharp PN-K321 at 60Hz with a Late 2013 Mac Pro? According to Apple's KBase article on \"Using 4K displays\", the Sharp PN-K321 monitor is supported at 60Hz in MST mode if you're connected via mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort.\nI've ordered a StarTech mDP-DP cable as Amazon's comments indicate that it works well (or well enough), just wondering if anyone has any experience with this or similar products.\nNamely, do you have problems waking the Mac Pro from sleep?  Does the display properly wake up?  Do you notice any flickering or lag using Photoshop or any other 2D or 3D applications?\nThe Pro is already updated to OS X 10.9.3; haven't checked yet whether the Sharp display is on the latest firmware (v11301118).\n\nA: The StarTech cables work perfectly, all that was required to enable 60Hz was to use the display's onscreen controls to enable MST mode.  Restart the display and voila.  \nDefinitely noticeable improvement in scrolling through large Photoshop and Illustrator files.\n", "Q: Applescript mail errorhandler I have a script to send an email, but I'd like to detect if no email account is setup, and to do something else. \nIs there a way to detect or trap for this condition?

No plugins. Incognito mode.\n\n*Open new tab or open any webpage or open a link in a new tab.\n\n\nNow if this new tab is active, it is unresponsive. After some time even Chrome lists this tab as \"This page(s) became unresponsive. Do you want to kill it?\".\nWhat is strange is that I can scroll, click on the links in this 'unresponsive' tab, but there is no feedback (page stays blank or half-loaded or fully loaded but unresponsive), but when I switch to another tab and switch back to the 'unresponsive' tab, I can see that my clicking or scrolling took place. This tab switching also fixed the unresponsiveness, i.e. after switching back the tab becomes fully operational and is fully operational (I can open many different links inside it), until I close it.\nThis happens only some of the time. Sometimes 20 times in a row, sometimes only 1 in 20 links opened. This is really really weird and I suspect some 3rd party app might be responsible for that, but I'm not sure where/how to look for the real culprit.\nIt happens both for regular Chrome and latest Canary. It has been like that for about 2-3 weeks now. I'm on latest Mac OS X.\n\nA: have you tried to deleting the chrome folder in your user's application support? I had a similar problem on my sister's computer the other day and this fixed it\n\nA: Fortunately after updating to latest Chrome Canary, the problem goes away. This means it has been a bug in the browser (that manifested istelf on my machine). Regular Google Chrome still experience it, though.\n", "Q: RAW images not supported in Aperture after Time Machine restore After restoring from a Time Machine Backup all of the RAW images in my aperture library show as \"Not supported\", even though they did work on my old laptop (where the backup was made).\nHere is what I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloading and manually installing the latest Camera RAW\n\n*Repairing permissions for my Aperture Library\n\n*Repairing the Aperture Library itself\n\n*Rebuilding the library itself\n\n\nAnd it still says \"File type not supported\"  The weird thing is after I rebuild or repair the database, the thumbnail will work, But expanding will then break it and all of the thumbnails will go back to the exclamation mark.\nI have multiple backups, one time machine and one put on a windows server.\nMy camera is supported by Digital Camera RAW - Sony Alpha SLT-A57\n\nA: It appears that this problem isn't with Aperture at all as the image files themselves are corrupt.  This isn't the solution to the problem, because this is just a side-effect of the main problem.\n", "Q: Removing Items from Reading List How do I remove items (individual or all) from Reading List on my iMac (OS X 10.6.8)?\n\nA: I'm running OS 10.9.x right now, but I don't think it should be too different. When you open the reading list by clicking the little glasses (I think that's what it was- it may be under the same book icon as bookmarks), mouseover the item you want to delete, and you should see a tiny x in a circle appear in the top left of that item. Click to delete it.\n\nA: sidebar for reading list, has a tiny x to remove that one item\ncontrol-click it to get an option for delete all\nfound on https://discussions.apple.com/message/24035730#24035730\n\nA: Hold \"control\" down as you click on reading list item.

You can delete more than one item using \"shift\" or \"command\" keys.\n\nA: hold control key, click on item, select remove.\nthat works now after update\n", "Q: Set Static IP Reservations on AirPort Extreme I am new to this, but I set up a little server for something up on a laptop connected to the Ethernet of the airport express. I had the server down for a few months and when I plugged it back in, I noticed that the local IP address had changed, and I had to change the IP on the port forwarding settings. Is there a way I can \"force\" this to be static so I don't have to change it every time the Local IP decides to change? \nThanks for any help\n\nA: According to the fourth hit on Google here, all you need to do is open get the MAC address of your server, then open AirPort Utility and select your AirPort base station and choose edit (or just click on it if you're not using version 6.0+) and choose the Network tab. Seeing as how you have different local addresses, I'm assuming you have DHCP enabled (it's always a good idea) you just need to set up an IP reservation for the MAC address of your server.\n", "Q: Will installation of macports automatically install or update OpenSSL? I am a mac user and want to stay with the system-provided version of OpenSSL, which is OpenSSL 0.9.8y. I am wondering if installation of macports will automatically update my OpenSSL or install another version?\nAlso, how can I check the version of the OpenSSL library on my mac instead of the version of the OpenSSL command? Do they always have the same version? Thanks!\n\nA: MacPorts will not replace your system-provided version of OpenSSL. If you install OpenSSL using MacPorts, it will do so in a separate prefix (by default /opt/local).\nTo check the version of the OpenSSL library, run /path/to/openssl version where /path/to/openssl is the path of the OpenSSL binary that corresponds to the library you want to check, e.g. /usr/bin/openssl for the system OpenSSL in /usr/lib/libssl.dylib and /opt/local/bin/openssl for the MacPorts OpenSSL in /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib.\nYou can also check the OpenSSL library version directly using\n$> strings /path/to/libssl.dylib | grep -E '^OpenSSL'\n\ne.g. for MacPorts:\n$> strings /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib | grep -E '^OpenSSL'\nOpenSSL 1.0.1i 6 Aug 2014\n\nand for system OpenSSL:\n$> strings /usr/lib/libssl.dylib | grep -E '^OpenSSL'\nOpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013\n\nUnfortunately OpenSSL has changed and those command don't work the ^ in the grep does not find the version so for Macports\nstrings /opt/local/lib/libssl.dylib | grep -E 'OpenSSL'\n\ngives\n!(29OpenSSL 1.1.1l  24 Aug 2021\nOPENSSL_DIR_read(&ctx, '\nOPENSSL_init_ssl\n\nand the system library has moved in Big Sur and possibly earlier\n\nA: MacPort will only install binaries you asked him to install using sudo port install.\nTo know your openSSL version, just type openssl version. \n", "Q: spinning circle next to wifi symbol when music folder open I get the spinning circle when my music app is open, it never turns off! Can this drain my battery? on brand new iPhone 5s on ios7\n\nA: See the answer to What does the spinning circle next to the network indicators on iOS mean?\n\nApps can turn on and off the indicator at will, so it's not a 100%\n  reliable indicator that data is actually being transferred.\n\nYou could make an experiment: leave the phone idle for two hours and check how much energy is consumed with the app on and off, respectively.\n\nA: As for battery drain, YES it will drain the battery, but it is not the spinning circle that does it, it is the Network data transfer going on (in your case playing music).\nApple in its Wisdom and Generosity added that information for your to know there is a network activity going on.\nThe WiFi signal only says you are connected, but says nothing about are there data been transferred.\nSo now you have the additional information telling you when data transfer is happening that:\n\n\n*\n\n*could help you managing your data plan (if you pay per use or have some sort of limit in your data plan ect.)\n\n*tell you your system might be updating some apps\n\n", "Q: Contention for M7 Motion Chip? What happens when multiple apps access the M7 motion chip? When one app reads a step count, does it zero the counter for other apps, or will other apps also be able to access the step count and double count the steps?\nFor example, I use MyFitnessPal and RunKeeper. At work today, while fairly sedentary, I enabled access to the M7 processor in MyFitnessPal. It tracked about 1500 steps. This evening, I went out for a walk and turned on RunKeeper. It logged my activity in MyFitnessPal when I was done, and the steps in MyFitnessPal dropped to zero. I lost the ~1500 steps from earlier in the day. What's going on?\n\nA: There's no contention. Apple provides APIs for accessing the M7's data and all the APIs are thread-safe. This means that there can't be any problems caused by two apps accessing the data at the same time.\nFurthermore, reading data from the M7 doesn't manipulate the data in any way. Other apps can still access the data and the data is not reset.\nAs for the cause of the specific problem in the question, I'd put it down to a bug in the app itself.\n", "Q: How to prevent MacVim from inheriting .profile as if it was Bash itself? I have this guard in my .profile:\nif [ -n \"$BASH_VERSION\" ]; then\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bashrc\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bashrc\"\n    fi\n\n    if [ -f \"$HOME/.bash_aliases\" ]; then\n        . \"$HOME/.bash_aliases\"\n    fi\nfi\n\nStill, I have verified the check is passing for MacVim started from Finder, not only from bash terminal, and .bashrc contains terminal related script that seems to make MacVim not work as expected when started by double click, so I must have this check failing for non-terminal executions. I'm not sure whether this affects MacVim only or just any application. I was expecting $BASH_VERSION empty for anything started from Finder.\nAny tips?\n\nA: There is a preference in MacVim to do this.\ndefaults write org.vim.MacVim MMLoginShell 0\n\n", "Q: Can I install OS X onto a separate external drive partition? There are plenty of articles explaining how to install OS X on a separate partition of your Mac’s internal drive and how to install it onto an external drive using a single partition. However, it’s not clear to me whether it’s possible to install OS X onto a separate partition of an external drive. It’s what I’d like to do, is it possible?\nFor what it’s worth, my external drive currently has a single 500GB partition, is formatted as “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)” and has a GUID Partition Table. That should make it bootable, right?\n\nA: Yes!\nAs the disk is the correct format, it will show in the disk list in the installer (click Show All Disks). You can install any version of OS X on a partition of the correct format, regardless of where the partition is located.\nThe OS X installer doesn't partition the disk for you though; do this first in Disk Utility.\n\nA: Macs will boot from any connected drive, even remote volumes over a network. The installer will therefore put it's product on any connected drive with a compatible file format (and offer to reformat it if not).\nAn 8Gb USB thumb drive is commonly used by IT departments and technicians to service a mis-behaving machine, but at that size your content is severely restricted - the techs usually don't care.\nStandard, 2.5inch external drives are painfully slow if you try to run it as a regular Mac. You won't have any \"problems\" other than poor performance. FireWire 800 is almost normal, an external Thunderbolt case will be just as fast as an internal drive.\n", "Q: Mysql Workbench Model table height issue having a weird issue with the model editor in mysql workbench.

A screen shot is the best way to describe what is happening...\n\nAs you can see the tables 'address' and 'customer' have heights in the box titles that do not suit, resizing left/right/up/down does not make a difference. Any suggestions?\n\nA: You should try upgrading to 6.3\n", "Q: Connecting iPhoto to external drive Would it be possible to create iPhoto \"repository\" on an external USB hard drive, so that every time I would plug the drive I launch iPhoto, I could manage my photos?\n\nA: If you mean an iPhoto library for storing masters/etc, you can create a second library by holding ⌥ when launching iPhoto. You can create a new library and will be prompted for a location to store it.\nIf the library is unavailable when launching iPhoto, the original library will be used again (or one created if the original library can't be found).\n", "Q: Can you save the current desktop background as an image? I've deleted a photo by mistake. I have the photos as my desktop background.

I select it and would then like to slightly edit the related URL. Instead, it only lets me editing the page title, and when pressing enter it performs a web search with the edited title. How can I change this behaviour?\nThis still applies in Safari 10.0 under macOS 10.11.6.  Pressing the right arrow key after the page title matches only takes you to the end of the page title.  The URL is displayed to the right of the cursor, but does not appear to be editable.\nHere is a screenshot of a matched page title, before pressing the right arrow key:\n\nHere is after pressing the right arrow key.  Note that further presses of the right arrow key do not affect anything.\n\n\nA: The answer might simply be: You can't.\nWhether or no this is desirable could be debated, but having worked on a couple of these things in Mozilla/Firefox days, I think it is clear that someone (aka Apple) would create a browser location opener-thingie to do it this way.\nHere's why I think this is Safari expected behavior:\nThe match you are looking is a match to a Bookmarks and History via the Title. The URL is being provided for your convenience (or if you come from a certain period of browser design and/or security orientation, its to mitigate more obvious versions of URL spoofing).

Why? I want to share my 4G connection with my laptop since our WiFi connection at home can be slow. However, once I go to the iPhone Settings > Personal Hotspot and enable the hotspot,  the iPhone asks me to enable its WiFi antenna. \nAt this stage, the iPhone automatically connects to my WiFi network at home and I cannot really transfer the 4G connection to the Hotspot. \nWhat should I do (apart from connecting the iPhone via USB to the laptop)?\nMore importantly, why do I loose the 4G connection and connect to the WiFi network instead of the iPhone being smarter and procuring my 4G connection? \nThis has happened in the past very rarely and I could always enable 4G iPhone hotspot over WiFi. Now the problem happens each time I accept the prompt to connect to WiFi.\n\nA: Try turning off your home WiFi. A kind of interference, maybe?\n\nA: Sounds like its auto connecting to the home network - known networks are joined automatically when you turn on your iPhones wifi so you need to click the \"i\" next to the network name in your iPhones wireless network settings and select \"forget this network' to stop that occurring?\n\nA: This clearly isn't how the hotspot is designed to work. Have you tested for corrupt preference files on iOS by backing up the device and restoring it as a new device?\nAt that point, you can test the cellular hotspot without ever joining the home WiFi in the first place and verify the carrier side is working with your hardware. If and only when that works, then connect to WiFi and repeat the test with tethering.\nAt that point, you will have narrowed down and verified the hardware works and the cellular plan works and the firmware / carrier settings are all set. You can then either set up the phone as you wish or restore the backup knowing the status of the hotspot feature.\n\nA: Call your cellular contract provider because sometimes they do block the hotspot feature, i.e. if you live in the uk a company called gif gaf allows unlimited data and have not blocked the personal hotspot function on the iPhone, however if you use it they may cancel your contract.\nhope that helps\n\nA: (excluding bluetooth) iOS forces you to use WiFi [set to ON] when you turn your hotspot ON.  This is super crappy since [in my case] the WiFi picks up the available office wifi connection which blocks a lot of content (like FB).  The only way you get around it is forgetting the network, in which case you lose all of your settings...OR use bluetooth.  Unfortunately 1) Bluetooth is slow; and 2) if you have a hard [network] connection to your docking station, the Bluetooth connection assumes a lower position...so my laptop still routes through the company network.  In other words, I have to take my laptop off the docking station to use bluetooth at all.\nNow here's the rub with Apple...  I have a 2nd phone with uses the Android OS on a Samsung and with that, I can have the hotspot ON and the wifi turned OFF...thereby allowing my laptop to connect via wifi to my phone but using cellular data instead of the company wifi.\n", "Q: Restoring selected iOS apps and data to my new iPhone I made a full backup of my old iPhone 4S (iOS 7.1) with iTunes. I'd like to restore only some of the apps and app data to my new 5s from the iTunes backup. Is this possible?\nI don't need much of the apps figuring in the iTunes backup just a few games along with their scores which were saved off my old iphone. Thx in advance.\n\nA: Update: apart from iCloud selective app backup which implies that you need to fully restore the new iphone, you can use this to back up and restore only selected apps and app preferences that go along. \nOtherwise create another backup of your old iphone, this time via using iCloud. (Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage). From the options on the next screen, choose which and app data you want to back up exactly. Then hit \"Back Up Now\". \n\nUpon restore to your new iphone only the app data you selected during the icloud backup will be restored.\n\nA: Even though this is an older post with a marked answer, I still want to address the question since this page ranks highly in search engines and it's a problem I've been actively working on.\nHere's a link to a blog post I wrote about a tool I made for \"filtering\" a backup made in iTunes so it only contains the data you want to keep: https://deciphertools.com/blog/selective-iphone-backup/ We started the tool because people wanted to transfer Apple Watch Activity data without restoring an entire backup, and it's grown up from there.\nYou can filter by app, keeping data for only some apps, as the original poster wanted :)\n", "Q: Dollar sign in mdfind shell command I'm a newbie in shell scripting.

What's the use of the dollar sign?\nmdfind $'kMDItemFSName=\"*iValet\\'s*\"c'\n\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSName=\"*iValet\\'s*\"c'\n\n\nA: A dollar sign before a single-quoted string is just another type of string, but it allows C-like escape characters, like \\n and \\'. \nIt was used in the command you mentioned because it contains an escape for the single quote—normal single quoted strings do not allow any escapes at all, including escapes of the '. Backslashes are interpreted literally. So by using $'…' it avoided escaping the double quotes, and allowed the string to have a ' in it. \nThere is some more information on this type of string quoting here on the Bash Hackers Wiki.\n", "Q: OSX Messages shows contact accounts as invalid I had Messages.app when I got my mac a year and a half ago and it worked great.\nHowever, since a few weeks ago all my contacts in my previous conversations appear in red (as if they do not have an account). \nWhat's even more curious is that I can see when people are actually typing (I see the 3 dots (dis)appearing), but I only get the message on my iDevices. \nSolutions I have already tried : \n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting messages\n\n*Signing out/in my account\n\n*Rebooting\n\n\nI am now out of solutions, do you guy have any ideas what the problem might be?\nNB : My OSX is up-to-date with 10.9.3\nEdit : It also doesn't work on my iPad (iPhone is still OK, receiving iMessages as iMessages).\nEdit2:  I hoped updating to Yosemite would help.

See also the discussion here.\nWhat resolved the issue was activating the iMessage Setting on my iPhone via Settings > Messages.\nStrangely this does effect the Messages send/receive on the Mac as well!\nCan you verify this?\n\nA: Try checking your internet connection? If you have Wifi you would most likely use it for your Mac and iPad, but your iPhone would use mobile data (if you have it.) Also if you are using your work's internet connection the IT department may have blocked access to the iMessage servers. Alternatively, check with your ISP to see if they\n\n\n*\n\n*have blocked access to iMessage servers or\n\n*can verify anybody else having the same issue.\n\n\nA: What actually solved my problem was : disabling iMessage on a computer where my account was logged in (a Mac with Mountain Lion). \nBefore that, I had already disabled (and re-enabled) my iMessage account on every other device. \nI'm pretty confident about the fact that it solved my problem because it was the last one where it was enabled. I've read many times that disabling-enable on EVERY device may solve the problem. So if this doesn't work, think HARD there might be one last device (Friend's mac, siblings' iPod etc).  \n", "Q: How do I load the DiskManagement framework in single user mode?

It works great on my iPad and iPhone, and I would like to be able to see both the iCloud Calendar and my Google Calendar at one page on my PC (Win 7).\n\nA: You need to \"subscribe\" to the iCloud calendar from your Google calendar.\nIn iCloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Share button to the right of the calendar you want to share, then select Public Calendar.\n\n*Click Email Link.\n\n*Type your Gmail addresses in the To field, then click Send.\n\nIn Google:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy and paste the link from the email you receive into Google’s “Add by URL” field in the “Other Calendars” section.\n\n*It can and most often WILL take up to 24 hours for events from the subscribed calendar to display in Google.\n\n\nA: The web interface for iCloud only shows iCloud calendars. As far as I can tell it can't display Google calendars, as the Calendar apps can. If you want to see both iCloud and Google calendars on the same web page, then I must ask, why do you need two different calendar services? I personally only use Google calendars, which the Calendar apps on my Mac, iPad and iPhone are perfectly capable of using (with Siri!) without iCloud. You could also choose to use only iCloud calendars, for the same effect, the only difference being which web app you use when you're on your PC.\nIf you insist on using both services, though, these instructions could probably be used to configure the Google calendar web app to display iCloud calendar info through iCloud's CalDAV interface.\n", "Q: Do I really need to replace my MacBook Pro? I have an early 2011 (8.2) MBP (i7@2.0Ghz) which I've upgraded to 16Gig memory and 512 Gig SSD.\nI am a heavy CPU and IO user: vagrant, Vmware Fusion, external display, Office, various IDE's (Xcode, Eclipse derivatives for Scala, Ruby,Java), IntelliJ, Webstorm, databases - Postgres, Mongo, MySQL.

This reduces the stress on the GPU and improves cooling: use a (very small) magnet to make the macbook think that the lid is closed. See my answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/110535/34825\n\n*You can disable the CPU turbo boost. One easy way is using this utility: http://www.rugarciap.com/turbo-boost-switcher-for-os-x/\nAlso, make sure you have trim configured on your SSD.\n\nA: You know that your computer is as fast (hardware) as it was originally.\nWe know it is you who demands more and more.\nSo you have the: Core i7” processor (2635QM)\nIntel has made a nice tool for you to see what are you doing to the CPU. It even has a log function.\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20\nI recommend you use it to observe how is your CPU suffering.\nAlso your Activity monitor will tell you that.\nWhy do that?\nWell, it will help you making the decision if you are using 100% all the time or are there a breather periods (as observed by your fans cycles up and down. Nobody knows you better and your habits the you.\nWhile talking about the Fans: All of your MBP is super high tech, the cooling technology is still prehistoric.\n\nWe basically use grease as heat transfer media, and a large metal block for heat dissipation, and then we use rotating blades to move the air around. Dyson has made rotator free fans (no noise) but they do not fit in to your MBP. \nThe Microprocessor technology is trying to reduce the heat generate by the CPU using designs and technologies (dynamic thermal management ect..)  but that only goes as far. Good example is the Haswell CPU on MBA, it has much reduced power consumption (longer battery life, less heat) while delivering equal or better computing power.\nSo when do you get newer hardware.\nLook at this: Next-gen faster Haswells chips out as soon as next month, could find their way into upgraded MacBook and iMacs.\n\nThat is next generation Haswell-refresh (core i7-4790). So it is better then the one in MacBook Air and it will stay cooler (less power consuption.

I'm not sure it worthing it because it's the same processor architecture. The only way to reduce heating a little is to buy a CPU with higher frequency (+ $500).\nSo spending $3.000 to save your ear may not be the best thing to do... Maybe working with music in order to cover the sound of the fan will make you save a lot of money\n\nA: Short answer: No\nI was in the same situation as you. A laptop (not just a mac) is not really designed to be used under such heavy load for extended periods of time. With Macbooks getting smaller, there is precious little ventilation available now. This means that the fans will kick in even under minor sustained CPU load.\nUnless you really MUST run everything on a laptop I would STRONGLY suggest that you get yourself a desktop; that's what I did.\n", "Q: Messages.app not responding My Messages decided to stop responding.\nComplete lockout.\nThe only way to kill it is in the Activity Monitor with Force Quit.\nIt consumes 100% of the CPU and is not responsive. \n\nThe Force Quit generates a long report to be send to Apple (done that).\nSomehow I do not expect Apple to respond to me, but some of you here might.\nThe Console report shows this:\n6/17/14 20:07:50.000 kernel[0]: process Messages[6475] thread 409143 caught burning CPU!

(For this reason, it’s unnecessary to have your catalog entries scan deep into the contents, but that’s an option if you want.)\n", "Q: Virtual Hosts Not Working on OSX Mavericks In Mac OS X 10.9.3 I've Included http-vhosts in httpd.conf\n# Virtual hosts\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\nI've commented out the DocumentRoot and the Directory in httpd.conf\n# DocumentRoot \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\"\n# <Directory \"/Library/WebServer/Documents\">...</Directory>\n\nI've added the following to my httpd-vhosts.conf file\n<VirtualHost *.80>\n    DocumentRoot /Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen\n    ServerName local.rocket-gen.com\n    <Directory \"/Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen\">\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order allow,deny\n        Allow from all\n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nAnd I've added the following to my /etc/hosts file\n127.0.0.1    local.rocket-gen.com\n\nI've restarted Apache\nsudo apachectl restart\n\nThere is an index.html in that directory but when I access http://local.rocket-gen.com from the browser I get a 404. I am getting this in the error logs\n[Tue Jun 17 19:09:10 2014] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: /usr/htdocs\n\nI can't figure out why it is not working. If I create that directory as the DocumentRoot in httpd.conf it works. But I need to have several Virtual Hosts, so I'd like to get the vhosts file to work.\n\nA: It looks like you have nearly everything correct. I'm running Mavericks with a couple dozen virtual hosts, so this should work for you. \nFirst, and this might be all you need to do to fix things, you need to enclose your DocumentRoot in quotes. So, \nDocumentRoot /Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen\n\nbecomes  \nDocumentRoot \"/Users/gdboling/Sites/rocket-gen\"\n\nNext, add the following to your /etc/hosts file, on the line immediately following what you already have. Your hosts file should be: \nYou have this part:\n127.0.0.1    local.rocket-gen.com\n\nNow add this right below:\n::1     local.rocket-gen.com\n\nI have each of my vhosts set in hosts this way. \n\nA: Obviously, your apache cannot find its defined document root. In my opinion you mix some things up.\nFirst, correct the typo within the VirtualHost container. You define addressing a port with a colon, not a \".\"\n<VirtualHost *:80>...</VirtualHost>\n\nSecond, if you want to host multiple servers by name and not by IP address, you need to use name-based virtual hosts.\nThen of course in Apache configuration you missed the NameVirtualHost directive, if you want to set it up this way. \nNameVirtualHost server1.example.org:80\n\n(http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/name-based.html)\nALWAYS set the ServerName, otherwise apache cannot chdir to your new documentroot.\nThird, in the main httpd.conf configuration part you commented out the DocumentRoot. Did you also do this with the access rules in the \"Directory /\" section for your former DocumentRoot?\nFourth, if you want to set up hard VirtualHost instead of NameVirtualHost, do not forget the Listen directive. So for that you need a\nListen *:80\n\nin your main httpd.conf. If you want to setup different servers on different IP addresses, you need to configure them like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*add IP Address and resolvable name in /etc/hosts\n\n*add \"Listen server1.example.com:80\" in main httpd.conf\n\n*refer to your server instance like <VirtualHost server1.example.com:80>...\n\n*ALWAYS set the ServerName\n\n\nA: This happened to me when I upgraded to Mavericks (10.9.5).  Apple seems to have removed the “Web Sharing” from the “System Preferences” app, which was important to the way the http.conf file was written.\nTwo ways to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start apache with WEBSHARING_ON defined:\n\n\n\napachectl -k start -D WEBSHARING_ON\n\n\n\n*Edit the http.conf file to remove <IfDefine WEBSHARING_ON> and corresponding </IfDefine>, BUT NOT the contents between the tags.\n\n", "Q: Mail.app refuses to set accounts online This started happening recently (not sure if it was since the last Mavericks update but I think so). I have two IMAP accounts and one SMTP account.\nMail.app seems to get stuck in offline mode if there is any network hiccup, and it refuses to go back online. The only way I can get mail to be sent or received is to quit Mail.app and open it again, and it works great until the next network hiccup.\nOther network operations work fine (Safari, Chrome, ssh, etc.) -- it's just Mail.app that exhibits this behaviour.\nHas anyone seen this before, or does anyone have any comments on additional things to check to help troubleshoot the issue?\n\nA: What causes mail to go offline is authentication errors.  You must contact whomever is in charge of your mail authentication servers and ask them to resolve the issue. At my work mail going offline is almost considered normal due to the fact that our internet access must pass through our network proxies which often cause mail connections to fail authentication.\n\nA: This continues to be a problem for me and apparently many others up to and including with 10.13.4, and even with very reliable internet connectivity and servers.\nTurn off \"Automatically manage connection settings\" for both incoming and outgoing servers on all accounts.

I have a standard Google account setup in my Mail, Contacts, Calendars settings (Exchange is not available to me). Also, my Gmail is set as my default account. \nNote, my contacts are synced from Gmail to my iPhone, but not in reverse; meaning, any contact I add on my phone never makes in into my Gmail contacts. I'd like to not have to do this manually or through iTunes.\n\nA: Check your default contacts account on your iPhone by tapping through Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Next, under the CONTACTS section, tap on \"Default Account\". Finally, tap your Gmail account from the list. \nNow every new contact you create on the iPhone will automatically push to your Gmail account.\n\nA: New contacts go to iCloud account in iOS by default, but when I select ONLY the Gmail contact group in the Mail app new contacts appear in Gmail.\niPhone 5S, iOS 8.1.3\n", "Q: How can I set a user-specific environment variable that includes a space character? I'd like to add an environment variable for a specific account where the variable has a space. It seems that editing .bash_profile like below doesn't work:\nexport ENV_VAR=“/Applications/Android Studio.app“\n\nand neither does:\nexport ENV_VAR=“/Applications/Android\\ Studio.app“\n\nI'm having to settle with changing the name of the application package, which isn't preferable.\n\nA: export ENV_VAR=\"/Applications/Android Studio.app\" should set the variable properly, but it's likely the program/script that uses the variable doesn't quote it properly. If if you can figure out what's using the variable, it might be possible to fix the script/program.\nMy first guess would be that the environment variable is used by a shell script that does something like:\nsomecommand $ENV_VAR/subdir/filename\n\nThe problem occurs because the shell will expand the variable, then perform word splitting -- that is, it will split /Applications/Android Studio.app/subdir/filename into two arguments: /Applications/Android and Studio.app/subdir/filename. Note that embedding escapes or quotes in the variable value doesn't do anything useful, because the shell processes quotes and escapes before performing variable substitutions. Thus, if you used export ENV_VAR=\"/Applications/Android\\ Studio.app\", it would be split into /Applications/Android\\ and Studio.app/subdir/filename; if you used export ENV_VAR=\"'/Applications/Android Studio.app'\" it would be split into '/Applications/Android and Studio.app/subdir/filename'.\nThe solution is to put double-quotes around the variable reference, like this:\nsomecommand \"$ENV_VAR/subdir/filename\"\n\nwhich tells the shell not to perform word splitting after substitution, removing the problem.\nNote that it's also possible that it's something other than a shell script, or a shell script that's doing something more complicated like using the variable to construct another variable, and possibly depending on word splitting when that variable is used.  Fixing this sort of usage can get messy.\n", "Q: Cannot re-install OS X Lion after trying to format Macbook Pro I have been facing an issue regarding a OS X Lion installation in my Macbook Pro 13. I used to have OS X Lion, then I decided to update my O.S to the OS X Mavericks; the update was pretty good, it was successful. \nThe problem was when I tried to \"format\" my Mac, during the re-installation of the O.S, a message appeared in my screen saying that the \"Recovery partition could not be created\", that was weird for me, I am not very good with my Mac yet, so I tried using a OS X Lion installer (which is in a CD), I tried to install from the CD (what many people call a \"clean installation\") but I got the same result regarding the \"partition recovery\".\nI saw that some of the people mention that it is needed to delete all the partitions created, but in my case, every time I try to delete any of the partitions, it says \"cannot unmount disk\", and I am not able to perform any deletion over the partitions as mentioned in many tutorials.\nSo far, I noticed that a yellow alert appears in one of the partitions before pick a drive for the installation:\n\nAdditionally, this is what I have when I open disk utility:\n\nI tried deleting the partitions using the disk utility and even using the Terminal commands (with sudo) but I always get the same error: The disk cannot be unmounted.\nPlease if somebody could help me, I will really appreciate, I've been without my Mac for more than 3 weeks. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: When you're booted from the CD and looking at Disk Utility, you need to use the Erase tab, not the Partition tab.  The EFI and Recovery partitions are hidden from view, so even if you delete all the partitions on the disk, it still won't delete that one.\nIf that still doesn't work, then you can open up a terminal window, and issue the following command:\ndiskutil zeroDisk /dev/disk0\n\nThat will zero out your entire hard drive, including all your partition tables.  But it could take 2-3 hours depending how fast your hard drive is.  Once it's done, you can create a new partition and install the OS.\nIf course, if you're really pedantic like me, you'd remove all media from the optical drive and USB ports, zero the hard drive, power off, zap the PRAM, reset the SMC, and then boot from Internet Recovery to do the OS install.  That's factory fresh right there, my friend.  The only thing it won't have after all that is the new computer smell.\n\nA: It sounds like you are trying to rollback from Mavericks to Lion.\nYour reasons are yours but the \"Recovery partition could not be created\" should not be the one.\nIf that is your problem then reinstall Mavericks using the cmd-r during start up, it is Mavericks that creates the Recovery partition on your hard drive. That partition is hidden partition. \nIf you want to do it your self (or it does not work) then follow those instruction (or other sources) how to install recovery partition.\nIf you still want to roll back see instructions here @ apple.stackexchange (or other sources).\n\nA: Go to a friend using a similar mac..

If so, where?\nOf course I'm ready to open the bottom cover of the computer to physically see the battery (and most likely to detach the battery from the Air to see the number on it).\nI have Macbook Air 2011 13\".\n\nA: To get access to the serial # on the battery you would have to take the MBA apart?\nIf you want to do that here are the instructions.\nIt is easier to use the About This Mac.\n\nA: The battery serial number is written physically on the bottom of the battery:\n\nAlso, in order to ensure at the official repair store that the battery is genuine (which was originally my purpose), the same serial number is on the box the battery comes in:\n\n...and also in the official papers accompanying the repair part.\nOf course, both the box and the battery inside of the box should be sealed and opened for you only just before the replacement operation.\n", "Q: Using iPhoto with an already existing folder I have a pretty big (~60G) already existing folder of photos residing in /Users/ME/OndeDrive/Pictures . I want to be able to use iPhotos with that folder without (a) changing its structure, (b) creating copies of all the files (which is what is done if I do \"Import to library\"). Is this possible?\n\nA: You can create a referenced library.\nHold ⌥ when launching iPhoto and choose Create New, then select a location for storing the library. This library won't hold the masters but will hold versions and metadata.\nUpon opening this library, go to Preferences → Advanced and uncheck Copy items to the iPhoto library. This will make any new imported photos stay in their original location and only be referenced in the library.\n", "Q: How To Disable OS X Mavericks USB autorun After inserting USB 3G modem i always getting same behavior:\nif bundled software is not installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Opening finder window with mounted folder\n\n*Opening standard installer dialog (agree license, install software that written inside 3G modem)\n\n\nif installed already:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modem-related app is launching\n\n\nQuestion: how to disable that \"autorun\" (not exactly windows-style autorun, i know)?\nSuper-annoying\nP.S. Things applied only to OS X Maverick, previous OSX versions don't show same behavior\nUPDATE\n\n\n*\n\n*Modem brand is HUAWEI E173\n\n*Previous OSX version don't show same behavior\n\n*Found hidden modem helper, location: /Library/StartupItems/HWNetMgr\nplist:\n{\n  Description     = \"HWNetMgr\";\n  Provides        = (\"HWNetMgr\");\n  OrderPreference = \"Early\";\n  Messages =\n  {\n    start = \"Starting Huawei HWNetMgr\";\n    stop  = \"Stopping Huawei HWNetMgr\";\n  };\n}\n\nAnd removed it completely && rebooted. Results: nothing actually changed. Same behavior as mentioned above. So i thinking it's not related to the modem brand/bundle and in-system property.\n\nA: You need to remove the auto launch job with the launchctl command.\nFor example, in my case I have already installed a modem manufactured by ZTE. So I searched for LAUNCHD listings using the launchctl list command and grepped for those modem strings.\nlaunchctl list | grep -i zte\n\nShowing:\n5681    -   cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist\n\nIf you do not find your app, then output all the jobs to a file. This awk command tries to overcome the chance that you may have spaces in your launchd job name.\nlaunchctl list 2>/dev/null | awk '\n{ x=\"\\\"\"substr($0, match($0, $3), 100)\"\\\"\"; print x; system(\"launchctl list \" x) }\n' > launchList.txt\n\nOpen launchList.txt. The name of the launchd job will be shown in \"...\" above the {} block where you hopefully find a \"Mobile Partner\" or \"AutoOpen\" string. \nPerhaps inspect the item to be more confident before removal. Surround by \"\" if there are spaces in the job name.\nlaunchctl list \"cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist\"\n\nThen just remove it. This is the command to stop the auto load. Be very sure you are removing the correct agent or deamon. \nlaunchctl remove \"cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist\"\n\nAdd it again if you want, using the full path of the PLIST file.\nlaunchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/cn.com.zte.usbswapper.plist\n\n\nA: The modem sofware may have a hidden \"helper\" application that launches on user login. This helper application would wait for the USB modem to be inserted and launch the modem software upon insertion.  \nCheck your LoginItems in System Preferences > Users & Groups > User > LoginItems.  \n(I would have made the above info a comment/question but my rep score only allows answers not comments...) \n\nA: You'll want to check in either:\n/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\nThis is where software will install its background daemons.  Once you find the plist associated with the vender/software, move the plist file out and reboot.  With any luck, that should be it.\n\nA: You should remove /Library/StartupItems/HWPortDetect and HWNetMgr, and you might want to delete them from launchctl too.\n\nA: Delete /Library/LaunchAgents/HWPortCfg.plist and /Library/StartupItems/HWPortDetect and reboot your system.\n", "Q: Can I develop apps on an iPhone 5 without service? The company I am working for wants to develop iPhone apps. But we don't want to have to pay for service on the phone. Is is possible to purchase a used phone and use it to develop apps without hooking it up to a provider? There is an older post about this, but I wanted to check and see if anything has changed in the last two years with doing this.\nAre there any special considerations when doing this?\n\nA: There should be no issue with this, the iPhone would just act as an iPod you would just have to install the app with a USB cable or over Wi-Fi if you choose to put it on the App Store.\n\nA: First, you don't need an iPhone to start developing iPhone apps. Xcode has a simulator.\nWhen you get to the point of wanting to test on an actual device, you do not need carrier service. \nHowever, you will need to activate the device. Ensure that the phone that you purchase is unlocked so that you can activate it with any SIM card. \nAlso, ensure that the device that you purchase is not signed in to an iCloud account.\n\nA: You might need a SIM card in the phone from a supported carrier. The card does not actually have to be activated, but I am pretty sure the phone checks for its presence when you do the initial setup.\nYou can get 'empty' SIM cards at the Apple Store. At least you can here in Canada.\n", "Q: Why are iMessages appearing on my iPad but not coming through on my phone? I think I have everything set up correctly but randomly this week I have had a few messages appear on my iPad and they have never come through on my iPhone. So I didn't even knew I had a message until I looked at the iPad.\nAlso, I have noticed that not all my iMessages are showing on my iPad. Can anyone help? Does this has to do with my iCloud backup? I am not great with all of this!\n\nA: I had the same problem.  Looking at Settings > Messages > Send & Receive on both iPad and iPhone, my telephone number was listed under 'You can be reached by iMessage at' on both and was greyed out on the iPhone, but ticked on the iPad.\nThe fix was to:\n(a) tap the telephone number on the Settings page of the iPad (Settings > Messages > Send & Receive > You can be reached by iMessage).  This removed the tick beside the number, and\n(b) on the iPhone, disabled and re-enabled iMessage (Settings > Messages), and then enabled the telephone number (Settings > Messages > Send & Receive, and tapped the telephone number on You can be reached by iMessage at settings page.\nA notification was then shown on the iPad: \n\nYour Apple ID and phone number are now being used for iMessage on a\n  new iPhone.\n\n\nA: I recommend that you first turn iMessage off, then back on.

That action will move the email from its current location (online) to your hard drive.\n\nA: Outlook 2011 for Mac has no native archive function built in.  At my office we use two different methods.\nMethod 1:\nPurchase OEAO and follow it's instructions.  This is basically an app that can automatically launch at or after a set time each day then automatically move email older than (or whatever rule) X amount of days from your mailbox to local \"On my Computer\" folders in Outlook.  This is very handy if you have a hard time remembering to move older emails or, if you're like the majority of our users, have dozens (or more) of folders in your mailbox.\nMethod 2:\nThis is the free method but it lacks the automatic archiving of OEAO.  The gist of it is that you're exporting your entire mailbox (inbox, sent, etc) and reimporting it to create a perfect archive that you can manually add to over time.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose File > Export\n\n*Choose \"Outlook for Mac Data File (.olm)\"\n\n*Select the item types (we typically just select Mail) and continue\n\n*You'll be asked if you want to delete everything after exporting.  We choose no but you might choose yes, this is a personal preference.\n\n*Specify the location and name of the exported file and click Save.  Outlook will often freeze while doing this, however even though it's unresponsive it IS actually working.  Be patient during this step.\n\n*Once the export process is complete, click on File > Import.\n\n*Choose Outlook Data File (.pst or .olm).\n\n*Select Outlook for Mac Data File (.olm).\n\n*Find the file that you created in step 5 and click Import.  Again, this step will seem unresponsive until it completes.\n\n*Click Done once Outlook finishes importing.\n\n*Expand the \"On my Computer\" section in the left of Outlook and verify that your mail folders are there.\n\n*Once you're sure that the email has been copied over to the \"On my Computer\" section you can now safely remove however many old emails as you desire.\n\n*Going forward, you can drag/drop emails from your main mailboxes to the corresponding mailboxes in \"On my Computer\" to copy them to your local archive.  Be sure to go back and then delete them from your main mailbox to free up space in your account.\n\n\nIf the On My Computer directory does not show up on the left panel, click Outlook on the menu, select Preferences, select General under Personal Settings, and uncheck the box for Hide On My Computer folders.\nAs always, please leave feedback for Microsoft about features such as this that you wish to see in future versions of Outlook for Mac.\n\nA: Our office was facing issues due to frequent switching between Macs and the PCs. Our team is badly dependent on Outlook for almost every bit. The cross-platform migrations was not only time-consuming but also often led to loss of emails. \nWe tried Mail Backup X for easy transferring between OS platforms. It offered free trial for first 15 days and in the free trial version, we were discovering a new feature, every day. We backed up windows exported mails on Mac. We tried on distributed backup, mirror backup, backup on an external drive, on google drive, almost everything. \nIts been a part of our team since then.\nIt backs up IMAP clients directly, picks up mails from the Outlook database automatically to the configurd locations.\na must tool if you are dependent on mails. we took the free trial from here:http://www.mailbackupx.com/download.html\n", "Q: Can the Mac Mini Support a 4K Monitor? I'm assembling my workplace and I'm looking into Mac Mini MD387LL along with some 4k monitor like this one, Samsung 28-inch UHD.\nProblem is that I'm not sure if the Mac Mini will support this humongous 4k resolution. Does anyone has rock solid information on that?\n\nA: I can confirm 100% that you CAN in fact get 3840x2160 @30Hz 4K from a Late 2012 mini running 10.10.5 using only one MDP to DP cable. I'm writing this using a 2012 Mac mini (Intel HD4000 internal graphics card + 8G ram) with Dell P2815Q 4K monitor. How I achieved this: 1) Used Mini Displayport to Displayport cable that came with the monitor - MDP/thunderbolt from Mac Mini to DP on display. 2) Ran the Mac Pixel Clock Patch for Yosemite: https://code.google.com/p/mac-pixel-clock-patch/source/clones  3) Downloaded and configured SwitchResX, set the resolution, saved and rebooted. Hope the info helps. Enjoy! \n\nA: MD387LL has Intel HD Graphics 4000, which uses DisplayPort 1.1, with 8 Gbps maximum throughput. In theory, this could support 4k resolution at 30 Hz (Edit: or maybe not, see comment below) but in practice 4k support generally requires 15 Gbps.\nSo the answer is: unless you write your own graphics driver, 2560x1600 is the highest you can go.\n\nA: Did 4k on mac mini late 2009. The strange problem anohter monitor had to be connected to make icons bigger to fit the 4k, this was solved to connecting two cables to the same 4k screen, and on the screen select the port providing 4k. :) Best mini computer I ever owned back then.\n\nA: In fact if your mac mini support multi-monitor configuration (i.e. 2 monitors) and allows spanning your desktop then you can archive 4k@60Hz using 2 hdmi cables. Samsung UHD has 2 hdmi ports and it supports PBP mode (http://www.samsung.com/hk_en/support/skp/faq/1061869). Samsung UHD monitor emulates 2 monitors (picture-by-picture mode) with resolution (1920x2160). As a result one hdmi cable is resposible for left part of the picture, anoher for the right part. I have not tried this on mac but yesterday tested it on PC, going to test on mac on Monday.\n", "Q: Account limit reached when attempting to create a new Apple ID I am trying to create a new Apple ID and now it's telling me: \"account limit reached\"\n\nA: If you reset your iPad, in the open dialogue boxes, skip the apple id sign in.

Spotlight has a quirk that I want to fix, if possible.

I want to be able to blacklist certain filetypes while preserving the \"Documents\" category.\nFor example, typing \"sharing\" will return the top hit as \"sharing.qml\" from the Qt5.1.1 directory, followed by Sharing in System Preferences. I can't then immediately press enter to open \"Sharing\" without first pressing the down arrow.\n\n\nWhat I am able to do to fix this individual issue is blacklist the Qt5.1.1 examples directory. \n\nYou can see that it returns \"sharing.html\" from the gtk-doc directory now.

Based on input data into our server, we expect certain output from the server. I've manually calculated and generated expected output from this same set of input to compare against what the server is generating.\nWhat I want to do is compare all of my results against what the server generated and highlight the cells that don't match. I'm using Conditional Formatting to do this, however, I can't figure out what to do within the Conditional Formatting feature to compare values from column XYZ with values from column ABC and highlight the cells in XYZ where they don't match. The number of values in both columns are the same so we can compare without fearing comparing 123 against an empty cell.\nEDIT: Thanks for the answers thus far.  What I'm trying to do is match results line by line so it should look something like the attached screenshot.\n\n\nA: You need to use a rule with a formula to determine the format. Select the column of data, and assuming the top cell in the selection is A1, create a new conditional format with a formula and enter\n=iserror(match(A1,$Z$1:$Z$1000,0))\n\nNote that there are no $ signs around the A1 reference! Then select a format and apply this conditional format to A1:A1000.\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Match() function tries to find the value of cell A1 in the range Z1:Z1000.\n\n*If there is a match, the function will return a number. If there is no match, the function will return an error.\n\n*The outer ISError() function will return TRUE if the Match returns an error and the conditional format will be applied.\n\n\nBy not using $ signs, the conditional format can be applied to a whole range in column A and will always evaluate the current row.\nSay your values are in column B and start in B3, you would need to select cell B3 and enterB3 instead of A1 into the formula.\nHere is a screenshot of a data sample where the conditional format is applied to column A, checking column C for matching values anywhere in C2 to C11, not just on the same row. \n\n\nA: Here is a simple one which will require you to \n\n\n*\n\n*Add one more column next to the comparison value column.  \n\n*In this new column write a simple formula for comparison - as shown in following image.\n\n*Add conditional formatting rule and you will be all set\n\n\n\n\n\nA: This can be done with a very simple formula in Conditional Formatting. The Conditional Formatting formula you want is: \n=NOT(EXACT(A2,B2))\n\nEXACT compares the two cells to determine if they are the same and returns TRUE if they are, FALSE if they are not. Conditional formatting applies only to cells that are TRUE, so NOT gives you the opposite; a TRUE when EXACT comes up FALSE.\n\nA: Select second column (X) and use the following formula:\n=$A2<>$X2\n\n", "Q: Licensing around running VMWare ESX on a mac mini hosting multiple OS X guests The OS X Mavericks EULA grants the rights\n\nB. \n  Mac App Store License\n...\n(iii) to install, use and run up to two (2) additional copies or instances of the Apple Software within virtual operating system environments on each Mac Computer you own or control that is already running the Apple Software, for purposes of: (a) software development; (b) testing during software development; (c) using OS X Server; or (d) personal, non-commercial use.\n\nBy my reading, this implies that I can't use VMWare ESX as the base-level OS hosting OS X guests, as then it wouldn't be \"already running the Apple Software\". However, VMWare definitely support running OS X as a guest under VMWare ESX. Presumably VMWare wouldn't support something that violates the OS X EULA, or they would have continued the support for OS X guests running under VMware workstation on windows that they had for a short time.\nHow does this add up?\nAlso, If we assume that it is OK, what happens if I want to run 3 or 4 guest copies of OS X on my mac mini? The EULA implies that it's not, however the EULA also contains this clause\n\nC.\n  Volume or Maintenance License.\n  If you obtained the Apple Software under a volume or maintenance license program with Apple, the terms of your volume or maintenance license will determine the number of copies of the Apple Software you are permitted to download, install, use and run on Apple-branded computers you own or control. Except as agreed to in writing by Apple, all other terms and conditions of this License shall apply to your use of the Apple Software obtained under a volume or maintenance license\n\nThis seems like it would provide a solution to both of the above, but I can't figure out if it's possible to purchase a \"Volume or Maintenance License\" for OS X, as nothing I've been able to find on their website has any information related to it.\nThanks\n\nA: The OS X EULA does allow for OS X to be virtualized on Apple hardware as both host and guest.  This is why (as you note) VMware Workstation does not support OS X virtualization, but Fusion, ESXi, and vSphere do.  All versions of VMware's apps check to ensure that you are running on Apple hardware and you are running a supported OS (as not all versions of OS X allow virtualization).  \nApple doesn't make it easy to purchase a Volume License.  You either need to buy it directly from Apple (it's not on their website, you have to call them) or through a third-party reseller.  \nYou are completely correct that the EULAs are unclear about the question of running 3+ OS X VMs on a single OS X host.  This is a legal question, and not a technical one.  For that matter, so is the limitation about which versions of OS X can be virtualized (ex: 10.6 virtualization requires the Server edition, and all VMware applications block you from virtualizing the Standard edition).  If the EULA were clear that you could not virtualize 3+ OS X VMs, or if Apple had said anything to VMware about it, VMware could limit you to 2 OS X guests per OS X host.\nIf virtualizing OS X is your goal, you should talk with someone who is in Apple Enterprise Sales about what you want to do.  EULA questions really can't be answered in any meaningful way by anyone else.  \n\nA: I was talking with someone from Enterprise Sales who said this was only supported on Apple Hardware. This is frankly pathetic on an enterprise front.\nOn our ESX hardware we run Windows Server, Windows Desktop, Unix and Linux boxes.\nIt allows true cloud type functionality - we don't care what the underlying hardware is and have the ability to dynamically shift devices across to other hardware without the end user being aware - fantastic for Disaster Recovery scenarios. I'm quite disappointed in Apples enterprise level offerings, it is clunky, backwards and outdated by at least 20 years.\nWe can dynamically increase hardware requirements, and have succesfully migrated our test environment across to AWS with minimal impact - something quite impossible on OSX in Apples current mindset.\nUntil Apple address this they won't get the enterprise, they will only be regulated to small business and home use.\n", "Q: Where are the files for System Information?

That's also why you get the 37m in the terminal window title. Try setting it to something different by running:\nexport PS1=\"\\e[0;31m[\\h:\\W \\u]\\$\\e[m \"\n\nand see if that works. It should give a red (thats \\e[0;31m) prompt showing hostname (\\h), current working directory (\\W) and logged in user (\\u) inside brackets [] and the bash exit status of the previous command (\\$). Note that at the end the color is reset to the default of the session with \\e[m .\nIf the above worked, you only have to find out from which configuration file your \"bad\" PS1 comes from: look for an \"export PS1=\" line in ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, (as M K already suggested in his answer) and put in the above version.\nThere are a lot of answers around here with helpful colors codes and inputs for configuring the PS1, like this one for example. \n\nA: Firstly, look at Terminal preferences (Cmd+,)for the font, text and color settings and change them appropriately. This may not be the issue, but it could make troubleshooting easier.\nIt may be the case that you have some profile script that changes the colors. Within Terminal.app, type the following command to start bash on a clean slate (without executing any profile scripts):\nbash --noprofile --norc\n\nIf you no longer face the text visibility issue, then check all the profile scripts (some may not be present) like /etc/profile, ~/.profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, look for any ANSI escape sequences and remove those.\n", "Q: view all windows in Mavericks keyboard shortcut In Mavericks (and any other version of OSX) when pressing CMD + TAB you see the typical list of open apps to switch to.\nI just discovered that when this list is open (before releasing CMD) if you press 1 you see all the windows of currently the selected app.\n\nWhat is this feature called?\nIs it possible to use it outside of the CMD + TAB list?\n\nA: I am pretty sure this feature is called \"Application Windows\".

Neither Adblock nor Adblock Plus remove them (at least for me). \nSomeone created an extension for Google Chrome that helps deal with these things. Is there something similar for Safari? Ideally, I would like an extension that would automatically detect such overlays and hide them. However, I would equally be happy to find an AppleScript or other means of automating the dismissal of these overlays.\nPreemptive comment #1: Some people may think that clicking the \"x\" to dismiss the overlay shouldn't be a big deal. I respectfully disagree. I'm a heavy keyboard user and having to move my hand off the keyboard to a pointing device, to find and click a small \"x\", is mentally disruptive and wastes my time. (It's worth noting that the \"x\" is not in the same location on every overlay, forcing you to hunt around for it.)\nPreemptive comment #2: Some people may object that hiding such overlays would take away ad revenue from the site owners. I have sympathy for efforts to pay one's bills, and am not trying to do hurt the site owners.  I am only looking for a way to stop these devices on a voluntary per-user basis, not for everyone on the site. \n\nA: Have you tried Adblock Plus?\n\n\n*\n\n*Blocks banners, pop-ups and video ads - even on Facebook and YouTube\n\n*Unobtrusive ads aren't being blocked in order to support websites (configurable)\n\n*It's free!\n\n", "Q: how can I download ios 7 manually to be able to get my podcast app back? I am on an iPhone 3Gs with iOS 6.1.6.\nUnfortunately  my podcast app has been removed. \nNow, if I want to install it Again, I need iOS 7. However, in my setting for software it states that my software is up to date. \nHow can I manually download iOS 7 so that I can get my podcast app back?\n\nA: Unfortunately the highest supported iOS by an iPhone 3Gs is 6.1.6, you cannot do anything in that regards, the possible solution is to Jailbreak the iPhone and try to get access to Podcast application with that.\n", "Q: Prototype - iPhone screen sized Keynote Slide (Resize slide) I watched WWDC 2014 Session -223 where they explained how to make quick and interactive iOS app prototypes using keynote. As shown in the image below, they made the slide to look like iOS screen. however it wasnt explained how they did it. Is there anyway to resize slides?\n \n\nA: You can customise the size of your slides using the Custom Slide Size… option.\nAn iPhone 5's screen resolution is: 640×1136\nOther iPhone screen sizes are available on http://www.iphoneresolution.com.\n\n", "Q: Buzzing noise after reassembling iMac 20\" 2009 I changed my iMac's hard drive to a SSD, following the iFix It guide. It all worked well, but after some hours using the machine, a buzzing noise appeared in the top left corner of it.\nI read in the forums people having problems with defective PSU, but mine was working fine before disassembling the iMac. What do you think I could've made wrong in the assembling?\nThanks \n-- edit --\ncuriously, after keeping the computer some minutes unplugged, and turning it on again, the sounds disappears. It's actually working for a few hours and the noise didn't come back yet. Weird.\n\nA: The most likely cause would be the fan causing the noise. See this post from bMike 'Is it possible to install an SSD ...imac'  where he points out that \n\"..the immediate downsides - You will need special tools and be handling some delicate parts. Also, there is concern that the temperature sensing since the 2009 model iMac causes the fans to run faster with non-apple drives.\"  I have also had the problem with the fan going into overdrive and creating a horrible buzzing, so I am aware they are susceptible to this happening.  It is also possible that some foreign material got lodged around the fan, so that is worth checking too, and definitely keep an eye on the temperature.\n", "Q: How does one downgrade TextMate Bundles? Today I lost many hours of work trying to recover from a recent update to various TextMate Bundles that broke my TextMate installation (I had TextMate set to automatically update bundles, am using the current nightly build TextMate 2.0-alpha.9547 and recent changes asked /usr/bin/env for ruby18, which it didn't know).\nSo the question arises: Is there an \"easy\" way to downgrade TextMate Bundles to previous revisions?\n\nA: I'm also running Textmate 2.0 alpha.9547 so am quite interested in hearing which of the bundle updates caused the problem!\nBut to your problem, one simple way would be to restore the offending bundle from your backups.\nOn my system I find the bundles in:\n/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Managed/Bundles\n\nThe harder method would be to locate the download site for the bundle and grab an older copy.  The textmate bundle repository is at: https://github.com/textmate/\nTo find a particular bundle, just append the bundle name, including the file extension to this path.  For example, the TODO bundle source is at https://github.com/textmate/TODO.tmbundle\nFrom there you would need to clone the git repository and then use git commands to checkout the older version of the source.\nI do see that there appears to be a global change to add a \"ruby1.8 shim\" 6 days ago and bundles have been modified as you noted. I did some quick checking and I appear to be running with the same modifications and as far as I can tell so far, the bundles are working OK.\n(would have done this as a comment to the question but I don't have quite enough reputation yet.  ;)\n", "Q: Mails sent from my work gmail come back in my personal gmail I have two accounts that are hosted by Gmail. One is my personal account with a gmail domain, the other is a work account with our company's domain.\nWhen I send or reply to mail from my Mac using Apple's Mail.app, replies to those messages always go to my personal account.\nI looked in the obvious places - Accounts and Preferences. The only thing that seemed related was under the Composing preference, which was set to \"send new messages from account to selected mailbox\", which I think is the right one.\nCan anyone offer some insight?\n\nA: Ah, so this turns out to be a feature interaction issue.\nGmail always sends mail out with the address of the login of the SMTP account that sent it.\nMail will try multiple SMTP servers to send a mail if the first one fails.\nSo what was happening is that the settings for the SMTP on the work account were wrong, and the login failed. Mail silently failed over to the next server on the list, my home account. That login used my home address, so Gmail silently changed the name on the message.\nInteresting.\n\nA: Make sure it's not a error from the sender, and then contact Google. The recipient maybe replying from an ongoing conversation in which you started with your personal email and then continued with your work email, or the sender has both your work and your personal email in their contacts list and has designated your personal email as a default. There's nothing in Mac Mail that could cause this as long as you have the correct mail settings which Google would be best to provide.\n", "Q: Creating video DVD from MP4 (1,7 GB) takes ages on MacBook 13\" 2,16 GHz / 3 GB RAM Is that normal?\nI downloaded a Video (MP4 format, HD, 1.7 GB) from the Internet and wanted to burn it on DVD to watch it with our DVD Recorder.\nI used Toast 11 to create the DVD on MacOS X 10.6 and since several hours (!) it is \"coding\" the file. \nIS it normal that it takes so long to create a DVD from MP4?\nOK, the hardware is not really up to date, but can it be so slow or can I do something to make it run faster?\n\nA: I'm not a MacOS user, but this wouldn't be an abnormal amount of time on a Windows PC - it needs to fully recode the video and audio into the correct format.\nThere's no real way to speed it up, with the exceptions of upgrading the PC or downloading the video in a different format or Standard Definition.\n", "Q: Is there a hotkey to Search Wikipedia for \"x\"? This is a question about keyboard shortcuts. I think it's quite cool that you can put a word into the spotlight and one of the options is to search Wikipedia for it, but to get that functionality takes a lot of typing or mouse movement. Is there a fast way to do it?\nExample: CMD-Space opens the spotlight, I type tidal basin. About 30 files, most irrelevant appear, and at the bottom is the wikipedia search. I can use the mouse to click on it, or I can hit ctrl-n many times to get there and then return. Is there a faster way to do this?\n\nA: In the default setup for Spotlight, Search Wikipedia is the second to last option, Spotlight Preferences being the last option. You could invoke Spotlight, press Fn + -> (or End if you have a full size keyboard with that key) then up and Enter.\nVery little hand pivoting is necessary to accomplish this.\n", "Q: Is there a way to search by partial phone number in iOS 7? I'm trying to search my contacts to match a partial number (four digits) to a name. Is this possible?\n\nA: You can search your contacts by partial phone number using Spotlight.\n\n", "Q: Can't backup iphone to icloud My iphone hasn't backed up to icloud in over 19 weeks. I have deleted hundreds of pictures, turned off Mail, Reminders, Safari, Notes, and Passbook and still it says there is no room.  The only thing that is on to backup is calendar and contacts.  Can this be right? \n\nA: Please check the iCloud tab on your iPhone, you can see the details there and remove stuff you don't want anymore.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings\n\n*iCloud\n\n*Just above Delete account click storage and backup (this is probably named different)\n\n*Click manage storage\n\n*You can manage your data here and check what's taking up the space.\n\n", "Q: How do I get detailed SMART disk information on OS X (Mavericks or later) I'm trying to get a detailed SMART status report on the drives in my Mac.

This is due to SMART reading the data in/out on the drive at the moment it drops the file the SMART sensors cause the system to freeze from not being supported on a monitored system, it's not supported. If you have SMART enabled on a Mac or a Mac OS, go into disk utility and at the bottom in the disk info you will see it says, SMART not supported. Most of the MacOS I know of don't support this feature and to get a hackintosh to install most of the distro installers without your system being rejected, you must not enable this feature. I have even had Linux mint in virtualbox installed in aRAM drive say that it didn't support SMART. I will post a few pics. Every hard drive that has this feature doesn't work with MacOS very well.\n\n\n\nA: You can get quite a lot of information from the free version of SmartReporter: https://www.corecode.io/smartreporter_lite/\nDrop into Utilities and double click it. Click on icon in bar at top of screen. Right click on a disk in preferences and play with options.\n\nA: Here is a complete guide to smartmontools on osx, including where to find it, how to install it, and how to use it, by the author Benjamin von der Weiden.\n", "Q: Mac mini set to never sleep, but seems to be sleeping anyway (does not respond to network) I've enabled SSH into my mac mini (late 2012 running OS X 10.9.3), and have the energy saver settings set so that the display sleeps after 10 minutes, and the computer is set to never sleep.\nIf the mac goes unused for a while, then I try SSH into it, the SSH connection is refused. If I go bang on the keyboard or mouse to wake up the mac, then the SSH connection is accepted and it works.\nThis appears as though the mac is ignoring my energy saver settings and is in fact sleeping when it shouldn't be.\nIs there anything I can do to fix this? Is there anything to look for in console to verify if it is actually sleeping?\nThanks\n\nA: I'm going to assume you rebooted after saving those energy settings. I've had the same problem and only ever found a work-around: [caffein] (http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) will keep your computer from going to sleep (I believe later versions have the ability to let he monitor sleep while keeping the CPU itself active). This may be slightly more convenient in that you only need to click the menu bar icon to let it sleep rather than opening up energy settings all the time. \n\nA: You could open the Console.app and search all of the logs for 'sleep'. It looks like the most interesting items are from the kernel log. You will find entries that give the reason for the sleep:\n6/20/14 7:42:38.000 AM kernel[0]: Previous Sleep Cause: 5\n\nYou might also search for 'wake' to see if there is any info about why it is not waking on network activity. \nUnfortunately, Apple does not appear to publicly document what the sleep cause numbers mean. From my searches, it appears that 5 means that sleep was caused by low battery, but in looking at my own logs, I am not sure that this is accurate. \nThis pervious question explored what is know about sleep numbers but has no definative answer. \nYou might take a look at the command line pmset which allows you to control and view various power management options some of which are not directly accessible via the GUI.\n", "Q: Is there a way to sync music from more than one iTunes account to one iPod? I got an iPod Touch 4th Gen from a friend, and she left all of her music on it so I could have a larger music library. The problem is, I don't know if there is a way to sync my library with the iPod without deleting all of the music she left on it. Is there a way to sync music from more than one iTunes account onto one iPod?\n\nA: No, there is no way to do that. However, on a windows computer you can turn on \"view hidden files\" and be able to copy all of the music files in the music folder directly from the iPod to your computer. Once you've copied the files you can add them to your music library and re-synchronize the iPod.\n\nA: No, there isn't. Instead, you might want to try copying the songs from the iPod to your iTunes library using a program like Senuti, and then sync the iPod to the iTunes library. Of course, I would only advocate doing this if you have the rights to the music on the iPod *cough cough *.\n", "Q: Cannot display Macbook Pro on external projector I've looked all over the internet but I've had no luck in finding out how to properly display my Macbook Pro on an external device.

Is there any possibility to connect my iPhone to my Mac without charging the phone?  \nMy Environment:\n-  iPhone 4S (No Jailbreak)\n-  MacBook Air3,2 (Late 2010)\n\nA: After some Googling around, I don't believe this is possible. \nThough you can disable USB ports by unloading kexts, this would disable USB port functionality altogether: it would neither supply power nor read any USB connected input device (it may still supply power, but definitely would not recognize any input). \nAn alternative option would be to purchase an AC powered USB hub (for example) to reduce the power being drawn from your built in USB port when a device is connected to the hub (and hub is connected directly to AC + your machine). That way, though 500 mAh would still be allocated to the port, the iPhone would be drawing power from the AC connection. Thus, you could still connect the phone to your machine and have it recognizable via the hub without drawing power exclusively from the machine's USB port. \nRelated:\nDisable Specific USB Ports / Restrict Data Transfer from USB Ports\n\nA: iPhone WiFi Sync is exactly what you are looking for.

Like you, it goes away when I plug in the MagSafe cable. The vibrating only occurs when my MBP is on battery AND when the external monitor is connected.\nIt is NOT normal.\nMy belief is that current from the monitor is being passed into the MBP because the monitor is not earthed. I'm using a 2 prong plug on the monitor, while my MBP is using a 3 prong plug. I'm going to try and buy a new cable for my monitor with a 3 prong plug to solve this because I'm worried it's doing my MBP no good. (Currently I leave my MBP plugged into the mains when I use the external monitor, something which doesn't do the MBP battery any good either!)\nUPDATE\nWell, I bought a new cable for my external monitor with an earthed plug (or so the shopkeeper said) but it's had no effect.

I am currently using about 600gb a month and Comcast is about to start charging me for anything over 300gb. I need to find out which devices are using the most bandwidth so I can get it under control. \nThe newest airport extremes (the tower version that supports 802.11ac) do not support SNMP. Is there any other way to monitor bandwidth usage by device on my network? \n\nA: PFSense, DD-WRT/Tomato, Peplink, or some other router in front of the Apple AirPort Extreme will likely be the best solution.  Don't think there's an easier way unless you're running on a single machine for your whole network (not likely).  All the routers I mentioned support realtime traffic monitoring.  NetGear Nighthawks have this capability too.\n\nA: Comcast offers a Usage Data Meter on their website, but that has limited capability and shows only totals.\nTo continuously monitor usage by application you can use a number of 3d party apps, including:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wireshark\n\n*SurplusMeter\nTo stay away from 3d party apps use the build in tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activity Monitor on your Mac. \n\n\nwill show you usage by application and cumulative total between shutting down the network.\nIf you want to be more analytical you can use your Terminal:\nNetstat -i  will give you usefully information\nI recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the activity monitor to see what is going on\n\n*Use the Comcast to see the cumulative total between billing periods.\n\nA: You can always add a pfSense box (or other type of router / firewall) in between your LAN and your internet connection.\n", "Q: Wifi: not configured I was removing a wifi network and after removing it, my wifi icon is blank, showing a cross over it, while i hover over it which says Not Configured, I googled the problem but didn't find any solution to the problem, I tried reinstalling mavericks, while everything (user, setting and everything remain same) the problem remain same too. What can be the problem? How can I fix it? \n  and \n\nA: Rather than removing a Wi-Fi network, it appears you've removed the Wi-Fi service. In OS X prior to 10.10, this means the AirPort shows Not Configured.\nTo allow configuration of AirPort, you need to add the Wi-Fi service back to the list of services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Network and click the + button to add a service.\n\n*Select Wi-Fi as the Interface and provide a service name.\n\nThis will allow configuration through the menu bar item.\n\nA: As even after installation, your hardware is not functioning, then it certainly HS.

Recently, I've had a very frustrating problem, and it is not being able to listen to music with speaker. I'm pretty sure the speaker isn't broken because I can use it for alarms. Also, in my voice memos, the sound works although I have to click that speaker button on the top right corner so that the sound would come out of the speaker instead of the earpiece (top speaker).\nWhen listening to music, there is completely no sound, and I can't adjust the volumes. Here's a screenshot of my music.\n\nI think the problem first occurred after recording with my voice memos and syncing my phone to iTunes to transfer my recording from my phone to PC. After that, there's just no sound coming out of my phone speaker. The music works when i'm using earphones. It's still frustrating though. Any suggestions?\n\nA: The music slider grays out to indicate that it no longer has control over the volume of an output device. This is most likely because there is a volume control on your speakers that overrides the iPhone's internal volume control.\nHave you tried increasing the volume using the control on the speakers?\n", "Q: OS X keyboard shortcut precedence I'm new to Apple, and while the experience has largely been positive, I have been stymied trying to configure keyboard shortcuts to my specifications.  For example, I used a rather round-about process (via the \"Automator\") to assign a shortcut to open a new terminal.  But even now this this shortcut only seems to function if the focus is on a program which has not overwritten that particular key-combination with its own definition.  \nI'm looking for information on something like a hierarchy of protocols for how my Mac decides to use which key-combination definition in which context, or a philosophy on the best way to assign my preferred shortcuts.  Can I make a keyboard shortcut so high in priority that no application can take precedence?\n\nA: I think the OS X Human Interface Guidelines are the place you're looking for. They state that there are Apple-reserved shortcuts (e.g. cmd ⌘+space) and also “expected behaviours” (e.g. cmd ⌘+c) one should respect. \nWhile they don't explicitly state the priority, it suggests itself that the System always should have priority before the frontmost (active) and then background applications. \nFrom my experience, you’re on the safe side with multiple modifier keys (i.e. cmd ⌘+ctrl+shift+…).\nAs an aside: regarding your specific example (assigning a shortcut to open a new terminal) there's also  excellent apps for that, TotalTerminal (Terminal.app extension) and iTerm 2 (Terminal.app replacement) come to mind\n\nA: The shortcuts set in the Keyboard preference pane's Shortcuts tab take precedence over any  application shortcuts; in fact, if you dislike an application's preset shortcut or want a shortcut for a menu item that an application hasn't provided one for, you can use the \"App Shortcuts\" section to override it—though take care to copy the name from the application exactly, including, for example, three dots at the end when the menu option does as in \"Save As...\".\nFor instance, it always annoyed me when, trying to close a window with ⌘W, I slipped and hit ⌘Q, quitting my browser without a chance to save anything. So I added a new shortcut in Keyboard Shortcuts for \"Quit Google Chrome\" as ⌃⌥⇧⌘Q (ctrl-opt-shift-cmd-q). Now ⌘Q did nothing unless I held down those other modifier keys as well.\n\nA: In order to reliably override other keyboard shortcuts on OSX you have to go with an automation utility like Keyboard Maestro.  I've been using similar utilities since 1985.  \nKM is currently the most actively developed.  I use it for general automation and FastScripts for running most of my many AppleScripts.\n", "Q: MBP early 2011 EFI update I'm trying to install this EFI Update.

I connected to iTunes and restored it. I enter the language, country and connected it to my Wi-Fi network.

If you want to restore a backup, select the option for the backup that you want to restore from (iTunes or iCloud).\n", "Q: Validating AppleScript input text How would I validate this pattern: 2 digits followed by last name, basically any length of letters.

TestMy.net indicated a throughput of about 200kbps, which it suggests is 2% of the typical throughput it sees from Verizon.\nIt occurs to me just now that it could be comparing this to FiOS speed instead of other tethered network clients, but my question is: would I expect to see radically different connection speeds if I was using an iPhone 5s instead of the 4s? Is Bluetooth less capable than wi-fi tethering?\n\nA: Bluetooth is slower than WiFi but it conserves battery power.\nBT are capable up to 2 Mbps, which equals 240 KB/s, sounds like you are right on the target.\nKilobytes per second (KBps) and Megabits per second (Mbps)\nSource:\n\nBluetooth 2.1+EDR, the flavor built into all iOS devices, has a raw\n  rate of 3 Mbps and a net throughput that’s just a bit over 2 Mbps.\n  That’s fine on Verizon’s 3G network, where average speeds never top 2\n  Mbps.\n\n", "Q: Take a screenshot of the top-most window I want to have an AppleScript that takes a screenshot of the front most application.

(In general, Linux file managers allow you to specify this command line in the File info window.)\nIs there any simple way to achieve this on OS X? I've tried tinkering with AppleScript, as well as Google around for a solution, but to no avail. I probably still need to build up my Apple-technology-related knowledge and vocabulary, so as to be able to ask the right questions with the right words -- so please bear with me...\n\nA: To my knowledge, there is nothing to automatically run any script on double-script (I am most likely wrong). The best solution I've found is Automator. It's preinstalled. You want  to create a service, which will place scripts into a context menu (right-clicking on file). For your actions, you want to find the action \"Run Shell Script\". From there, you can have it receive input from Finder, such as file paths and directory paths. If you pass input to stdin, the variable you will use in the shell script is $@.\nif [[ ! -d \"$@\" ]]\nthen\n    emacsclient -c -a \"\" $@;\n    exit\nfi\n\nI do not know if that script is entirely correct, but it should put on you the right track.\n\nA: AppleScript is your friend.\nIn the AppleScript Editor, create a new script, with the following source code : \n(* This script is destined to be saved as an application droplet. It will process the items dropped onto it. *)\n\n-- This routine processes the dropped item(s)\non open theDroppedItems\n  repeat with i from 1 to the count of theDroppedItems\n    set aDroppedItem to item i of theDroppedItems\n    processItem(aDroppedItem)\n  end repeat\nend open\n\n-- This routine processes an item\non processItem(anItemToProcess)\n  set pathUnix to POSIX path of anItemToProcess\n  set pathUnixQuoted to quoted form of pathUnix\n  -- Here you make your shell command !\n  set commandToRun to \"cat \" & pathUnixQuoted\n  do shell script commandToRun\nend processItem\n\nFor the shell command, adapt the commandToRun to your desires.\nSave the script. In the Save dialog :\n\n\n*\n\n*Name the script OpenItems. \n\n*Place the script somewhere you like ; for example, you can place the script in /Applications. \n\n*Choose the format : Application. \n\n*Leave the two check boxes unticked. \n\n\nIn the source code, look at the construction on open theDroppedItems. This sort of AppleScript is called a droplet. Look at the icon of the application OpenItems you have saved. The big arrow on it shows that it is a droplet. It means that the application accepts item(s) dropped onto it.\nNow, drag-and-drop the file you want onto the application OpenItems. This will launch the command with your file. \nThe next step is associating the file(s) with the droplet. Select the file you want, and press Apple I ( ⌘ I ) to get info. In Open with, choose the application OpenItems. This will associate the file with the droplet. So, when you double-click the file, the file will be opened with the droplet OpenItems, and the shell command for the file will run. If you want this for all files of the same type, click the button Change all…\nI have tested this solution on Mavericks. It works.\n", "Q: Windows aren't quite maximized when opened When I open window in a program, I typically want it to take up my entire screen (but not be in full screen mode, just maximally sized)\nInstead, there is a thin gap at the left edge of the screen. It seems like the edge it is on follows the dock, as my dock is on the left edge, and if I move the dock to the right edge, the gap moves to the right edge. but whatever is causing this, I have to use a shortcut to remove that thin gap every time I open a window (I use a 3rd party app to make it quick but I'd still like it to \"just work\" when I open the window). Does anyone have any solutions to change this behaviour?\n\nA: As a recent Mac convert, I completely feel the pain of unmaximized windows. I get why this works for some, especially long time Mac users and never-did-Windows folks. But for me, this was a serious pain, along with all the other nuances I've been suffering through during an incredibly busy work season as well. \nI just discovered an app called GreenOrbmax, which basically reworks the green + button in a window to make it maximize, in the same manner in which I was accustomed to in Windows.\nThis might not be the solution you desire - if you find one, please post it, because I'm in. But this seems to be a reasonable solution for now, and since you didn't specify what 3rd party app you were using, I thought I'd share it with you.\nNote: it does not seem to maximize Preview windows 100%. \n", "Q: Mac collected from customer support, some settings have been reset Yesterday I collected my Macbook Pro from an authorized Apple Service Center, where they replaced some hardware components (logic board and battery-trackpad-keyboard block).\nThe SSD drive has not been replaced (according to the invoice), and it was encrypted with File Vault (OS X 10.9.3).\nAnd yet, some settings have been changed. The ones I am 100% certain about are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Accessibility settings, ignore built-in trackpad when a mouse is present.\nThis was definitely checked, but it has been disabled.\n\n*other trackpad settings: tap to click. This was enabled and it's now disabled.\n\n\nIs it because the trackpad has been replaced?\nI also did enable filevault right before bringing my mac to the service center, and I didn't really have time to notice any change then. Can these changes depend on file vault?\n\nA: Some settings in OS X are “per machine” which is mostly derermined by MAC address. Since you for a replacement logic board that address has changed so OS X is using defaults since the settings for the former logic board do not match the hardware it is currently running on.\nThis is normal and expected. Just set them again to your liking and you'll be fine.\n", "Q: How to create pkg which installs files to /usr/local I tried using Whitebox's Packages to create an installer for a LaunchDaemon. The daemon calls a shell script, which itself sources a configuration file.\nSo what I would like is an installer which installs:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/my_daemon.plist. (This is not a problem).\n\n*/usr/local/bin/myscript.sh\n\n*/usr/local/etc/myscript.conf\n\n\nI cannot find how to specify the destination path of /usr/local. \nPackages doesn't let me edit the destination of these 2 files, and seems to want to install to \"./myscript.sh\" and \"./myscript.conf\", even though it did let me define the absolute destination for the .plist file in /Library/LaunchDaemons.\nI guess I could write a postinstall script which creates the directories if needed and copies the files there. But isn't there a better/simpler solution which I am overlooking?\nIn other words, how can I create a .pkg installer which lets me specify absolute directories for some files, and which creates these directories during the install if needed.\nIs a postinstall shell script the only solution, or is there a way to have Packages do things automatically, or is there some other package-creation app which would be more practical for this?\n\nA: Rather than using a script to create /usr/local and its subfolders, include them as part of the package's payload. That is, create a prototype \"local\" folder with \"bin\" and \"etc\" subfolders, and your script and conf file in them. Set the permissions correctly (root:admin, 755 for all but the conf file, 644 or maybe 664 for that). Then create an installer package that places that whole folder structure in /usr.\nNote that if /usr/local (and some subfolders and files) already exist, the installer will simply merge your package's payload with what already exists (i.e. it does exactly what you want).\n\nA: /usr/local doesn't exist by default. You have to create it using Terminal in order to use it as a destination path. Open Terminal and enter the following command (triple click it, copy it, and paste it into your prompt). Enter your password when prompted:\nsudo mkdir /usr/local/{,bin,etc}; chmod -R 775 /usr/local/; chown -R root:admin /usr/local; exit\n\nThe first part makes the directory and sub-folders, the second modifies its permissions, and the third modifies ownership.\n", "Q: Simple deletion of files using text file list won't work I have to delete files specified by remove.txt\nwhich looks like this:\n    img_8138.dng.jpg\n    img_8140.dng.jpg\n    img_8141.dng.jpg\n    img_8143.dng.jpg\n\nI've tried several suggestions from the web:\nwhile read file; do rm \"$file\"; done < remove.txt\nxargs -rd '\\n' --arg-file=remove.txt rm -i --\nrm $(cat /Volumes/space1/remove.txt)\nxargs rm <remove.txt etc\nThe files are in the current directory some of which\nare to be deleted (remove.txt).

But using the list I get the\nerror below every time.\nrm: cannot remove ‘img_8147.dng.jpg’: No such file or directory\nAny ideas what's going wrong?\n\nA: That error is expected. There is no full path leading to the directory containing the files within remove.txt. Thus, when you run rm $(cat /Volumes/space1/remove.txt) outside of the directory these files reside in, you get that error.\nSimply run:\ncd /Volumes/space1; rm `cat remove.txt`\n\nOr modify the remove.txt file to include the full path. \n", "Q: My app was rejected citing 11.3 (In-app purchase) I created an app that lets users store items in the app. There is an amazon button next to each item.

Purchasing and currencies. One more that stands out for your situation is this:\n\n11.13 Apps that link to external mechanisms for purchases or subscriptions to be used in the App, such as a \"buy\" button that goes to a web site to purchase a digital book, will be rejected\n\nSo while you could provide a link that will open in Safari (instead of opening the page in-app), if that purchase will be used in your app in some way, it's likely to get rejected by citing this clause.\nAlso keep in mind that any interpretation here or elsewhere of single line policy statements to provide a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" to questions may not be final. It's Apple's interpretation that actually matters.\n\nA: I think that Apple wants you to “allow” users to buy items with Apple’s billing system, not with Amazon.\nWhen you have the billing, you are the king of world. This made the success of Apple’s ecosystem of apps.\n\nA: You need to create a custom API for the purchases with amazon. You can't use apple's IAP for this because they already have a default avenue for ebook sales. \n", "Q: Excluding Chrome's session storage from Time Machine Is it advisable to exclude ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Session\\ Storage/ from Time Machine backups? It certainly sounds like a prime candidate, but I am unable to find confirmation anywhere, which surprises me given that Chrome is fairly widely used.\n\nA: Since you're concerned about this occupying space unnecessarily, you could the exclude the folder. While you're at it, you could exclude the following folders since the rest (apart from Session Storage) are not useful to backup repeatedly/regularly either:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Session Storage\n  ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local Storage\n  ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Application Cache\n\nIn more recent versions of Chrome/OS X, these folders may be located in:\n/Users/$USER/Library/Caches/Google/\nNote that excluding Session Storage will prevent your sessions from being backed up - so you cannot restore back to older sessions from a backup.\nExcluding Local Storage will prevent restoring the storage used by some/many web sites that use local storage to store information (to support offline use or for longer term identification).\n", "Q: rMBP 15inch Wifi Issue I've just bought a new rMBP 15 inch a few days ago and for some reason every time it goes into sleep / powernap mode, when I turn it back on the wifi doesn't work. The odd part is the wifi still appears to be connected but I can't transfer any data, go online etc. I have to turn wifi off and on in order to get back online.\nAny ideas what's going on? I have Mavericks installed and completely up to date.\n\nA: I have exactly the same issue on my rMBP, but only with my home router. Every other router works fine, so I've put it down to the router being strange (it's a proprietary ISP router) as opposed to the Mac.\n\nA: One potential solution is that you may have static IP or DNS addresses in your WiFi setup. For me, I encountered the problem with my new rMBP when I was trying to go online outside the home (at a car shop, as it was). I had a valid network connection, but zero internet capability. It was quite frustrating. \nAs it turned out, when I migrated my settings from my MBA, the static IP and DNS addresses in that machine transferred over. I had not used the MBA outside my home, and it had been set up that way because my previous ISP provided router did not play nicely with Apple products. \nOnce I changed back to automatically assigning DHCP, the problem was resolved.

I have installed the developer preview for Yosemite.\nHuge mistake. Everything in my workspace is broken.\nI don't have any sort of backup image. I was wondering if I could re-download Mavericks and run the installer - would that effectively downgrade me back to Mavericks?\n\nA: To downgrade, boot into Internet Recovery with ⌥⌘R and select Reinstall OS X.\n\nWith regard to the original question for Yosemite Developer Previews, yes you can, but note that Yosemite DPs so far do seem to break most of the App Store. If you are still running an early Yosemite Developer Preview, you can downgrade using the Recovery HD (⌘R) as the Recovery HD was not upgraded. For later DPs, including GM and public beta, see above.\n\nA: No you cannot generally migrate everything back to a lower OS and if you attempt to run any installer that is older than the installed OS, it will error and tell you it won't even start the install. \nBut if you don't mind hand migrating documents or making a new backup (as opposed to settings and internal database files), the answer shifts to yes by erasing the new OS and starting new on the older installer.\nApple publicly explains how to erase your Mac and reinstall a lower version of OS X on the Public Yosemite Seed FAQ page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/faq\nSpecifically the part where it states:  \nWhat if I have problems running the pre-release software? :\nIf you must remove the beta software from your computer, you will need to erase, install, and restore the Time Machine backup of Mavericks that you created before you installed the OS X Yosemite Beta.

I have just upgraded from a Macbook Air (Late 2012) to a Macbook Retina (Late 2013). Now I have a 45W and a 60W charger, both MagSafe 2.\nUsing iStat Menus and Battery Health for monitoring voltages and currents, I can see that when charging my Macbook Retina with the 60W adapter, it really does draw nearly 60W from it. Using the 45W one, it draws nearly 45W. It never draws more power than the charger can deliver (I also would be very surprised if Apple would let that happen). I know that some people disagree and say this is dangerous, but for the sake of the argument let's just assume that it works like this.\nNow, Battery Health shows that my Macbook is actually charging with around 30W when using the 45W adapter (light Macbook usage, leaving around 15W for CPU, SSD and everything else) and around 45W when using the 60W charger. That means in both cases my battery is charging fine, only with different speeds.\nResearching the internet, it seems a fact for Li-Ion batteries that:\n\n\n*\n\n*High temperatures decrease battery longevity\n\n*Fast charging/discharging decreases battery longevity\n\n\nSo my assertion is:\n\nKnowing all this information, using the 45W adapter instead of the 60W one should actually help battery longevity.\n\n\nNote: \nApple officially says [1]:\n\nAlthough you should always use the proper wattage adapter for your Apple notebook, you can use an adapter of a higher wattage without issue.\n\nThey say nothing about using an adapter of a lower wattage. Which I am interpreting as: Using a lower powered adapter can work, but you might experience issues such as slow charging or no charging at all (under high macbook load). Of course Apple won't officially say that this is ok (otherwise people will complain), but if this really were a serious hazard, then they wouldn't have all the chargers designed to use the same plug.\nBut like I said, this is not what I want to discuss. What I would like to know is if my assertion is correct under the assumption that 45W chargers can be used for the MBPr.\n\nA: Since the Temperature is a major factor in Battery life degradation, slower charging is preferred.\nHowever, if you are charging while consuming /(using your computer) the charger might not provide enough to actually charge the battery and it will get depleted.\nIn that case using the lower power charging is only recommended when computer is off.\nSource 1:\nSource 2:\n", "Q: Diagnosis or Hardware Test on a mid 2009 Macbook Pro with MacOS 10.9.2 I would like to test hardware on a mac book pro model from 2009 with Mac Os X 10.9.2 installed.

The worked for me!\n\nA: What I did was to name the thumb drive “123” then to the terminal window I just renamed “Untitled” to “123” then it resolves the issue.\n\nA: For me, this worked, and got rid of the -69888 error :\n\n\n*\n\n*click the eject icon for the USB drive in Finder\n\n*click Force Eject, if prompted\n\n*physically remove the USB drive from my Macbook Pro\n\n*plug the USB back in again\n\n*immediately run the createinstallmedia in Terminal\n\n\nA: My problem and solution:    You can't create a bootable disk if your external drive is in APFS Volume format. Try right clicking your volume in Disk Utility, and Delete APFS Volume. Reformat as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\n\nA: I solved it renaming my USB cause it had the same name as the Hard Drive where the operating system was running. After that it worked perfect.\n\nA: We are dealing with 2 different problems. \nTo create a bootable USB you will need a Mavericks Installer package from Apple Store the 5.5 Gig file saved to MBA- but not run.\nI used this proces to make a bootable USB:\nBootable USB\nFormat it, using Disk Utility, as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) drive, named Mavericks. \nThis can be done from the Erase tab within the app; make sure the USB drive does not have multiple partitions (that can happen, so turn to the Partition tab to verify and correct this).\nOpen Terminal.\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Mavericks --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --no interaction.\n\n\nErasing Disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%...100%...\nCopying installer files to disk…(this part can take 30 minutes)\nCopy complete.\nMaking disk bootable...\nCopying boot files...\nCopy complete.\nDone.\n\nIf problems reoccurs get another USB stick with minimum of 8 Gig capacity (not partitioned).\n\n\n*\n\n*Second problem:\nRepairing your Hard drive:\nIf the MBP boots in the Recovery mode using cmd-r then follow that process to restore your OS installation, or use the Disk Utility to check/repair the disk.\nYou can open the terminal and use the fsck -fy to check repair the disk.\nIf the problem is minor you can start in Safe mode that will correct some minor issues.\n\nA: The problem in our case was a space after /Volumes/ in the command. That occurred when we copied the command from a website.\nSo check for spaces if you copied the command!\n\nA: For me what worked is to go to disk utility and select \"Show all devices\". The default is to show logical volumes. Then clean the actual device, get it's name, and run createinstallmedia again.\n\nA: I kept getting the error message, so I changed my USB disk name to Untitled and followed Artie Leechs instructions. Worked like a charm!\nFor me, this worked, and got rid of the -69888 error :\nclick the eject icon for the USB drive in Finder\nclick Force Eject, if prompted\nphysically remove the USB drive from my Macbook Pro\nplug the USB back in again\nimmediately run the createinstallmedia in Terminal\n\nA: I had the same problem with the macOS Monterey createinstallmedia script. The accepted answer \"make sure the USB drive is not currently used by the system or your apps\" is correct, though in my case, I had to dig a little deeper.\nIn addition to the \"Error erasing disk\" message, my USB flash drive would not eject/unmount. Sometimes Finder would hang when trying to eject, sometimes there would be a message about some program using the drive.\nTo find out which application is using the drive, use the following command in Terminal sudo lsof +D \"/Volumes/[name of drive]\".\nIn my case, it was mds and mds_stores, which are related to Spotlight indexing.\nI have no idea why Spotlight would want to index a removable device, but you can disable it in System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy. Just drag the /Volumes/[name] folder from Finder into the box.\nAfter that and a restart, I was able to create the install media.\nIf that doesn't work, you could try the following commands in Terminal (source: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-avoid-spotlight-to-read-write-to-an-external-drive.2333529/)\nmdutil -i off -d /Volumes/[name]/\nrm -r /Volumes/[name]/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V2/\n\n", "Q: When I upgraded my iPad to ios 7, I was forced to restore to factory settings.

Now I want to create a smart folder that looks in 'Images' and only lists images that were added in the last 5 minutes. When creating a smart folder, I see only the option the list files from the last day.\nHow can I create a smart folder that lists only files created in the last 5 minutes?\nIn other words, I want to create a smart folder using non-standard options.\n\nA: A 'Smart folder' is in principle a XML formatted file that, when opened, returns a Spotlight search result. To create a Smart folder you can add multiple search terms by pressing the + (or alt+). For example, you can choose to only return files that where created in the last 7 days. Although there is a profusion of search terms, some are still missing (like searching within the last 5 minutes).\nThe commandline version of Spotlight is mdfind (manual). Although harder to use, mdfind commands are more flexable than the Smart folder/Spotlight alternative. You can, for example, search for files that were created in the last 5 minutes like this:\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSCreationDate > \"$time.now(-300)\"'\n\nOr were changed in the last 10 minutes:\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSContentChangeDate > \"$time.now(-600)\"'\n\nFortunatly Smart folders support the mdfind command!

Everytime the laptop boots up, it brings up OS X Installer. The Installer never completes installation because it says the disk is damaged and cannot be repaired. \nI cannot boot into recovery mode. Probably because there isn't a recovery partition? When I hold down option on startup, the only disk that shows is OS X Installer. \nI am Windows/Linux user and not very familiar with Apple computers. What do I do to recover the data and revert everything back to normal?\n\n\nA: Fixing the MacBookPro after failed Mavericks install (HD damaged and can’t be repaired).   I decided to post this because I spent a day exploring several options in the knowledge base and I had to develop my own procedure to fix the problem.\nSummary of the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempting to install Mavericks from OSX 10.6.8 on a MacbookPro\nresulted in the following message: “The OS X upgrade couldn’t be\nstarted because the disk Macintosh HD is damaged and can’t be\nrepaired…”\n\n*Restarting computer only causes OS X installer to run again with the\nsame message \n\n*No backup available and restore partition not available\nfor OS X 10.6.8  \n\n*Disk utility from the OS X installer doesn’t allow\nrepair of the damaged disk (greyed out)\n\n\nThe solution.  Try these options in the following order (option 2 worked for me).\nOption 1: Boot from your Snow Leopard install disc and run disk utility.   Try verifying and repairing the start-up disk there.    The repair option should not be greyed out.   If it works, then restart and see if that fixes your problem (this option did not work for me after several attempts at running repair).   Since the disk cannot be verified, any attempt to create an image (.dmg) will fail with an input/output error.\nOption 2: This one worked, but took a few hours. Install OS X on an external drive, transfer information from the “damaged” disk, then install OS X back on the internal drive, and transfer the information back.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from Snow Leopard install disc (insert disc, restart and press “c”.

It seems to corrupt the internal start-up disk in such a way that disk utility can’t verify or repair it.   The data on the disk appears to be OK since a fresh install of OS X on an external drive and using the installer to transfer information from the “damaged” disk to the external drive appears to work without a problem.\n\nA: Apple has two simple articles listing the exact steps needed to fully erase your startup disk and get a clean OS installed from the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21973\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nThe first (PH21973) is shorter and to the point and the second has many helpful pictures, explanations and links to other resources. You should expect about 10 minutes to print out and read through the instructions, 10 minutes to do the wipe and an hour or so to download and reinstall the OS. If you have a very slow internet connection or Apple's servers are slammed due to it being the day of a major iOS or OS release, you might need 4 hours or more to complete the OS X download.\nAlso - some apps like iLife and iWork are not included in OS X even though they came with your Mac initially. Be sure you back them up or verify they show up as purchased apps if you don't want to have to buy them again. AppleCare can help if you can't find your purchases or need a backup.\n\nA: If your disk is damaged beyond repair, you can try the Target disk mode (needs a second Mac) to recover data from the disk.\nTrying to fix the disk:\nBoot in Single user mode\nThat will allow you to enter a disk repair command\nfsck -fy\ngood luck\n", "Q: Missing BPM information I have hundreds of songs that are missing BPM information in ITunes.

You can install coreutils (including gnu-date), then you will have a version of date that supports milliseconds.\nAs the installation from source can be a hassle for native OS X users I advise you to use Homebrew.\nTo install these tools using Homebrew run this oneliner in your terminal:\nruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nHomebrew is now installed (it is wise to follow the installer's suggestions after installation). Now we will install coreutils using brew.\nbrew install coreutils\n\nAs the installation says, all commands have been installed with the prefix 'g' (e.g. gdate, gcat, gln, etc etc). If you really need to use these commands with their normal names, you can add a \"gnubin\" directory to your PATH (~/.bash_profile) like:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\"\n\nYou can now run\ngdate +%s.%N\n\nand this will output your time since the epoch in milliseconds.\n\nA: this solution works on macOS.\nif you consider using a bash script and have python available, you could use this code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\npython -c 'from time import time; print int(round(time() * 1000))'\n\nOr write a python script directly:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nfrom time import time\nprint int(round(time() * 1000)) \n\n\nA: Perl is ubiquitous.\n$ perl -MTime::HiRes=time -e 'printf \"%.9f\\n\", time'\n1557390839.244920969\n\n\nA: In OS X, just run date +%s as OS X doesn't support any more precision than this in date's output and any excess precision not supported by the internal representation is truncated toward minus infinity.\nIf you want milliseconds output, you can use the following command, although the output is just corrected by appending zeros rather than adding precision due to the aforementioned reason. The following does output correct milliseconds on systems which support the necessary precision.\necho $(($(date +'%s * 1000 + %-N / 1000000')))\n\nSource for above command: Unix.SE – How to get milliseconds since Unix epoch\nIf you just want a command that appends the right number of zeros in OS X, you can use:\ndate +%s000\n\n", "Q: Remove SD card from iMac CD drive I stupidly inserted my SD card today into the CD drive of my iMac. I didn't see where I was putting it in. I can't even feel the SD card by using a piece of paper in the drive.\nHow do I get the SD card out as I'd rather not have to pay Apple for fixing this.\n\nA: You can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a piece of card / paper\n\n*Cut it out into an L-Shape and fold the _ of the L in half\n\n*Get somebody else to hold the computer up so that the CD drive is facing down\n\n*Put the piece of paper into the CD drive from the top and slowly, bring it down\n\n*When you reach the bottom of the drive, pull the paper out, gently and slowly.\n\n\nThe SD card should come out. You may have to do this a few times before it works - but it's better to try a few times than it is to pay Apple to fix this.\n\n\nA: I had a very difficult time removing the SD card I was trying to exteract from the CD slot - I was almost at the point of giving up and taking it in for a repair - I had tried the paper/cardboard method, reinforced with tape, and the cardboard started to rip, almost leaving ANOTHER piece of detritus in the slot - I then VERY carefully taped the section that was ripped and tried to remove the cardboard \"L\" shaped tool - it appeared to be totally stuck, and no amount of wrangling would free it.  I then tried to insert to insert (additionally) the short side of a 4x6\" index card about halfway in, and that allowed me to free the cardboard \"L\" tool. I'm guessing that it held down the \"catch\" that locks a CD in place, enabling me to free the stuck cardboard \"L\" tool.\nDeciding that paper/cardboard was not going to do it, and after trying for over 30 minutes, and not wishing to risk another tear, I fashioned a similar tool out of a very thin sheet of plastic, from a plastic folder - I wanted something thin and flexible, but nothing that might rip, and leave more debris in the drive slot.  I tried with this new plastic version for an additional 15 minutes or so.  I was also shaking the unit (\"shaken iMac syndrome\"?), and mostly trying to shake it firmly down, with the slot positioned at the bottom.  Still no luck, it seemed that the SD card had somehow become firmly lodged somehow within the drive.  I tried some more shaking, some tapping with the heel of my hand, and fishing with the plastic \"L\" tool - and eventually - Mirabile Dictu! - about 1/16\" of the corner of the SD card appeared.  I VERY (VERY!!!) carefully pinched that corner and slid it right out.  WHEW!!!  \nNeedless to say - from here on out, I will be VERY cautious about not inadvertently inserting the SD card in the wrong slot.  DOH!!!\nHope this helps someone else - be patient, keep trying - I might recommend to avoid the bent paper clip approach, so as to not cause any damage...\n\nA: If it is not that far in, you can use a paper-clip, or else get a small wire, bend it so it looks like a U and use a steady hand and a torch light to find and get the SD Card out.\n\nA: I would also suggest using a flashlight in combination with the above ideas. There are several things in the DVD drive that the memory card could get caught on if tipped on its side.\n", "Q: What are the key-names for the PressAndHold.app keyboard plists? To avoid ambiguity in this question I will use key to mean a plist-dictionary-key (look-up string); and key to mean a button on your keyboard.\n\nThis answer to another question identified a great way to edit the special characters you can insert using the press-and-hold method on your keyboard.\nYou can edit the Keyboard-xx.plist files of the PressAndHold.app to add your characters to existing press-and-hold keys. The plist dictionary keys for each press-and-holdable key look like this: <key>Roman-Accent-a</key>, and <key>Roman-Accent-A</key>, etc. but if you want to add some press-and hold characters to a number key, or a punctuation key then you need to know the key name for the dictionary in order to add it.\nI want to add press-and-hold characters for the 2 and 3 keys and possibly others, I have tried the following formats for the key names in the plist file:\n2\nNumber-2\nRoman-Accent-2\n\nNone of these add a press-and-hold popover for the 2 key. What are the correct key names for all of my keyboard keys that I can add in Keyboard-en.plist?\n\nA: I have actually the same question, but this may help someone that is trying to figure this out.\nI found here, that the name is probably Roman-Accent-2:\nhttps://github.com/skalnik/dotfiles/blob/master/osx/emoji-expansions.plist\nas this code is used:\n<key>Roman-Accent-1</key>\n<dict>\n<key>Direction</key>\n<string>right</string>\n<key>Keycaps</key>\n<string>1 1</string>\n<key>Strings</key>\n<string>1 1</string>\n</dict>\n\nAlso look up Keyboard-ja.plist, and you see that they use this Roman-Accent-x for almost any character x. But nevertheless, it doesn't work for me if I add it to Keyboard-en.plist. I don't understand why.\n", "Q: Crazy Memory usage on Transcend 128GB JetDrive 130 Expansion Card for MBA I've just received my new JetDrive Lite 130 designed for Macbook Air. When I plugged it in, I was happy to see 128GB available on the empty card. However, I copied 16GB of files to it and the Finder now tells me only 89.3GB is available. That's 39GB less space for 16GB of usage! The folder itself shows 16m bytes and 25GB on disk, whereas on my ssd, it shows 16m bytes and 16GB on disk.\nHas anyone else any experience of the same happening? I can understand some additional memory being used up, but 250%!!\nI've also heard not to reformat these cards because there are speed optimisations applied during the factory formatting. Is this true?\nI've emailed Transcend support anyway, so I'll post their response when I hear back.\n\nA: As mentioned in my original question, the SD Association (of which Transcend are a member) cite performance impacts as a reason against using standard drive formatters. \nHowever, they have a formatter available for download at https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4. On Mavericks, I reformatted my drive using this utility and recopied my files.\nThe results were as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*A single file 14.57GB took 4 minutes to copy. This is the exactly as advertised 60MB/s write speed.\n\n*80k files (16GB), however took 92 minutes to copy. which reflects about 5MB/s\n\n\nIn both cases, however, the info window was as expected showing a reasonable amount of memory usage and memory remaining. So, this solved my original problem.\nAs a comparison, I decided to reformat as a Journaled and found the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*14.57GB file took 10 minutes to copy, which is only about 50% of the advertised max speed.\n\n*80k files (16GB) more importantly took only 10.5 minutes.\n\n\nFor me, sticking with a Journaled format is a no brainer, particularly if writing lots of small files, which I will be. It also may allow me include this on a Fusion drive, although I haven't investigated this yet.\nTL;DR - It is probably best to reformat to a Journaled partition as it provides a more consistent write speed of about 30MB/s, no matter the file sizes. ExFAT ranged between 5 to 60 MB/s speeds, depending on the number of files being written (lower number is faster).\nUPDATE: Transcend replied to recommended a replacement. \n\nA: I wanted to copy my iPhoto library of about 6.7 GB to the JetDrive Lite 130 and the copying process went extremely slow after the first 50 MB or so. OS X told me, it would take 17 hours to finish the transfer. I cancelled it, did some research, found this and followed Rory's advice (i.e. reformatted with OS X's native journaled file system).\nThis time it took under 5 minutes to copy the iPhoto library. So I can't comprehend SD Association's supposed claim reformatting would cause negative performance impact.\nAnother benefit of formatting the JetDrive with OS X's native file system is that it will get included in Time Machine backups.\nThanks for sharing your experience by the way.\n", "Q: Will superdrive work on Macbook Air with Ubuntu?

I did that and again tried to sync the iPhone, but the dialog box appears every time and the syncing process gets stopped.\nIs there something up with iTunes or is the problem with the iPhone? I'm running iOS 7.1.1.\n\nA: I suspect that you have multiple purchased items from multiple Apple IDs which would explain the multiple messages. Did you authorize your PC for only a single Apple ID?

I am running one VGA display using Thunderbolt/VGA adapter from Apple and it works fine.\nTrying to connect second VGA display using HDMI/DVI adapter which comes with the mac using an additional connector DVI to VGA, but nothing happens!\nI only have VGA monitors, so question is can this be got to work in some way ?\n\nA: You cannot run VGA from the HDMI port the way you have it set up.  You need a direct HDMI->VGA converter.  The reason is that HDMI does not output analog signals.  The cable head actually has a digital-to-analog converter chip in it, but your HDMI<->DVI adapter does not.  So even though the DVI<->VGA adapter fits, the analog pins aren't actually connected.\nTechnically, the HDMI<->DVI converter you're using was manufactured incorrectly.  They should have used a DVI-D connector, but they used a DVI-I instead.  A VGA adapter will not fit onto a DVI-D connector, but a DVI-I connector will accommodate anything.\n", "Q: could you force install OSX Mavericks onto a Apple MacBook A1181 early 2008 model if running snow leopard or mountain lion osx iv just bought an Apple MacBook A1181 (white) early 2008 model and was wondering if i could install mavericks on it? in any way shape or form?\n\nA: To install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:\niMac (Mid-2007 or later)\nMacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later)\nMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later),\nMacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)\nMacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)\nMac mini (Early 2009 or later)\nMac Pro (Early 2008 or later)\nXserve (Early 2009) \n\nYour Mac also needs:\nOS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed\n2 GB or more of memory\n8 GB or more of available space\n\nThere are some attempts reported how to Force Install on non compatible models, but the result is more of a waste of time then a working computer.\n", "Q: Email verification not coming I have signed up with a .edu.pk domain and waiting for email verification, but it's been hours since I haven't gotten it.

For example I'd like to have a file \"quotes.txt\" with each line being a quotation such that I get some kind of \"Quote of the Day\" feature. \nI guess this could easily be achieved by a script running whenever the users logs off (log in would be possible as well, I suppose), that reads in a random line and sets the \"lock screen message\" string accordingly.

(But NOT disk0; that's your internal HD!)\nThen open a terminal, and type in\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/diskX  \n\n(where diskX is of course the disk identifier you got earlier.)\nType in your admin password, and it should overwrite every block of the disk with 0x00 (i.e. erase it).\nThen, you can format your drive.\n[Please be cautious when doing this; I'm not responsible for anything if anything goes wrong ;-)]\n\nI have OS X 10.6.8.\nWill you tell me if I should try this and if yes, how do I \"open a terminal\"?\n\nA: If you don't feel comfortable using Terminal you could try SDFormatter from www.sdcard.org just select SD Formatter for Mac Download and agree to the terms, it is a free app. I have successfully formatted sd cards that wouldn't mount. \n\nA: Yes, the above procedure should work, although note that there is no warnings or prevention methods against doing something wrong. Typing the wrong disk identifier could erase your internal disk. Have backups and be careful.\nTo open Terminal, go to /Applications/Utilities/ and open Terminal.app.\n", "Q: Save web page as pdf with links? Is there a way to save a web page as PDF on the Macintosh so that I can click on the links within the page to take me to the appropriate web page?\n\nA: I found out that in Safari there's a Export PDF but print to PDF also works in Safari.  However it seems that Print to PDF does not retain links in Chrome.\n", "Q: Free up over 70 GB of Applications Today I checked out my MacBook Air's storage and found that my Mac is using 70.53 GB on applications out of 120.47 GB. I can't figure out where it is being used as I didn't download any applications. How can free up my Mac's storage?\n\nA: To see the size of each application\n\n\n*\n\n*open the /Applications folder in Finder\n\n*switch to list view\n\n*make sure to have 'Size' selected in the options (Cmd-J)\n\n\nand wait a few minutes until all folder sizes are calculated by the system. Then sort by Size and remove any big apps you don't need any longer. I wouldn't recommend to delete the standard applications though.\n\nA: I suggest to use this free and opensource utility: GrandPerspective\nIt will show you graphically the disk usage. For each rectangle there is also the option \"Reveal in Finder\" (right click menu) to open directly the selected file/folder.\n\nA: I am a big fan of DaisyDisk. It provides a nice graphical view of the different types of data on your disk. It also permits you to drill down into each data type to get details, as well as delete files from within the application.\nHere's a sample of how it looks:\n\n\nA: You have applications in places other than the Applications folder.

This includes extra headers/footers that include the date, webpage, number of pages, web address, etc.\n\"Export as PDF\" is a simple snapshot of the page as is and does not include all of those extra details. \nFrom the few pages I've compared the differences with these two options, Export as PDF tends to retain more of the formatting details whereas the Save as PDF option can cause the page to look slightly different. \n\nA: Export as PDF is a Safari-specific feature.\nThe print-option is system-wide. In the case of Safari you'll also have your usual print-features that you can check or uncheck here such as printing the backgrounds as well as headers and footers\n\nA: One difference I have noticed, and it's a big one, is the page size is different in the Export as PDF rather than going to the Print and Save as PDF option.  I didn't know about this and was surprised when this happened.  It is very annoying but this is the difference I see between the two options.  Using the Save as PDF option from the PDF pulldown menu in the Print dialogue gives an A4 sized PDF if the paper size is set to A4.  Using Export As PDF gives something different, that changes according to the website thou are exporting.\n\nA: (My answer below applies to Safari 9.1.1 on Yosemite.)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Using \"Print to PDF\" will apply whatever style sheet you have activated. If you are good enough with CSS to hack your own style sheet for printing, you can get the output look as you please: you can change the page sizes (even to very custom, non-standard ones), margins, font faces, font sizes, etc.\nTo apply the CSS you want, go to:\nPreferences... => Advanced => Style Sheet => (<Other...> || <existing_sheet.css>).\n\n*For using \"Export to PDF\" I've found no way to influence the look and feel of elements on the PDF, not even page size or margins (for me it's always A4 portrait). For example, the mono font seems always to be Courier (while with the \"Print to PDF\" approach I could easily change it to Menlo, Monaco or Source Code Pro via CSS).\nThere may be a way to influence the \"Export to PDF\" outcome by using some secret defaults write com.apple.Safari ... command lines, but I've not yet explored this path.\n", "Q: uninstall camera and reinstall on iPhone I bought a new Iphone 5. back camera never worked since then. no issues with front camera. camera application also hangs now and then. I want to un install the camera app and re install it. is this possible? \nI bought the phone in America and currently using it in India. not sure if I can service it in my local Istore in India.\n\nA: You can't uninstall the Camera app as it is a built-in app. Instead, you will need to reinstall iOS by connecting the phone to iTunes over USB and clicking Restore in iTunes.\nThis also will allow you to back up the device and save your apps and content.\nLastly, Apple's warranty is worldwide and you can initiate service in the US online and via phone at http://support.apple.com and if you need a repair, they will give you options even if you are in India if it turns out to be hardware.\n", "Q: Remove OSX shortcut to switch between spaces (ctrl + number shortcut) On MacOsX Lion (upgrade from Leopard).\nWorking with some 3d application, I would like to temporarily turn off the shortcut ctrl + [numberOfSpace]. \nI went to:\n Preferences > Keyboard > Mission Control \n\nand unchecked every checkbox;\nHowever, the shortcut is still active.

I need to restore my iPhone in order for my phone's carrier unlock to go through. What is the best method to do this?\nAt the end of the restore process, I want the phone to be exactly the same as it was before the restore process (i.e. apps, app data, pictures, etc. should all be restored), without any unintended side effects (I will get to this in a moment). It's okay if minor things are different, such as having to reenter usernames and passwords, but all the apps/data must be restored.\nIt's my understanding that the simplest solution is to create an iCloud backup (assuming you have enough space), erase the phone, then restore from iCloud. Although I will have to wait for all the apps to be redownloaded, this will preserve everything on my phone, and not have any unintended side effects.\nThe problem is that I have more data on my phone than can be backed up to iCloud using the free account (5GB), so I am looking for an alternative solution.\nBy unintended side effects, I am referring to something that changes and may cause me trouble in the future. For example, if I recall correctly, when I choose to sync a phone to a particular computer, it will forever be tied with that computer, and I will not be able to sync with another one unless I erase all of the data first. I don't want this. This violates my requirement that everything be the same as it was before the restore, because now my phone is locked to a computer, a side effect I clearly didn't have before I started the restore process.\nIn your solution, please list any shortcomings and/or side effects that might arise.\n\nA: You can use a computer for backup. It only ties for that computer in regards of music and video content. If you want to sync it to another iTunes library at a later point, the music that was synced from that computer will be deleted. This is not the case for tracks bought in iTunes if that device is activated for that account, or if you're using iTunes match.\nIf you use the computer, you can choose to encrypt the backup, that way the passwords (for networks and whatnot) will be backed up and restored as well.\nAs a side note, it doesn't seem usual to me that you need to restore the phone for the unlock to take place. It usually is enough to connect it to a computer with iTunes open.\n", "Q: How to change the color scheme in KeyNote 6? In Keynote 6, each Theme comes with a color scheme. I cannot figure out where this color scheme is defined, nor how to change it.\nHow to change the color scheme?\n\nOr this one from a different template:\n\n\nA: By looking at the images you’ve posted it seams that the second palette is obtained by opening a PowerPoint presentation via Keynote: the arrangement of the dark to light shades/tints is opposite and the shades of white-grey-black at the bottom of the palette are quite different.\nI assume that you have to create a palette in PowerPoint (the so called Accent colours), save the presentation (it can contain a single blank slide) as .pptx. Then open it with Keynote and save it as .key file.\nThe original Accent colours (i.e. the last six colours that appear in the first raw of the colour palette in PowerPoint - for example when you want to change the fill colour of some shape) in the Keynote's scheme colours will be placed in the second raw. Now you have a brand new palette to work with. Just check the Master slides in the converted presentation (personally I don’t like the \"conversion\") and modify them (if necessary).\n\nA: See the description at https://monkeydogdesign.com/blog/customize-default-colors-in-keynote, it's tedious but can be done:\nStep 1\nCreate a custom palette with shades of color:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start by creating and renaming a custom palette in the color pop up box.\n\n*Add your main color to the palette. Copy and paste the hex code, or use the color sampler.\n\n*Copy the main color hex into a color tool like coolors.co that generates alternate shades.\n\n*Grab the hex codes for darker and lighter shades (use every second or third shade) and add these to your custom palette.\n\n*Name or number colors in order from dark to light.\n\n\nDon't feel like copy+pasting hex codes? Take a screenshot of the shades, and use the color sampler tool.\nYou don't have to use shades—you can use any colors you want—this is to illustrate an easy way to create shades like the default colors.\nStep 2\nAdd and fill a shape:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a shape to your slide. I'm using the mustache shape in Keynote 7.2, but you can use a simple square.\n\n*Fill the shape with a single, flat color from your palette.\n\n*Make sure the color wheel icon next to the fill setting is selected—it will be blue. \n\n*You will see the color in both boxes in the menu—to the right of Fill & under Color Fill.\n\n*Click on the top box to reveal the default color palette.\n\n*Your shape color will show up as the Current Fill, above the rest of the colors.\n\n\nStep 3\nDrag Current Fill color over default colors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click & drag the Current Fill box down to replace the default colors.\n\n*This is a finicky process—make sure the color you want to replace is highlighted by a white border before you drop your color.\n\n*If the incorrect color is replaced, just undo (⌘ + Z) and try again.\n\n\nNote: You can only have one box of each color in the default palettes. If you drag & drop the same color twice, it will simply relocated the block, rather than duplicate it.\nStep 4\nFill shape with next color and repeat:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repeat steps 2 & 3 until you've replaced all the colors you've replaced all the flat colors in your column or row. \n\n\nStep 5\nReplace default gradient fill:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your shape and choose gradient fill in the menu.\n\n*Using your color palettes, create your gradient.\n\n*Repeat step 2 & 3, dropping your current gradient fill in the default Gradient Fills row.\n\n\nThe Color and Image Fill rows will be greyed out when you drag a gradient fill.\nStep 6\nReplace default image fill:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your shape and choose image fill in the menu.\n\n*Choose your image and upload\n\n*Set the fill to Scale to Fill (stretch or original size also work).\n\n*Repeat step 3, dropping your current image fill in the default Image Fills row.\n\n\nLike with gradient, the Color and Gradient Fill rows will be greyed out when you drag an image fill.\nWhere do I find good image fills? Look for textures on a site like pexels.com. Search by color and experiment with adding 'texture' to the search.\n\nA: It's not possible to change this color scheme within Keynote. You can only define the following styles/color schemes:\n- Form styles\n- Text styles\n- Diagram styles\n- Table styles\nThe preset color schemes you mentioned are probably \"hardcoded\" somewhere in the Keynote package files. \n", "Q: Broken hard drive or operating system My MacBook Pro froze today.

After 25 years on PCs I am delighting in learning all I can about working with my new Mac and OS X Mavericks.\nI tried just now to open a zip file but was interrupted with an Archive Utility dialog:\n\nUnable to expand \"filename.zip\" into \"Downloads\".\n  (Error 2 - No such file or directory.)\n\n\nWhat to do? How can I access the contents of the zip file?\n\nA: It's likely that filename.zip is either not actually a .zip file, or is corrupted. \nOpen up Terminal. You can access it by typing \"Terminal\" into Spotlight. \nEnter the command(s) in the steps below into your command line prompt (triple click the line, copy it, and paste it into your prompt). Replace filename.zip with the actual name of the zip file. \nIf the name of the file contains spaces, you need to enter it differently using the escape \\ character. For example, if the file is named compressed crap.zip, you'd type compressed\\ crap.zip in the command line. \nStep 1:\nRepair disk permissions. Once done, attempt to open the .zip file again. If you wish, you can do this from the command line.\ndiskutil repairPermissions /\n\nStep 2:\nUse file to confirm it's actually a zip file:\nfile ~/Downloads/filename.zip\n\nThe output should be:\nZip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract \nIf you don't receive this output, post the output as a comment before proceeding.\nStep 3:\nAfter confirming it's actually a zip file, attempt to unzip it directly from the command line:\nunzip ~/Downloads/filename.zip -d ~/Downloads\n\nStep 4:\nStep 3 will likely fail. Run the zip command to attempt to repair any corruption and salvage the contents of the archive (again, replace filename.zip with actualname.zip):\nzip -FF ~/Downloads/filename.zip --out ~/Downloads/Repairedversion.zip\n\nIf it executes cleanly, you'll be directly returned to your prompt. Quit Terminal. Navigate to your Downloads folder and double click Repairedversion.zip- it should unzip without issue. \nAlternatively, it may not exit cleanly. If you're presented with \nIs this a single-disk archive?  (y/n): \nHit the y key. After you're returned to the prompt, again attempt to open Repairedversion.zip from your Downloads folder. If you're still unable to open it,  comment below with the warning(s) received from the command. If you've reached this point though, it's likely that the file is irreparably damaged.\n\nA: There are a number of things that could have happened here. The easiest way of resolving this is to re-download (or re-copy) the zip file from it's original source and re-try opening it up again. Without having more information, here's a list of possible things that could be happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*The zip \"folder\" doesn't exist. You wrote folder, but I'm assuming you meant file. What could happen is that you marked a normal, non-zip, file as a zip file by accidentally adding .zip to the end of the file name. So your computer thinks it is a zip file but it's not actually a zip file.\n\n*The destination doesn't exist. From the error message, you might not actually have a Downloads folder.\n\n\nAll of these problems are non-intuitive and the fixes for them are equally non-intuitive and technical. I think your best bet is trying to re-acquire the file again.\n\nA: Try opening the file with an app other than Archive Utility, which is the unarchiver built in to macOS.\nI used the app Keka. It too encountered an error:\n\nExtraction of \"filename.zip\" failed\n  Error code 2 using \"p7zip\"\n  Fatal error\n\nHowever it also was able to unzip a directory that contained 6 complete image files, along with a 7th failed \"Zero bytes\" image that failed extraction.\nUsing this app, or some other 3rd party unzipping app, you may be able to recover at least some of the files from the corrupted archive.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2013 hard drive upgradable? My MacBook Pro late-2011 model was recently stolen when someone broke into our car. Luckily there weren't too many other items in the car and my computer was fully backed-up.\nI am looking for a new MBP and have found several 2013 models. I am looking at a September 2013 model that shows it only comes with 256GB of flash storage. There is no way I can possibly fit even 1/4 of my documents on 256GB. I would like to reserve the flash store for OS X and other applications while having the rest of the data on another larger drive.\nI am trying to find out if this model (Sept 2013) can take an extra standard hard drive in the chassis. I had two drives in the model that was stolen.\nFollow-up: What is the newest MacBook Pro model that has a Serial ATA Hard drive connection? Also, how do Mac users with only flash based memory store large files? Do they use external storage for everything? For example, I have a large music collection and use my MacBook for video editing for websites. I wouldn't be able to do that on a 265gb PCIe flash based hard drive. \n\nA: No, it cannot. Actually, there is no there is no drive-bay at all (standard or optical). The traditional, 2.5'' 9.5mm internal notebook drives (whether SSD or HDD) that you're thinking of are not compatible (internally) with this model.\nThis is what the solid state \"drive\" looks like inside late 2013 models:\n\nAs you can see from the iFixit photo above, the SSD is really just a stick of flash memory, connected via the PCIe bus. It's made up of 8 identical NAND flash modules (in densities of either 32, 64, or 128 GB). The 256 GB drive is pictured here. There are 8 32GB chips in total, 4 on each side. The chip density corresponds to the listed drive capacity, so 8x64GB Modules = 512 GB, etc.\nThough it is possible to replace the SSD with a larger capacity one, there's currently no aftermarket upgrade available yet: \n\nUnfortunately, the proprietary PCIe 2.0-based SSD in the \"Late 2013\" models is limited to a smaller \"blade\" option, but upgrade options no doubt are forthcoming, nevertheless.\n\nSoon forthcoming, indeed.\nConsider purchasing an external storage device, or exploring 'cloud' based storage options. \n\nA: Unfortunately any MacBook Pro Apple sells right now without an optical drive will not let you install another hard drive inside the case. Your only two options right now are:\n1) Upgrade to an aftermarket hard drive that has more space.\n2) Install a large SD Card that sits flush inside your SD Card slot like this Transcend Jetdrive Lite\n\nA: The current range of MacBook Pros do not have an optical drive (which traditionally you would have taken out and replaced with a caddy to hold a second drive - SSD or Hard Disk), and even the main SSD supplied with them has a smaller footprint than a mass-market SATA SSD or HDD. This means that your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to a (much) larger third-party after-market SSD - this is not cheap, and may affect the computer's warranty.\n\n*Use an SD card or USB thumbdrive - these tend to hold less data than a 'proper' SSD.\n\n*Store your data on a networked fileserver or an external Thunderbolt/USB HDD or SSD.\n\n*Buy a MacBook Pro with the storage you require - they go up to 1TB, which sounds like about the amount of space you would need.\n\n\nA: If it's an early-2013 model, Other World Computing offers an aftermarket upgrade. Otherwise an Apple Repair Center can order any part (and therefor also a bigger SSD for any MacBook). However the so-called \"stock\" price which applies for things like these is rather high.\n\nA: Mid-2012 MacBook Pro has 2.5\" drive bay (SATA 6 Gbps), USB 3.  I have one, in the 1680 x 1050 'hi-res' screen.  Great unit.\n", "Q: Hot iPad charger wall adapter The charger that came with my iPad Air the square adapter that plugs into the socket stays warm even when nothing is connected other than that it works perfectly fine.\nI was wondering if this phenomena is normal or is not good worse yet. My biggest fear is it a fire hazard?\nWhile my iPad is connected the charger stays the same warm temperature. It doesn't get hot per se, or else I haven't noticed get too too hot but it stays warm whether I'm charging my iPad or not.\nSo what's up? Is this normal? Should I be concerned? Is is safe to leave the iPad charger plugged into the socket all the time?\n\nA: Assuming that the wall socket is providing power (or the switch for the socket is on) it is normal, or rather common, for power adapters of devices to be a bit warm when connected to the wall socket (mains) without a device connected to the other end (iPad, iPhone, laptop, etc.). In many cases, the charger would be considerably warmer while actively charging a device than when it's not.\nHere's additional information broken down into bullet points:\n\n\n*\n\n*The amount of heat produced primarily depends on the size of the adapter, its charging capacity and its build quality (there are other secondary factors as well).\n\n*Heat is a product of resistance in electrical and electronic circuits, and is observed in every electrical/electronic equipment to varying degrees.\n\n*All power adapters have a \"transformer\" that first converts the high mains AC (alternating current) voltage, which would be 230V or 110V, to a much lower voltage, which is then converted to DC (direct current) and fed to the device.\n\n*An ideal transformer and power supply would not produce heat when nothing is consuming power on the other end. But practically, all transformers (and power supplies) have losses of different kinds (although this has improved over time), and this not only results in heat, but also results in minuscule amounts of power being used even when no device is connected to the adapter.\n\n*If you find the adapter being too hot to touch, then it's malfunctioning or failing. If it's only a bit warm, there's nothing to worry about except for an increase in your electricity bills (however small).\n\n*As for fire hazard, it's always better to turn off the mains switch (or unplug if there's no switch to control it) on all electrical equipment when not in use and also keep them away from flammable items (or items that may catch fire after prolonged exposure to heat).\n\n*If the charger overheats during usage, Apple's genuine chargers have built-in protection to turn them off.\n\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wikipedia article - Real transformer - deviations from ideal\n\n*iPad charger teardown (Ken Shirriff's blog)\n\nA: Getting warm is pretty normal, as 230 Volt or 110 Volt are converted to the iPhone/ipad needs.\nOn top of that, if it's fire hazard the charger shouldn't work anymore or work very poorly, but since you didn't write that as problem you can exclude fire hazard (at this stage).\nI would recommend not leaving any charger plugged in if you're not using it (for charging purposes) at that current time. \n\nA: Testing iPad square adapter (Model A1401).\nLeft plugged-in but not connected to iPad for 12 hours.\nConsumption = 0 watts (measured by Belkin watt meter power socket).\nSo perhaps they've improved the design. But this was cold to the touch and consuming zero standby power.\n", "Q: If one forgets their iPhone Lockscreen password, how would they go about getting it back? Someone I know forgot their iPhone lockscreen password. This goes for iPhone 4 to 5. How would they go about getting back into the phone? And if they can't, can they back up data aside from the password to refill their phone after restore? What are options here? I'm an Android user myself so looking for Apple product guidance.\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no simple way of resetting the passcode without resetting the device itself.\nThe following knowledgebase article: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1212 explains how you can reset the passcode by restoring the device from a recent backup. Even if the device is locked it will still sync with iTunes which allows you to restore the device which will delete all the data on the device.\n\n", "Q: my iphone5 is shutting down and has no power to turn on what do i do? I've had my iPhone 5 for a year now but ever since iv had it it always had battery problems, i tried to replace it with a new battery but it would work for a day and the power off. Now when i try to charge it it doesn't light or display anything even charging over night doesn't put the phone on, does anyone know what i can do?\n\nA: first thing I would do is restore it back to factory one more time.  If that doesn't work, call apple and tell them, they may give you a credit, and lastly try to trade it in and get the iPhone 6 when it comes out, or if you can't wait till then, try to trade it in now.  As far as fixing the issue,it sounds like you may just have a lemon. You could tell them at an Apple store that they said this would fix it, and it isn't working, they should have given you a new phone instead of trying to replace the battery.  But next time you get a phone that's a dud, or any electronic, request a replacement, say its no good.  \n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for 3 fingers slide? I really like having applications in full screen mode and switch between them using the 3 finger swipe feature.\nBut can I have a shortcut for it? \nMaybe like command + -> , something like this?\n\nA: That would be the \n\nCtrl-Left or Right Arrow\n\nto slide between full screen applications.\n\nA: Yes. \ncontrol→ and control← do this by default.\nCheck under System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control.\n\nA: I just realised this. When working on multiple monitors, the shortcut Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow will work on the screen with the mouse pointer in it. \nFor example, if my mouse pointer is on the Mac screen, the shortcut will switch full screen apps opened on my Mac not on the externally connected monitor. This despite my keyboard cursor being present on the external monitor. \n\nA: fn + Left = \"fn\" Mac Key + Right = 4 finger swipe left or right = Moves to other desktop. Apps that are in full screen will be put on other desktops. \n\nA: Also, you may want to try:\n\nCTRL + Up/Down Arrow \n\nThat's what you get for a 3 fingers slide. \n\nA: You can also assign applications to particular \"desktops\" or using desktop numbers.\n", "Q: Macbook pro constantly crashing We have a Macbook Pro (see spec below) that consistently crashes, it can run for anything up to two hours but the crashing seems completely random within that time.\nI've attached the spec and error message below, does anyone have any ideas of what it could be?

As a old-school Unix junkie I don't like being forced to use a mouse when a simple keyboard shortcut would do. Today I found myself needing to login to an OSX machine just to launch an app, but the system's mouse had a dead battery. I tried about every key I could think of on the keyboard and could not figure out how to select a user  from the login screen. I could change the system volume and any number of other useless actions, but a keystroke that would change the input focus to the user selector was beyond my ability to guess.\nEven more frustratingly, when I did finally hook up a mouse, merely moving it seemed to bring the login window into focus and the arrow buttons could be used to select a user.\nOn attempting to duplicate this later, it seems the initial login screen does have keyboard input focus and works on first bootup. However if you either wait a minute or two for the mouse connection dialog a dialog pops up wanting you to connect a mouse. This steals the input focus and never gives it back to the login screen. If you do not connect a mouse or if an almost-dead wireless one connects and disconnects, the login screen cannot be accessed from the keyboard.\nIs there a key-binding I am missing that will re-focus the login page? Or is one just stranded at that point? Is there a keystroke that will reboot the system so you can catch it before the mouse connect dialoge pops up?\n\nA: It's certainly not an elegant solution but you can use the VoiceOver screen reader to accomplish something similar - at least to move the focus. VoiceOver is used by blind people to work the computer without a mouse at all and by using voice output and keyboard shortcuts.\nAt the login screen, press Command+F5 to enable VoiceOver. Your computer should start talking - and also display what it is saying in a small box in the lower-left of the screen. Try pressing Control-Option-Left and Right arrows to move the focus around. You should be able to select the different user accounts. Once you've selected the one you want hit Enter, then you can switch VoiceOver off (again Command+F5) and type your password. \nIf a window is in the way, you can use the Window Chooser to move focus. Normally this pops up an on-screen view, but apparently at the login screen it is voice-only. Press Control+Option+F2 twice rapidly, and you should hear Window Chooser. Use up and down arrow until you find Login window, then press Enter. Now the previous commands (Control+Option+Left/Right) should work. \nVoiceOver is a complex system so explaining it in any detail is out of scope for this question, but there are also ways to get rid of that mouse connect window.\n\nA: There are two ways to do it:\nMethod I:\nUse arrow key(s) (↑, ↓, ←, →) to select the desired user account.\nMethod II:\nJust type your account name on the lock screen. It will select the user account with the matching name, without any mouse click.\nOnce the desired user is selected, press enter to type the password.\n\nA: Had the same issue. Found that @Billos's 11/2016 answer works...\n\nctrl-option-shift-down arrow, then left/right to choose user.\n\nHowever, on my OS X 10.12.2 Sierra system, left arrow/right arrow alone work.\nNo need for ctrl-option-shift or VoiceOver.\n\nA: The clue was from activating the voice-over, which eventually tells you:\nCtrl + Option + Shift + Down Arrow simultaneously followed by left/right to choose user, \nYou don't need to activate voice over for this to work.\nThat is completely non-intuitive: a simple tab would solve this completely.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard layout via keyboard shortcut? I like to use both US and German keyboard layout but I find the process of switching between them via mouse tiresome. I want a keyboard-only solution.\nIs there a predefined shortcut to change between multiple keyboard layouts, or if not, how could I define such a shortcut?\n\nA: See this:\n\nPref panel => Keyboard => shortcuts => Input Sources then set your shortcut\nIf you have conflict a small yellow triangle will appear guiding you to the conflict shortcut. (disable or change it)\nIf the Spotlight appears, disable its shortcut.\n", "Q: Very small resolution on external monitor Windows 7 with Macbook Pro Retina I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13\", and I run both OSX and Windows 7. My Windows 7 is run in Parallels.\nI work with OSX on the screen of the Macbook, and Windows on an external monitor (with the typical 1900x1080 resolution).\nProblem is the Windows screen has very bad dimensions. Some things are very small, others are normal size. Screenshot:\n\nWhen I go into my screen resolution it says 3840x2160, which seems very high. However, when I go lower, for instance to 1920x1080, I get the following which looks totally bad on my monitor (extremely big icons / other things):\nAny idea how to get a normal resolution of my Windows screen?\n\n\nA: I got it fixed, by selecting \"Scaled\" in the options in Parallels. Then I could change the screen resolution, and I had no problems in Windows 7. Success!\n\n", "Q: Is it normal that the ad-hoc url doesn't work in the simulator?

It will close on it's own in a minute or so and it still appears as being open when you check to see what applications are open.\nI have received two messages that I can not read or get to. How to fix the Messages?\n\nA: Start off by looking here for how to close open apps in iOS7. Close Messages, then try opening it again. If that fails, close Messages again, turn the phone off completely (by holding the sleep/wake button down), wait a few minutes, turn the phone on again and try looking at your messages again.\n", "Q: How can I read Xcode documentations in browser instead of documentation viewer?

The iPhone 5-series phones all support LTE but if I only have a contract for 3G service will my iPhone battery drain faster because it's always trying to find an an LTE-capable signal? Can I stop it from even looking for LTE?\n\nA: I know it's not specifically what you're asking, but you can disable LTE in settings.\nSettings > Cellular > Enable LTE (switch to off)\n\n\nA: Leaving the LTE on will not drain your battery life. The data modem in your phone (a Qualcomm MDM9615M) is a chip that handles LTE and 3G signals. Therefore, your phone is not using a 3G chip and then draining your battery by having a second chip search for a LTE signal.\n", "Q: Why does directory vanish when I do SSHFS? I'm running Max OSX 10.9.3 and I'm trying to setup an SSHFS file-share between my MacBook Pro and a remote file system. However, when I try to do it, it doesn't work.\nStrangely enough, it makes the target directory disappear. Has anyone else seen this happen? Is it a bug?\nFirst see that I can ssh normally into the target machine:\n% ssh remoteuser@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX            # <--- SSH to remote system works! See below.\nremoteuser@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX % ls -altr remoteDir\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x 26 remoteuser remoteuser 4096 Jun 22 01:00 ..\ndrwxrwxrwx  2 remoteuser remoteuser 4096 Jun 22 01:08 .\nremoteuser@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX % exit\n%                                           # <--- Logged out of remote system\n\nNext, I create a directory locally and verify it was created:  \n% pwd\n/mnt\n\n% ls\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x  31 root  admin  1122 Jun 18 18:34 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root  admin    68 Jun 23 08:11 ./\n\n% sudo mkdir share1 \n% ls\ndrwxr-xr-x  31 root  admin  1122 Jun 18 18:34 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  admin   136 Jun 23 08:50 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root  admin    68 Jun 23 08:50 share/\n\nNow I try to setup the SSHFS share:\n% sudo sshfs remoteuser@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:remoteDir /mnt/share1\nremoteuser@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX's password:\n%\n\nOk.

Not only is the File Sharing not working, but the share1 directory seems to have vanished! (Although the file system seems to know it is missing, which is weird).\nWhere did /mnt/share1 go and how do I setup this SSHFS?\n\nA: On OSX you should run the mounting command as your own regular user, not root.\nsshfs user@host:/ ~/sshfs -oauto_cache,reconnect,defer_permissions,noappledouble,negative_vncache,volname=MySSHFSMount\n\n\nA: This is very late, but I saw it because I googled the same issue. The problem seems to be that your system  still thinks that the directory is mounted by the sshfs connection. What I did to solve the problem is use the following command in the Terminal umount -f /path/to/the/vanishing/directory.\nOnce you do that, your directory should be freed, and then you can go to your desktop and hold control and \"right\" click (two finger click) the finder icon, and choose relaunch. The directories will pop back up on your desktop.\n\nA: Try to enable some of the options mentioned in https://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/OPTIONS or to mount the volume somewhere else:\nmkdir /tmp/sshfs\nsshfs user@host -o reconnect,local,allow_other,defer_permissions /tmp/sshfs\n\nOS X doesn't have /mnt/, but you can just mount the sshfs volume anywhere.\n", "Q: Deleting iCloud contents locally I haven't really ever intentionally used iCloud; however, upon browsing ~/Library/Mobile Documents, I noticed that I must have unintentionally saved several files to iCloud.\nUnfortunately, I can't remember any of my password/security credentials--or even the email address--I provided when I set up the facility. I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not going to be able to recover any of these credentials (unless somebody provides some untried suggestion), rendering the account pretty much useless.\nAs a result, I'd like to remove all documents saved in error to iCloud. Can this be done locally without the credentials?\nWill deleting files from ~/Library/Mobile Documents delete files from iCloud too or just locally (on my MacBook)?\n\nA: Deleting files from Mobile Documents will delete them from iCloud if you are currently signed in to iCloud and the Documents & Data service is active.\nIf you are not currently signed in, you can delete the files to reclaim local space but this will not delete the files from iCloud.\n", "Q: Should you unplug the cable once your MBP is fully charged?

Doesn't this eventually cause the battery to die faster because it means it'll have to go through more cycles frequently?\n\nA: Personally if I am using the machine I will keep the charger plugged in until I'm done, regardless of whether its full or not, if I'm not using the machine I will unplug when its full.\nRead up on Apple's official recommendations, there is some good stuff here:\nhttp://www.apple.com/batteries/\nFollow the links at the bottom.\n", "Q: App Store asking for other Apple ID when updating apps My friend's mate reset his phone to prove him wrong about a situation and ever since then when he tries to update his apps it asks for his mom's iCloud password yet it says at the bottom of the App Store, iTunes and iCloud that it's signed into his account.\nWe have tried backing it up into his computer but that didn't help. What can be done?\n\nA: If it's asking for a different Apple ID to update an app or apps, then they have been purchased on the other Apple account.\nYou can't change the Apple ID that an app has been purchased with. Instead, delete the app from the device and purchase it again with the Apple ID that you want the app registered to.\n", "Q: Track appearing in iOS Music as an iCloud track that I do not own I was listening to one of my playlists (not Radio) on my iPhone, and (at least) two tracks came up that I do not own and are not in my iTunes library on my Mac. I am the only person using this iCloud account and I've never purchased these tracks or had them in my library. The tracks did appear in the playlist with an iCloud icon, which I used to think showed tracks that I have in iCloud but not on my phone, but I don't know why these tracks are in iCloud.\nWhy did these tracks play and/or where did they come from?\n\nA: First of all, if you ever participate in iTunes' free singles, those will obviously count as iTunes tracks. (It used to be called Single of the Week, I believe, but now it's found just under \"Free on iTunes\" on the Mac/PC versions of iTunes.)\nBy the same token, participating in any of those promotions - 12 Days of Christmas, iTunes Festival, etc. where music can be \"purchased for free\", those will count as tracks in your iTunes library that you can retrieve via iCloud.\nAlso, some tracks over the years came with free bonus downloads. You'd buy one song and some other promo song would be attached. Through the years, iTunes has done all sorts of weird, interesting and sometimes confusing promotions. (Among others, there was a Starbucks free song promo, the Pepsi 100 million free songs promo, etc.etc.)\nThe final obvious option is someone gifted the song to you at some point, for some reason.\nIf you want to figure out exactly what happened, you can check your purchase history in iTunes. On a computer, go to the iTunes store in iTunes, then at the top of the store UI, click your user account Email address and then choose Account. Provide your Apple ID password, then scroll down to Purchase History and click \"Show All\". If you have a long history with iTunes (I got in the game in 2003 when it all started!!!) then it may take a bit of time. Look through the list and find out if these tracks are appearing in any purchase. I'm not sure if received gifts show up in purchase history, but anything you actively clicked on \"buy\" or \"download\" will show up - even free stuff.\n(I don't know your situation, but perhaps someone accidentally purchased it using your device? And the 99 cent charge would be easy to miss if you're not a person who carefully monitors your credit card bills...) \nIf you seriously do not see the tracks anywhere in your account, but they are still showing up as iCloud tracks in iTunes, then it could simply be an Apple glitch. Weirder things have been known to happen. If you buy a lot of music, you can't really \"disable\" just those two songs, but you can remove them from any playlists, and you can uncheck them in iTunes on your computer. \nHope this helps.\nF\n", "Q: Songs purchased on iPhone won't sync back to the iPhone from iTunes I've run into this problem a couple of times:\n\n\n*\n\n*I purchase a song on the iPhone via the iTunes Store app.\n\n*I re-download the song on iTunes on my Mac.\n\n*I add the song to an existing playlist in iTunes.\n\n*I attempt to sync my iPhone with iTunes.\n\n\nAfter step 4, I would expect that the updated playlist would be on the iPhone.  Instead, I find that the purchased song has been removed from the iPhone and the playlist on the iPhone is now 1 song short of number of tracks that iTunes reports.\nIf I purchase a song on iTunes or on another iOS device, but do steps 2 - 4, the problem doesn't happen.  It only happens when a song has been purchased on the device first.\nBoth the iPhone and iTunes are using the same Apple ID in this case.  I was able to solve this problem in the past by doing a combination of restoring the device and also manually removing the songs/albums from the Music tab for the iPhone in iTunes.  I've removed the songs this time, but no luck.  I'd rather not have to restore the device completely every time I make a song purchase on my iPhone, so I'm looking for other possible solutions here.\nEDIT:\nI've also now found that if I re-download one of the missing songs onto my iPhone after syncing with iTunes, that it will show up in the playlists (which only iTunes knew about).  Once I sync with iTunes again, the song will be removed from the device.\nAt this point, it's sounding more and more like a bug in either iOS or iTunes, so I'm going to go off and file a bug report with Apple.\n\nA: In the Apple support forums I found that if you log out of your AppleID on the iPhone (settings / iTunes & App Store) and log back in, you can sync again from iTunes and those purchased songs will now get synced with the iPhone again.\n", "Q: Cannot paste image in Skype, Line, or Facebook Messenger but pasting works in WeChat and iMessage In iOS 7, we're able to paste an image into iMessage, WeChat, and Whatsapp, but not Line, Skype, or Facebook Messenger.\nIs this an app-supported setting?\nThanks!\n\nA: Pasting in images into the app requires support from the app's developer to allow this. This isn't as simple as a setting and therefore can't be adjusted externally.\n", "Q: Restoring to a 10.6.8 from Time Machine that backed up a 10.8 system I spilled coffee on my Macbook Air and didn't turn it off in time. It's fried.\nI have a Time Machine backup of the entire system. I believe it was running 10.8 when it died.\nI want to format my old Macbook 2008 (currently running 10.6.8) and restore my system to the old Macbook.  Is it possible, even though the system was running 10.8?  \nWould it be better to upgrade to 10.7 on the old Macbook and THEN do the Time Machine restore?\n\nA: Options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to Mavericks: it's free, and you can upgrade directly from 10.6.8 to 10.9. Then use Migration Assistant to restore the Time Machine backup. This is fully supported.\n\n*Upgrade to Mountain Lion; if you don't already own it, get it here. Then use Migration Assistant to restore the Time Machine backup. This is fully supported.\n\n*With some difficultly, you might be able to migrate your data manually. If you try this, you should probably clone your Time Machine backup volume first (just to be safe).\n\n\nEdit:\nWhen I wrote this response, I assumed the old \"Macbook 2008\" supported OS X 10.8 and 10.9. Then I checked everymac.com:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook (2008 white or black): Maximum OS X: 10.7.5\n\n\nOP did not specify which model the old 2008 MacBook is. If it's a unibody MacBook, or a MacBook Pro, or an \"NVIDIA\" MacBook Air, then the best option is to update to Mavericks (option 1), or if you really don't want Mavericks, then upgrade to Mountain Lion instead (option 2).\nIf it's a black or white MacBook, or an \"original\" MacBook Air, then it won't support Mavericks or Mountain Lion at all.\n", "Q: macbook to monitor via windows laptop I want to connect my macbook pro to my tv.  I do not have a hdmi cable but I do have a dvi cable.  I also have a usb to usb cable.  Is it possible to connect my macbook pro to windows laptop then connect that to the tv and be able to see the macbook's desktop on the tv? \n\nA: First off, I suggest just going for the appropriate adapter for your MacBook. If you have a Unibody MacBook Pro, you could use a mini DisplayPort to HDMI converter. If you have a newer Retina MacBook Pro, you can just use a plain old HDMI cable. Older non-unibody MacBooks could use a DVI-to-HDMI converter or cable.\n\n\n*\n\n*miniDP to HDMI (Monoprice, $6.85 + HDMI cable)\n\n*DVI to HDMI (Monoprice, $3.33, doesn't carry audio)\n\n*HDMI to HDMI can be found on Monoprice for around $3.00.\n\n\nIf you were looking to save money by not buying more adapters and cables and you're serious about using your MacBook with your TV, just buy the right cables and/or adapters. Sites like Monoprice.com and DX.com offer very inexpensive cables that are of no lesser quality to the ones found in big box stores and at the Apple store.\nTo do what you're asking, relaying through your PC, would require some sort of screen sharing or remote desktop software (over the network, not over USB) but would be more trouble than it's worth and would likely be unsatisfactory if you wanted to do anything graphics intensive (watching a movie, gaming, etc.).\nIf you really want to give it a shot, here's what I suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*In  your MacBook's System Preferences (since OS X Tiger), you can enable a VNC server. Open System Preferences -> Sharing -> enable \"Screen Sharing\" or on older  versions of OS X, \"Apple Remote Desktop\" -> go to \"Computer Settings\" or \"Access Privileges…\" -> check off \"VNC viewers may control screen with password: \" and set a good password.\n\n*On your PC, you have to install a VNC client or viewer. Two free clients come to mind, RealVNC and TightVNC. Either should work fine. I tried RealVNC. Download the standalone viewer .exe from their website. Find your MacBook's IP address from your router or the \"Network\" section in your System Preferences. Open RealVNC, type in the IP address, it will warn you that it's not encrypted, continue, enter the password you specified earlier. You should be connected!\n\n*Connect your PC to your TV and simply drag the VNC window over onto the TV or, if you're in mirrored mode, you should be good to go. You may have to adjust the resolution in VNC and on your MacBook to get it fit properly on your TV. I found it very laggy (unusable for text editing) over WiFi in Control Mode, so you may want to try going over Ethernet if possible.\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Determine what's using the 'system' cpu in OS X Mavericks I am running a job in R that forks multiple processes. Every once in a while it seems that when the forked processes return and the next job starts, the previously forked processes terminate, but the CPU for those processes moves from 'User' to 'System'. So my activity monitor looks like this:\n\nHow can I debug this? How can I determine what processes are using the 'System' section in the screenshot? They do not show up if I sort by CPU in activity monitor, or on another tab (e.g., memory).\nMy activity monitor is showing 'all processes', so I do see running processes for the root user. However, all of the 'System' CPU is unaccounted for in activity monitor. And I tried showing 'system processes', but nothing with high cpu shows up there (which makes sense since these processes also show up for 'all processes').\nThe R use case may not be relevant. Or it may be. But generally, what I'd like to know is how to determine what is using the 'System' portion of the CPU load in OS X Mavericks.\nEDIT: Here's an output of the top command. Same story.

I'm using 3 monitors at the same time and hitting cmd + tab is always the pain.\n\nA: You may be able to craft your own solution with a combination of scripting software and assistive hardware.\nAssistive hardware exists to track head movement. Most assistive hardware can be used to provide an input that can then be scripted via AppleScript or shell script.\nA few examples are linked below. I have no experience with these tools but your goal appears possible.\nHeadmouse\n\nHeadMouse® Extreme replaces the standard computer mouse for people who cannot use or have limited use of their hands when controlling a computer or alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) device. The HeadMouse translates natural movements of a user's head into directly proportional movements of the computer mouse pointer, so as the user moves their head the mouse pointer on the screen also moves.\n\n\nSmartNav\n\nThe SmartNav 4 AT is a total hands-free mouse solution. With built-in Dwell Clicking Software and a free On-screen Keyboard created by Lake Software. The AT package is used successfully by people with ALS, spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, and other special needs.\n\n\nOne Switch\nOne Switch sell a wide range of assistive hardware and link to associated software.\n\nThe following list details a number of different styles of head, mouth and eye operated controllers. Most of these are for PCs and Apple computers, but there are alternatives for games consoles too. Some of these devices are very expensive, so it is always worth trying to track down some way of trying before you buy.\n\n\nA: I haven't heard of any such software before, though it certainly may exist.\nHowever, there are a few problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*It would go crazy every time you turn around or look away from your current monitor: it's probably something you do much more often than you'd realize without the camera tracking your head and doing stuff based on its position.\n\n*Most head-tracking software isn't sensitive enough to determine where your eyes are; that is, you'd have to turn your head completely toward the display for it to switch to that display, which would get annoying after a while because you'd have to exaggerate the head motion each time.\n\n\nEssentially, if you wanted it to be accurate enough to determine what you're actually focusing on, you'd have to go into eye tracking, which can be messy and not altogether accurate with a built-in camera that wasn't necessarily meant for that sort of thing.\nIn any case, what you're looking for probably isn't possible with the iSight camera and would require some extra hardware (Graham Miln has given you some options).\nThat said, you may want to look at the Leap Motion Controller, which has a fairly robust set of applications that probably has something like this (so, you'd gesture toward the display you want and it would switch), but it's probably not faster than CMD+Tab (though you wouldn't have to cycle through all of your running applications).\nIf that doesn't work (or you don't want to buy an $80 motion tracking device), there's always Better Touch Tool, which you could use to set up a few shortcuts (or trackpad/mouse actions) to switch displays for you.\n", "Q: Updating a MacPro from Snow Leopard to Mavericks I have Snow Leopard installed on an old MacPro. I want to upgrade to Mavericks.  When I go to AppStore-->Mavericks and click on the download button nothing happens.  Do I need to install the intermediate releases (Lion and Mountain Lion - I think).  If so, what is the process?\n\nA: If the Mac Pro is old enough, then it cannot be upgraded beyond Lion.  Check the listed requirements... My old Mac Pro 1,1 was in this category.  \nSee the chart at the bottom, \"latest supported OS\" HERE\n\nA: Just to check your doing everything right:\nThe download link should say Free and then Download once clicked on once, after that, press it again.\nFrom there it should ask you for your Apple ID username and password.\nThen it should start to download, as said above, Launchpad should have a progress bar on it's icon indicating something is downloading. Check the App Store for it too.\nAs stupid as this sounds, have you tried to restart your internet by unplugging its power for 10 seconds and reconnecting or even just checking your connection to see if anything is faulty?\nIt's a big update as shown above so unless you have enough bandwidth to download it your stuck.\nAlso another update for it came out Yesterday so it may be a good idea to try again.\n", "Q: Steps after buying a used iPhone I'm buying a used iPhone.  What steps should I take immediately after I receive the iPhone, to make sure that everything is OK, that I got what I paid for, and that I'm not receiving a lemon?\nFor instance, it might be nice to check that it wasn't reported stolen / blacklisted.  Also, I am buying a factory unlocked phone, so it'd be useful if there is an easy way to check to make sure I am receiving an unlocked iPhone.  Also, if there is any hardware that is frequently broken / not working on used devices, it might be useful to have a checklist for checking that hardware.\n\nRelated, but not identical:\n\n\n*\n\n*What to ask when buying a used iPhone 4, though that's different: it focuses on deciding whether to buy or not, and what to ask to help make that decision.\n\n*What are the steps to transfer an iPhone to someone else?, though that's different: it focuses on the seller's perspective and has a complicated scenario, whereas I'm interested in the buyer's perspective and have a simple scenario.\n\n*How to know where and when my iphone was bought?\n\n*Steps to be done before selling your iPhone\n\n*Find out if my iPhone is unlocked without purchasing another SIM\n\nA: Once you get your hands on the iPhone, put your SIM card in it, do a full reset, and after it restarts go through the initial setup phase - until you get to the main screen with the apps on it.\nMake sure you have a mobile phone signal (3G or 4G or whatever). That will tell you that the phone will work with your SIM.\nIt will also have activated the phone during that initial setup.\nIf the phone was previously assigned to another iCloud account, it may prompt you for the password for that account during that process. If the seller does not have the password, hand the phone back because it's a brick. And probably a stolen brick at that.\nAfter that, you're pretty much OK.\n\nA: Insert your SIM card (bring a paper clip to make it easy to pop out the SIM insertion tray), do a full reset, power it on, and go through the initial configuration process.\nCheck that you have a connection to your carrier.  Make a test phone call, to make sure that you have connectivity.\nGo to Settings > General > About, to check the phone model.  Check the capacity to make sure it matches what you were expecting.  For instance, if you were expecting a 16 GB iPhone, the capacity should say something like 13 GB.  If you wish, note the model number on the back and the model number on the Settings > General > About screen; you can look them up on the Internet to make sure you got the right model of phone that you were expecting.\nSee also the steps that Apple recommends you take to check that you can use a device that you purchase from someone else; it's basically as above.\n", "Q: Directories showing as files when browsing a Time Machine backup on Windows I have to grab some files from a time machine backup and I only have a Windows PC.  I downloaded the HFS+ filesystem drivers from MacRoumers (here) and plugged in my Time Machine Drive.  Everything appears normal, until I transverse into a specific backup.  There I see the \"Library\" directory, and every other folder (Desktop, Movies, Music...) are files.  It's like this in every backup instance, and I'm stuck.  I don't recall these folders being symlinks to earlier backups, but I could be wrong and these drivers don't support symlinks.\n\nA: When Time Machine makes a backup it only copies changed files and creates links to the older items. AFAIK these are not symlinks, but hardlinks. \nSample output from Time Machine\n23/06/2014 10:40:19.087 pm com.apple.backupd[12797]: Copied 4 items (33 bytes) from volume DeepThought.

What does that mean? Thanks.\n\nA: If you have several partitions on that disk, then it is telling you that you will lose the partition that has the Mac OS system installed on it, including all the data on that partition and the Mac OS system you have installed on there.\nMy advice is that if you don't understand the warnings, then you really should not be in there - it really is SO easy to click a few buttons and lose all your data.\n", "Q: Is there an app that lets me use an iPhone as a mouse? I'm looking for an app which enables me to physically maneuver my iPhone on the desk to control my Mac's cursor. (I am not looking for a \"remote trackpad\" app—there are dozens of those.) \nI did a great deal of searching and found nothing. Is this even possible? If so, is there an app in existence which provides this functionality?\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, the answer is no.  Of course, without trying out every single mouse app in the App Store, I can't be 100% certain.\nI can tell you that I've been a long time user of Mobile Mouse.  They have about the best mouse/remote control app I've found.  They put a lot of effort into trying to get the app to work like a real mouse, and eventually decided that it couldn't be done, at least not with an acceptable level of performance (see FAQ #6).  They decided on the \"air mouse\" mode instead, and though it doesn't work like a real mouse, it does work very well for what it is.\nBest of luck in your search, and of course if you do find such an app, please let us know!\n\nA: Remote Mouse is a free app downloadable from the iOS App Store, which can act as a trackpad, \"Wiimote\" style controller, or keyboard.\nYou also have to download the Remote Mouse Server app from the Mac App Store onto the Mac you wish to control.\nThis app DOES NOT work as a mouse in the traditional sense. The closest feature to a mouse that is offered is that of a \"Wiimote\" style controller, where the user can wave their iPhone in the air while pointing it at the screen to move the cursor.\n\nA: Remotemouse\nThere is a app named remotemouse in the app store i personally have used this app so you can try it.  Its easy to use as mouse.  Hope this will help you. \n\nA: Again, not what you want, but I prefer HippoRemote to the other iPhone-as-software-mouse suggestions because it doesn't require a server app to be running on your computer; you are allowed access to the computer via IP address by logging in with your user ID and you can choose to either have the app retain or erase that information. The pay version of the app also allows for specialized profiles for a variety of common apps and you can create your own profiles for others as well as create macros. \nI believe that what you are looking for would require either a specialized \"mouse pad\" with sensors that could more accurately discern its movements or advancements in the in-iPhone motion sensors. Depending on your use case, which you have not shared with us, you might want to look into Leap Motion or some hacked together solution using a bluetooth stylus. Given that the OS X UI has been moving increasingly toward accessibility via specialized touch pad/gesture actions and with the coming increase in size of the iPhone, making it even more unwieldy to move with any precision, I find it unlikely that that effort will be made to accommodate or incorporate the features you're looking for.\n\nA: For iPhone there is Rowmote and man more (just search for Mouse) - if you find them in the iPad-AppStore they work.\nAlso you may take a look at AirDisplay it can make your iPad to a second Monitor but also it gives you the abillity to have a touchscreen Display.\nAlso you could use a VNC client to Remote Control your Mac/PC.\n\nA: I have been using Remote Mouse (available on the App Store) for a while now.  There's no lag, no delay; It's simply amazing, it is worth checking out. \nI hope it helps\n", "Q: Hotkey to menubar app in Mavericks I have Mountain App running in my menu bar (it is an app that allows you to quickly mount and unmount drives attached to your computer). I would like to create a simple script that calls up the menu on the app (which runs only on the menu bar). I tried to follow the instructions and code found here: Create hotkey to open a menubar app?, replacing the name of the app where relevant\nlaunch application \"System Events\"\n  delay 0.2\n  ignoring application responses\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Mountain\"\n      click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n    end tell\n  end ignoring\n\n  do shell script \"killall System\\\\ Events\"\n  delay 0.1\n  tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Mountain\"\n    tell menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2\n      click menu item 2 of menu 1\n    end tell\n  end tell\n\nbut it did not work for me, giving me an error in Applescript:\nerror \"System Events got an error: Can’t get menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 of process \\\"Mountain\\\". Invalid index.\"\n    number -1719 from menu 1 of menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 of process \"Mountain\"\n\nPlaying around with the menu and other code pieces never got the app to activate the menu. I also tried creating a \"Watch Me Do\" applescript, but it will only work in automator and I couldn't get it to work globally or in any other app. \nI am not a coder or programmer, so rely on some level of creativity and googling around to figure this stuff out. Anyone have a suggestion? It seems like such a simple thing to do, but my searches have found that it is not.\nEDIT: I have seen the tool clickclick suggested elsewhere as a way to accomplish a mouse click. However, my understanding is that for clickclick to work, the exact coordinates of Mountain in the menu bar would need to stay the same. Is that a correct assumption in this case? If I recall, those icons in the menu bar change location on every restart or if a menu app is quit. \n\nA: The problem in this case seems to be that Mountain.app is not a \"proper\" part of the menu bar, at least as far as \"System Events\" is concerned. \nYou can see this also when you use (fn+) ctrl+F8; this should put keyboard focus on the status menus, so that you can navigate them with the arrow keys. \nSome extra menu items (e.g. iStat menus) can be selected this way, while others can not. This, I believe, translates to accessibility with AppleScript via \"System Events\". \n", "Q: Can I use non-apple headphones with an iPhone? Is it okay to connect non-Apple headphones to an iPhone (a 5s, in this case) or do I need to use apple branded or authorized headphones for some reason?\n\nA: Here is the visual comparison of Apple TRRS plug and a standard TRS plug.\n\nOn the top you can see a 4-pin headset connector. A headset connector needs to be using the same TRRS standard, or it will not function properly if at all.\nOn the bottom you can see a 3-pin headphone connector. Any headphone connector will work fine.\n\nStandard 3.5mm jack stereo headphones have a 3-conductor configuration of TRS (Tip, Ring, Sleeve). The pinout for these connectiors is: Left Audio, Right Audio, Ground. Connectors for headphones with a mic have an additional ring which results in a 4-conductor TRRS configuration (Tip, Ring, Ring, Sleeve).\nThere have been different TRRS standards:\n\n\n*\n\n*The original OMTP configuration, which was created by Nokia and has a pinout of Left Audio, Right Audio, Mic, Ground.\n\n*AHJ (American Headset Jack) with a pinout of Left Audio, Right Audio, Ground, Mic.\n\n*CTIA, named after The Wireless Association, which replaced AHJ and has the same pinout. CTIA jacks have improved compatibility to support not only AHJ but also OMTP. CTIA is by default required for Android device manufacturers.\n\n\n\nSource: All About Windows Phone\nWikipedia has a short overview for which device uses which standard.\nAt last a few points to note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plugging an OMTP headset into an AHJ jack, and vice versa, will result in the audio-out being inaudible or very quiet. Converters to switch between the two types of headsets are readily available, but do add extra bulk, and may not work reliably with remote control functionality.\n\n*Apple uses a CTIA/AHJ connector arrangement, but uses a non-standard microphone and volume control signaling method. Simple commands like Play/Pause and Skip however should work across modern mobile devices.\n\n\nA: Any headphones with a 3.5mm headphone jack will work fine with the iPhone, not just Apple products.\n\nA: Sennheiser makes great headphones for iPhone with working mic/remote. I have the version for Android phones and everything works fine and sounds great. Just make sure you check the package for the \"made for iPhone\" label.\n\nA: Any headphone with a 3.5mm jack will work. \nBut be mindful about the remote controls. If it doesn't specifically says compatible with iPhone/iPod, it may not work with your iPhone. \nAs long as you just care about listening to sound on the headphones, as long as the tip is undamaged and standard, you won't harm the iPhone using any headphones.\n\nA: And note that some headsets have plugs with 4 metal bands, but the order is different, these won't work (older Nokia, for instance):\nInstead of\n\"mic, ground, right, left\"\nthey will have\n\"ground, mic, right, left\"\n\nA: I misplaced my iPhone headphones but had my old Blackberry Bold headphones (with the remote attached).  These worked perfectly on my iPhone 5.\n\nA: I use Yurbuds Ironman Inspire Black In-Ear Sport Headphones, purchased at a TELUS store and they work perfectly well as regular earphones when I want privacy as well as in the proper mode including the mic function with my iPhone 5s and they should also work with an iPhone 6.  \n", "Q: how can I back up my contact name list My contacts on my IPhone 4s was lost.

You can do this by restarting your Mac while holding down the command + r keys. Keep holding the two keys until you see the Recovery HD desktop appear.\nYou will see the OS X Utilities window open on your desktop, with various options available in its window. You can ignore this window; there's nothing we need to do with it.\nInstead, select Terminal from the Utilities menu at the top of the screen.In the Terminal window that opens, enter the following:\n    resetpassword\n\nPress enter or return.\nThe Reset Password window will open.\nMake sure the Reset Password window is the front-most window.\nFrom the Utilities menu, select Reset Password.\nIn the Reset Password window that opens, select the drive that contains your home folder; this is usually your Mac's startup drive.\nUse the drop-down menu to select the user account whose home folder permissions you wish to fix.\nDo not enter any password information.\nDO NOT click the Save button.\nInstead, click the Reset button located just below the \"Reset Home Folder Permissions and ACLs\" text.\nThe process may take a while, depending on the size of the home folder. Eventually the Reset button will change to say Done.\nQuit the Reset Password utility by selecting Quit from the Reset Password menu.\nQuit the OS X Installer by selecting Quit Mac OS X Installer from the Mac OS X Installer menu.\nClick the Restart button.\nOnce you quit the Reset Password app, be sure to quit the Terminal app by selecting Quit Terminal from the Terminal menu.\n\nFrom the OS X Utilities menu, select Quit OS X Utilities.\n\nYou'll be asked if you really want to exit OS X Utilities; click the Restart button.\n\nThat's all there is to resetting your user account's file permissions back to the correct default settings. At this point, you can use your Mac as you normally would. The problems you were experiencing should be gone.\nSource\n", "Q: How can I show the full notifications in the notification center? I cannot read the full notification (see attached). How can I?\n\n\nA: Notification Center limits the size of a notification to 256 bytes (see developer reference), so there is no way to expand or change how much of a notification you see (unless you can find some third-party application that disables the limit).\nAfter 256 bytes, the notification will be truncated and the user has to click on the notification to see the rest.\nFor example, if Mail.app sends you a notification of a new message, you likely won't be able to read the whole message from the notification, so you'll have to click on it to open the message in Mail.\nHowever, if the notification is purely informative and does not point to a specific piece of data within the application, when you click on the notification, it will only open the application or, if it is already running, bring it to the foreground.\nTerminal is not a UI-based application, so notifications from it are not going to focus on a specific element. A notification from Terminal will simply open the application because its notifications are plaintext messages from the application that don't point to a specific UI element or piece of data.\n\nA: Short answer: You cannot. You need to click on the notification to read it. \nThere is no long answer here. \n", "Q: Can iPhone wake me up if I completely turn it off? On the feature phones I used to have, I could set the alarm clock, then turn the phone \"off\": the alarm clock would trigger at the set time anyway. Can I do this on iPhone?\nBy \"off\" (in quotes, because, we know that from electrical point of view, some parts of the phone stay powered) I mean the state of the phone you get when it is turned on, then you press the power button for a couple of seconds, then a red slider appears saying \"slide to power off\" and then you slide it.\n\nA: Playing the Clock alarm sound requires the main application ARM processor/CPU to be running the OS and Clock app.  When you \"slide to power off\", power to the main CPU, radios and audio amplifier is removed.  So, although the iOS device keeps time (as long as the battery isn't completely dead yet), it can't run the Clock app to play any sound.\nWhen you just \"lock\" the device (quickly tap the top button and the display turns off), the CPU still occasionally gets power (something like a few times per second), and the audio circuits can be powered and active (to allow background music, etc.), so alarms can go off in that state.\n\nA: The alarm will not ring since that code runs on hardware that is powered off and a software stack that is shut down at that point.\nThe only two items that will start an iOS device that has gone through the slide to power off \"power down\" process is plugging in to power and pressing the lock/wake button.\nNothing functions on the hardware in this state except the real time clock component and the hardware responsible for powering up the device / responding to USB power being applied to initiate charging and power up.\n\nA: Nop, it can't. The simple reason is because you turn off the power. So there is no way to count time and to know when it should ring\n\nA: To answer your question in a short manner...\nNo, when you shutdown you iPhone by holding the power button and sliding to power off you are completely disabling your iPhone. Same with the battery being dead.\nIt will not turn on to wake you up.\nIt will stay off nothing will happen.\nIt will only wake you up if it has battery power and is turned on.\n", "Q: The OS X GUI won't accept any passwords (but the command line will) The graphical side of OS X has stopped accepting passwords for any account. I am definitely typing them right, but the password box just wiggles \"no.\" And here's the weird part: I can log in from >console mode. I can log in via SSH. sudo works just fine. The command line happily accepts my password; the graphical side absolutely refuses.\nThings I've already tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a new user from the command line. Couldn't log in as that one, either.\n\n*Used my Apple ID to reset my password. That part worked, but when OS X autofilled the new password and tried to log in for me, all I got was the \"no\" wiggle.\n\n*Backed up ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain and replaced it with an empty file. Nope.\n\n*Created a fresh system keychain with sudo /usr/sbin/systemkeychain -C -f. Nope.\n\n*Booted into the recovery partition and verified/repaired the disk and its permissions. No apparent effect.\n\n*Update: Booted into safe mode. Still couldn't log in.\n\n*Confirmed that there are no wireless keyboards connected to the computer.

In Time Machine's package contents > resources, all I see is backup.icns (the Finder icon), menu.plist, and 33 .lproj folders for different languages. In the English folder is a single file called Menu.strings.\n\nA: The Time Machine menu bar item is located at:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/TimeMachine.menu/\n\nThe menu bar item uses four PDFs for the four different icon states, in Contents/Resources/:\n\n\n\n\nAbove icons from OS X 10.10 Yosemite DP2\n", "Q: Recover Picasa people/face data I had thousands of photos tagges with face info for family in Picasa (on Mac).\nI thought this info was stored online.\nNow I switched computers, and all the face info is gone. I'd hate to have to 'retrain' Picasa.\nIs there any way to recover/restore this training?\nI have a backup of old computer -- is it stored there somewhere?\n\nA: From Picasa Resources\n\nBy default, Picasa stores the face tags in the (hidden) .picasa.ini files in the folder where the picture is located on your hard disk.\nBut... it is a lot safer that you let Picasa store the face tag information inside .jpg files:\nstart Picasa, go to \"Tools\"/\"Options\" in the menu. On the Name Tags tab, put a check mark by the Store name tags in photo option. When you have this option checked, any new faces that you tag will be stored inside the photo in the standard XMP Metadata section. This does not affect existing face tags.\nSetting the previous option only takes care that all future name tags are added into the XMP metadata section. To have all existing face tags saved in the .jpg, go to \"Tools\"/\"Experimental...\"/\"Write faces to XMP...\" and choose \"Write faces\".  The Write Faces process will take some time, because it has to write all the face tags to all the photos in your photo collection, so take a break and let it do it's work.\n\nIn light of this - I would recommend finding the hidden files on your previous backup, and replacing them on your machine, or adding them if they don't exist. From there, you can follow the instructions above to write the data into the images themselves.\n", "Q: Get full path of script in PATH environment variable I was wondering if there is a built-in command in Bash (or even something OSX-specific) that would display the fully resolved path of a script that is in the current PATH environment variable.\nFor example, my PATH currently looks like this:\n>: echo $PATH | tr \":\" \"\\n\"\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n/opt/X11/bin\n/Users/Josh/Dropbox/Scripts/Bash\n/Users/Josh/Dropbox/Tools/WinRAR/OSX\n\nAnd there's a script in Dropbox called get-azurelogs.sh. That path is in my PATH variable for convenience, but if I wanted to display the complete path to that script, assuming I wasn't sure where it was, is there an simple one-liner way to display the fully resolved path instead of testing it at each of the directories above?\n\nA: You can use which.  From the man page:\n\nThe which utility takes a list of command names and searches the path for each executable file that would be run had these commands actually been invoked\n\n\nA: A good alternative to which is the builtin type. The advantage being that type is also able to handle bash aliases and functions.\n\nA: which -a [nameofexecutable]\n\nIE:\nMacbook-Pro:~ njboot$ which -a chmod \n/bin/chmod\nMacbook-Pro:~ njboot$ which -a nusers\n/Users/njboot/bin/nusers\n\n", "Q: iPhone shows wrong location I recently moved and my iPhone still shows my old address for location services (e.g. in the Maps app and 3rd party applications that use Apple's location services). I assume the source of the problem is that my wifi router, which moved with me, is listed in an internal Apple wifi geolocation database.\nI've tried rebooting the phone, turning off and on wifi, turning off and on airplane mode, etc.  Nothing has made a difference. It's been about 2 weeks now.\nAny advice? Is there any way to submit the new location to Apple the way there is for map errors?\n\nA: It turns out the only thing to do is wait. I called Apple and the rep said that if power cycling the phone and \"forgetting\" the wifi network didn't help, the Apple database would clear stale entries after 30 to 60 days. Sure enough, after about a month my phone started showing the new location.\n(Note: I tried @bmike's procedure several times on each of the iPhones in our household, but it didn't seem to make a difference. It could be that the procedure does remove that phone's historical location info from Apple's database, but over the many years we were living at our old address we had enough guests with iPhones that removing only our own phones' records wasn't sufficient. If anyone else is having this problem you might as well try that procedure, but know that the problem will self-resolve within a month or so.)\n\nA: Yes, you need to opt in to this feature to update locations for your local WiFi conditions. \nGo to Settings app -> Privacy -> Location Services -> System Services -> Frequent Locations -> Turn on Frequent Locations and Improve Maps\nIf you have already opted in, then you should turn off Location Services entirely.\nSettings app -> Privacy -> Location Services - OFF\nThen turn off WiFi and follow the steps on improving GPS - which basically is set the date/time and then power off the phone. Now turn it back on and while WiFi is off, try opening maps and move to a place where GPS is possible to receive a satellite signal.\nPress the triangle/chevron and see that the location updates. Once you've done that, go ahead and turn WiFi on. Also, you might optionally check for an iOS update and then update your carrier settings. (Settings app -> About -> Tap on the carrier settings and record the values. If there is an over the air update, it should prompt you to load it. If not, you could call your carrier and check that your settings are up to date.\nThe opting out, and then reboot is important to give the servers time to clear your old data as well as send the iPhone through the start up location finding algorithms in my experience. Once the reboot is done, you can enable the location and verify that frequent locations is set appropriately.\n\nA: System Preference > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy.\nThat worked for me! \n\nA: It turned out on my iPhone 6+ that the app (Je suis Charlie) was neither on or off in the location list. The same with several other apps. After that everything works OK.\n\nA: I had the same problem, in my case (settings > general > language & region) was Australia instead of United States, I changed it to USA, cleared cache and browsing history of Safari... and this works... try this\n\nA: I reset my network settings every time unfortunately but it works \n", "Q: Where is my Java console on OS X? I can't find the Java console in Preferences nor in Utilities. \nCan I open the Java console from a Terminal command?\nRunning OS X 10.7.5 and Java version 1.6.0_65\n\nA: It is somewhat maddening, but the Java console won't display unless a Java application is actually running. The easiest way to get it started is to visit https://www.java.com/verify/ from the Firefox browser.\n\nA: If you're opening a Runnable Jar (one which you click in finder to open), just try running it in terminal (from Spotlight search) using java -jar /path/to/file.jar.\nIf it's a Java Web Applet, you need to go into System Preferences -> Java -> Advanced -> Show Console -> Apply. From here, you'll need to actually run the program before the console displays, as @danorton said.\n\n'The easiest way to get it started is to visit https://www.java.com/verify/ from the Firefox browser.'\n\n", "Q: Non Stop Kernel Panics on Mavericks I've been facing a really hard kernel panic problem.\nI bought this macbook pro 17\" about 5 months ago and at that time I had a few kernel panics but didn't event bothered cause I could still use it anyway.\nA month from now I couldn't even work cause there would be kp's every 5 minutes. I'm from Brazil and there's no Genius Bar over here so I sent to the authorized support guys in my city. It stayed there for about 2 weeks and they couldn't map the problem. I was told to try and send it to a different city via mail but i'm really afraid something would happen to the machine.\nThe thing is I have no more warranty and the support couldn't fix it. The only way to get pass the problem is to log in safe boot, which is what i'm doing now so that I can write.\nThe log is below and I'm not really sure but apparently they're different every time. I still believe it can be something I can solve at home due to the fact that in safe boot it works properly for as long as I want so I don't think it's hardware related, hopefully.\nAnonymous UUID:

Reset ACL's.\n\n*Use Console after system crash/lockup, remember the time, and find in Console the activity before the crash.\n\n*update your EFI and SMC to latest.\n\n*Last not Least,- If you have saved the Mavericks installer use it to reinstall, if not use the Internet recovery.\nMost important is to get the information from Console at the time stamp of the crash to see what lead to it.\nYour system information of relevance:\nMavericks 10.9.3 (Mac OS version: 13D65)\nGraphics AMD Radeon HD 6750M\n\nA: There are several Apple support pages on Kernel Panics. \n\"When your computer spontaneously restarts or displays \"Your computer restarted because of a problem.\"' -- http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4636\n\"Mac OS X: How to log a kernel panic\" -- http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2546\nSee the links on these pages if you want to go deeper.\n", "Q: Hide .DS_Store and .localized from Desktop only without 3rd party app There is an app called XtraFinder which does exactly that - it shows hidden files while it can still hide those two files from Desktop only.\nIs it possible to do something like that without installing a 3rd party app (I'm using Mavericks)?\n\nA: This first command will remove all the icons on your Desktop, but keep the files visible in finder:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false && killall Finder\n\nWhile this second one will restore all the icons on your Desktop:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true && killall Finder\n\n\nA: Just like any other hidden file on your Mac, .DS_Store and .localized are going to be one of those files that appear when you turn hidden files 'on'.\nWithout 3rd party applications you are not able to hide them without hiding every other hidden application.\nOne thing you can do is, if there is only 1 or 2 hidden files/folders for eg. make aliases which in Windows standards are shortcuts. So Right Click the file > Make Alias.\nThen when all files are hidden, the alias/s will still be visible rendering the file/folder openable.\nAnother thing you can do is actually delete .DS_Store and .localized which according to Wikipedia (I know, not the most reliable source but multiple other websites also said it)\n\n.DS_Store is a proprietary format hidden file created by Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X operating system to store custom attributes of a folder such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image.\nThe '.localized' files just indicate (by their presence) that apps should display the \"localized\" name for a given folder if one has been defined. So for example, instead of the folder names showing as \"Library\" or \"Users\", someone with their language set to \"French\" in the \"International\" pref pane would see \"Bibliothèque\" or \"Utilisateurs\" in \"Finder\" or through \"Open\" and \"Save\" dialogues.\n\nThe .localized file basically makes it use the system's language for files (Mine is in English so it shows English).\n\nA: I came up with a brilliant way of doing this today.\nWhere do you usually have your Dock bar? Move it to the opposite side temporarily. Grab both the files and position them as far as possible off the screen on the side that you previously had your Dock. Now, switch the Dock back to the previous side.

I plugged my new iphone into my computer and it asked if I wanted to restore my old iphone settings.  I clicked yes not realizing I would lose everything from the last 8 months since I got the new phone.  Is there any way to restore what was on the new phone?\n\nA: Open iTunes preferences, there's a \"Devices\" tab that shows you any backups stored on that computer, but if you've never connected it in between I can hardly imagine there's an older backup.\nDid you connect your phone to any computer in the last 8 months, or did you eventually use iCloud backups? You could check those as well..\n", "Q: Multiple macs self-assigned IP on ethernet (wifi okay though) I have a small CAT-6 ethernet network featuring a Cisco 18-port switch and an Asus router acting as DHCP server.\nVarious devices connected to the switch (e.g. printer, NAS) connect to the DHCP server successfully to receive addresses in the 192.168.1.* range.  My Macbook Pro and Mac mini also connect over wifi to the router to receive DHCP addresses in the same range.\nThe Macbook and the Mac Mini (both latest Mavericks) fail to connect via the switch when using ethernet and end up with self-assigned 169...* addresses. With the Macbook Pro I've tried this with three different USB to ethernet dongles, including an Apple model. Setting the ethernet parameters manually doesn't seem to help access the switch either.\nThis makes me think there's some configuration with ethernet under Mavericks that doesn't match my setup with the 192.168.1.* range?  I'm assuming the Cisco switch is not the problem as other devices seem to connect through it fine.\nCan someone give me a hint as how to work out what's going on?  Does Mavericks always try and look for DHCP servers in the 10.0.0.* range instead?  \nThanks,\nStu\n\nA: I'll answer and accept this question as I'm certain now that the problem is the interaction between modern Macs and my Cisco switch. I can kind of fix the problem by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Setting the Mac ethernet \"hardware\" tab to manual 1000T/full duplex\n\n*Setting corresponding switch ports to 1000T/full duplex\n\n*Turning off the switch green ethernet facility\n\n*Making sure switch is at the latest firmware release\nThis seems to work well until the Mac sleeps, then the connection is lost again. I'm still trying to work out how to work around that issue.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open a Terminal window\n\n*type cd /Library/Preferences/System\\ Configuration\n\n*type open .\n\n*Find the NetworkInterfaces.plist\n\n*Trash it\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Go to Network and it will automatically find your wired connection\n\n", "Q: How do you install a graphics card on mac pro 1,1?

The colors are too much for him/her to handle.\nEDIT: Ideally I'm looking to assign a keyboard shortcut or create a desktop icon.\n\nA: As of Sierra you can tell Siri to ‘use grayscale’, the closest thing to a shortcut I’ve been able to discover so far.\n\nA: Yes, this can be achieved with AppleScript and Automator.\nThe setting to automate is located in:\nSystem Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Use Greyscale\nThe keyboard combination option + command + F5 also shows Accessibility options.\nThis Apple discussion, Keyboard shortcut for \"Use grayscale\", shows how to use AppleScript and Automator to create a menu bar item that toggles the Greyscale on/off.\n\nA: You can grayscale the display from the accessibility settings, but it's a real pain if you want to temporarily enable/disable it. I have made an app to solve this problem. It allows you to toggle grayscale mode from the status bar. \nTested to work on macOS Mojave. \nYou can download it from here. The source code is here. \nNote: Due to Apple's restrictions you need to allow it to have accessibility and system events permissions.  \n\nA: Based on a few StackExchange posts (mostly the credit goes to RecursivelyIronic), I have packaged a solution with instructions into a GitHub repository: macOS-grayscale.\nIt requires compiling a binary, which can then be assigned a hotkey combination (instructions in the repo).\nOn plus side it:\n\n*\n\n*toggles fairly quickly\n\n*doesn’t cause a popup\n\n*doesn’t interfere with color inversion\n\n*works on Catalina\n\n", "Q: Got app approved and \"pending contract\", but no buttons appear in Bank, Tax information The app status says that the \"App approved, but one or more of your contracts is not yet in effect\". So I went to the bank, tax information module: in here is a Request Contracts list, which shows one line for \"Paid Apps\" and one for \"iAds\". Next to it, my name stands as Legal Entity. There is a button \"Request\" on each line - but when I click it, it only shows my personal home address data in a simple form (but no bank accounts, no tax information etc.). Nothing else to click, nothing else to check, nothing else to view. Nothing. And there are no \"Set Up\" buttons either like shown in their video tutorial. No other buttons. I can do nothing here.\nIs this just Apple doing administrative tasks on their side and I should just wait? Maybe it's because I'm fairly new as I registered this month (3 weeks ago) as an Apple developer...\n\nA: Ok, this is ridiculous, but I accidentally found the solution: when clicking the \"Request\" button in the Taxes/Contracts module a form popped up displaying my address data. No agreement, contract texts, however. \nThen I clicked \"Save\" to confirm this address data. Nothing happened, the form stayed. \nThen I clicked \"Save\" again. \nAnd again. \nAnd again. \nAnd again. \nAfter the 5th time of clicking \"Save\" in a row - suddenly the agreement and contract window appeared!!! \nApple, you must be kidding! Really! I can reproduce this weird mechanic anytime.

My devices, including airport stations, keep being assigned a number following their name (i.e. \"ATV (3)\"). I was hoping Mavericks would fix it but it did not.\nIs this fixable, please?\n\nA: This seems like a problem with your router. Try forcing your hostname with scutil:\nscutil --set HostName yourhostname\n\nWhy the number?\nThe bracketed numbers appear because the same Bonjour/ZeroConf name is being used multiple times on the network. If Bonjour detects a duplicate name, a number is appended to ensure uniqueness.\nThis does not indicate a serious problem. Resetting network caches and devices should help clear out the now superseded name.\nApple's Bonjour Frequently Asked Questions page discusses this behaviour:\n\n12. What should happen when two devices on the network both use the same service name?\nIn the rare case where a name collision occurs, your device should add\n  a digit to the end of the name, for example:\n\"Apple Mac mini (2)\"\n\n", "Q: Adding \"Delete\" and/or \"Mark as read\" to mail notifications in Mavericks By default maill.app notifications has two buttons. One for replying to the email and the other one for closing the notification. This is very nice, although, I was wondering if there is any way that I can add either (or both) of the \"Delete\" and \"Mark as read\" buttons to the mail notifications. Applescript, hacking some settings, third party apps or any other ways are fine, however, I prefer some native built-in solutions.\n\nA: There is a free app called Herald which does have a Mark As Read button which I have used for a bit now and I can recommend as a stop-gap.\nI dug around some plist files to see if anything related to this already exists. No luck, sadly. I also sent feedback to Apple using the link grgarside provided, if others do the same it may actually result in something!\n\nA: This is currently not possible in Mail's preferences.

Would it be the date modified of the least recently modified file? Does moving it to the trash count as modifying it?\n\nA: Whilst the last emptied date is not stored, it does update the last modification date. Therefore, providing you have not added anything to a trash since, the last modification date of each .Trashes will be the last time that trash was emptied.\n", "Q: Erasing iPhone and backup I've got iPhone 4S and I wanna sell it...I have backed up contacts on http://icloud.com ...Does contacts remain on http://icloud.com after reseting all iPhone settings?\n\nA: Yes, the contacts remain in iCloud. However, once you reset the iPhone to factory settings, the iPhone is no longer logged in to your iCloud account which means that there are no contacts appearing on the iPhone whatsoever. \nYou can further log in to your iCloud account on your computer via a web browser (icloud.com) and erase the contacts from there if you wish. \n\nA: Yes, the contacts you have backed up to iCloud will remain after using the “Erase all the content and settings” feature on your iPhone.\nTo fully erase an iPhone to avoid important data being recovered for illegal usage, see the guide:\n5 Methods to Erase iPhone Completely and Securely\nIf you want to delete the contacts in your iCloud account, see the “Delete backups and turn off Backup for your device” section in this guide:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4847\n", "Q: OPEN RECENT FILE command vanished in Word for Mac Office 2008 I am running OS Maverick 10.9.3 on my Mac Book Pro and have worked happily on Office 2008 through several versions of OSX.

I can drag a tab out of window, and it becomes independent window in Safari, Finder and other apps that support tabs. Is it possible to reverse this operation, convert window into tab by dragging it to another window?\n\nA: You can just hit cmd + shift + T to make the tab bar visible in any finder window. This allows you to drag the current window as a tab into any other finder window.\n\nA: You need to drag a tab - Safari won't let you drag an entire window into another one.  You can hit ⌘T to create a new empty tab (thus making the tab interface visible), then drag your original tab to the other window.\n\nA: Go to Window → Merge All Windows. In Safari, this merges other windows into the currently active window. In Finder, this merges the current windows into other window.\nAlternatively, you can show the tab bar with View → Show Tab Bar. This lets you drag the tab when only one tab in a window is open.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Just drag the tab of the new window in the right location of the old window, and it is done. In this way you can also drag-n-drop tabs of safari between different open windows.\nI know it works in Chrome like this\n", "Q: Photo thumbnails remain in camera roll after moving photos to computer I'm exporting my photos to my computer by connecting my iPhone 5S (iOS 7.1.1) to my Ubuntu 14.04 setup and cutting the photos from the DCIM folder and pasting them on my computer.\nThe photos go through alright, but the camera roll still shows the thumbnails. When I click on the thumbnail I get a white blank screen.\nHow come?\nHow can I move photos out of the phone without keeping its thumbnail in the camera roll? \n\nA: A hacky and maybe risky workaround which worked for me was suggested here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to PhotoData folder\n\n*Delete Photos.sqlite\n\n*Restart the iPhone\n\n\nA: Why is this happening: because deleting the picture from DCIM has no effect on the database listing the pictures neither to the thumbnails generated during the capture of the picture. Once the DCIM empty the DB points to void placeholders.\nHow to do otherwise: try rebooting the iPhone. Next time delete them form the device or use some 3rd party softs.\n\nA: Well, I did that, too, deleting Photos.sqlite file.\nBut then when I wanted to look at the thumbnails in the Camera Roll (accessed through running the Camera app) - nothing was there, and it said \"Rebuilding Thumbnails\" or something, and it took a while. And then all the thumbnails were there. Except one:\nI couldn't see a thumbnail of a photo I took while this \"rebuilding process\" was going on.\n(However, it is there in the Photos app.)\nNow, that this process is complete it seems that the new photos result in new thumbnails. And I see them appear in the /private/var/mobile/Media/PhotoData/Thumbnails/ folder.\nAlso, just as an aside, deleting Photos.sqlite doesn't delete all the old thumbnails. And while they are small, they do end up taking some space on the iPhone storage unit.\n\nA: Looking around under:\necho afc://$(idevice_id -l)/PhotoData\n\nFor the aforementioned sqlite files, I found the thumbnail files themselves and separate EXIF data  (as *.JPG, *.THM) in folders under it at:\n./Metadata/DCIM/1??APPLE\n./Thumbnails/*  # left thumbnailConfiguration\n\nI deleted the Photos.sqlite* files, changes*, and the non-config files from folder listed above.

It's intended to let you know what apps are using the network at what times, but you can use it's permission function to deny internet access for all apps except the ones you care about.  \nYou can download it for free, it will work for 3 hours before you have to turn it back on again.  Or you can purchase the full version so that it's not time limited.\nI have no affiliation with it, other than being a satisfied customer.\nEDIT: additionally, it will let you setup different deny/allow profiles so that you can set it up once and then just \"flip the switch\" next time.\n", "Q: How to choose keys in keychain access? I would like keychain access to store all my keys and passwords for my ssh accesses.\nHowever, if I store too many keys, I get \"Too Many Authentication Failures\" since SSH will try to send all keys and passwords.\nIs there a way to choose which key or password to send?\n\nA: Put your per-server SSH-configuration into ~/.ssh/config like this:\nHost useKeyOnly.net\nuser sshuser \nIdentityfile ~/.ssh/mykey1\nIdentitiesOnly yes\n\nHost usePasswordOnly.org\nPubkeyAuthentication no\nPort 53221\nuser root\n\n", "Q: How can I disable a root certificate in iOS?

The voice memos will show in the Voice Memos playlist.\n\nA: The voice memos do not appear under \"voice memos\" playlist as expected; instead, they appeared when I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click My Device > Music\n\n*Scroll down the list of individual audio files/songs and voila, there were my memos mixed in with the others.\n\n\nFor some unknown reason, the voice memos did not end up in \"Voice Memos\" playlist automatically; but they can be moved there to that playlist manually.\n", "Q: My Xcode build requires cURL 8.0.0 or later (which doesn't exist) I'm writing a C program in Xcode that uses cURL. It builds properly on my Mac Pro running 10.8.5, but on my MacBook Pro running 10.8.5, it gives me this error when I try to build:\ndyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/curl/lib/libcurl.4.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Users/AlecZ/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/UPServer2-folctfcnmdhllzbddscwimqrggig/Build/Products/Debug/UPServer2\n  Reason: Incompatible library version: UPServer2 requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libcurl.4.dylib provides version 7.0.0\n\nThe latest cURL is 7.37.0, so I don't see how it could require 8.0.0. I have run into similar issues before when trying to compile software for Linux from its source, the compiler stating that I need a nonexistent version of some library.\nI have already run brew install libcurl, but it says that I can't replace the system library for cURL.\n\nA: Try reinstalling curl package, e.g.\nbrew update\nbrew reinstall curl libcurl\n\nThis should fix the broken dependencies.\nIf this won't help, then try to comment out or remove any DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH references from the startup shell scripts (e.g. ~/.bash_profile).\n\nA: This is probably not the best solution, but I remembered this just as I was asking the question. After running brew install libcurl, I moved everything except pkgconfig from /usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.37.0/lib into /usr/lib, replacing old files. So I'm still at version 7.37.0, but it compiles properly now. I don't know what the compiler error was trying to say.\n", "Q: Can you passlock specific Apps on an iPhone? I know the easiest way to secure your iPhone is by using a 4-digit-passcode to lock the entire phone. However, I was wondering if there is a way to securely passcode-protect only the Photo and Mail apps, i.e. a passcode is required every time the apps are opened? \nMy iPhone is not jailbroken and I'm not planning on doing so.\n\nA: Individual apps from the App Store can't be passcode protected in this way without jailbreaking which you mentioned you don't want to do. You may be able to use restrictions, but you will need to go to Settings each time to enable/disable access, and restrictions are only available for certain pre-installed apps and features.\n", "Q: Looking for a black/white only terminal emulator on Mac My original question on Stack Overflow can be found here.

I need to have a case sensitive file system. I am planning to create a separate data partition for that. 100GB (Mac/home directory) + 151GB (data partition). I have a habit of making a separate data partition since my Linux days (while building a new system). It seems like the separate data partition appears as /Volumes/data_partition on Mac, while it appears as /data_partition (as in, direct descendant of / ) for Linux. Is my understanding correct?\nWhat kind of Formatting should I use for the separate partition? Again, I want to make it case sensitive, and it needs to work with Linux too. Is \"Case-Sensitive, Journaled\" okay?\nMy first preference is a separate partition, but do you recommend a dmg (not sure about advantage/disadvantage) in stead of separate partition? Any major disadvantage of using a separate data partition? I am assuming it will be slightly slow considering it’s a different partition. My MBR has an SSD, so I am assuming it shouldn’t be too bad.\nPlease note this partition will only be used to hold data (not as a boot partition as I am not planning for dual boot). \nThanks in advance!!!\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you are correct. /Volumes/(name) is the mount point.\n\n*Mac OS Extended (Case-Sensitive, Journaled) is the best case-sensitive option. I'm assuming you know what you're doing with case-sensitive partitions.\n\n*The biggest disadvantage, maybe, of creating a separate partition is that you can't use Boot Camp if you have more than one partition on your startup disk before partitioning for Boot Camp, meaning that you can't use Boot Camp at all if you only have one hard drive on your Mac. You said that you want the separate partition for Linux; do you mean that you're going to run Linux in Boot Camp?\n\n", "Q: How to install boot camp without Windows cd? I'm trying to install boot camp on my MacBook Pro, problem is I don't have a windows installation disk. Can someone please explain how to install bootcamp without the cd? Please!\n\nA: Are you missing the physical media and only have an ISO of the Windows CD or do you not even have that? An ISO and an 8GB thumb drive is all you really need. Just launch the Boot Camp app and follow the prompts.\nBoot Camp is basically the glue that allows Windows to install on a Mac. And by glue I mean the installation utilities and drivers.\nUsing Boot Camp without Windows is kind of like using an oil filter without the car to plug it into: it has no function all by itself, it only works in concert with another part. In the case of the oil filter, it needs a car or other vehicle. In the Case of Boot Camp, it needs Windows.\n\nA: It's entirely possible to install Windows without using BootCamp, since all BootCamp does is makes things easier by giving you a handy wizard that does most of grunt work for you (partitioning the drive, drivers, etc.)  So if you need to install Windows in a manner that the BootCamp wizard doesn't support, just don't use it.\nAll you have to do is shrink your Mac partition in Disk Utility and then create a MS-DOS FAT32 partition.  You can reformat it NTFS during the Windows install later, but creating the FAT32 partition is important.  It's what creates the hybrid MBR on the drive.  If you don't do it, Windows will destroy your Mac partition during the install.\nAfter you've got the partition in place, just pop in whatever media you have Windows on and install it the way you would on a PC.  You can download the BootCamp drivers from Apple's web site.\n\nIf, however, you mean that you do not have any Windows install media at all, then you misunderstand what BootCamp is for.  BootCamp's only job is to help you install a copy of Windows that you already own onto your Mac.  BootCamp does not contain a copy of Windows, nor does it contain a Windows license.  You are still required to legally purchase a copy of Windows to install on your Mac.\n", "Q: If I mess up the EFI System Partition, will Mac OS X be unbootable? I forgot to make a backup of my EFI System Partition (ESP) and  have installed grub onto it.\nIf I happen to accidentally mess up the partition, will OS X be bootable? If not, how would I restore the EFI System Partition without having a backup?\n\nA: If it happens you mess it up, you can download it from Apple.\nEFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Macs\nThis article lists firmware updates that were released for Intel-based Macs. They update the firmware that originally shipped from the factory. If your computer isn't on this list, then you don't need an update to the factory firmware.\n", "Q: What Thunderbolt to USB 3.0 cables/adapters exist for OS X and Mac hardware? I have the Late 2013 Macbook Pro, which has two USB 3.0 ports and two Thunderbolt 2 ports. I currently use both USB 3.0 ports and one TB2 port. I want to connect a third USB 3.0 device to the machine, but I don't want to use a USB splitter on one USB port as I'm concerned the devices would draw too much power from the bus. I have no current use for the second TB2 port and I would love to be able to use it for this purpose. \nBrowsing extensively online, I've found numerous docks, such as Belkin's Thunderbolt Express, that connect via a Thunderbolt cable. This would work, but it's an expensive, 'bulkier' solution (and not the one I'm looking for). \nI'm aware that a USB 3.0 device wouldn't be able to take advantage of Thunderbolt's I/O speeds, but it's certainly compatible, which is all I'd need. After all, Apple even sells a Thunderbolt to Firewire Adapter. I also know that Thunderbolt is not only used for digital video purposes (along with the TB > Firewire option, there exists Thunderbolt External Hard Drives). \nThere are almost no Thunderbolt to USB 3.0 cables/adapters on the market. I'd think this hardware would be more prevalent given the prominence of USB devices out there. What adapters are available for OS X?\n\nA: As a matter of fact \"Kanex\" the only company I know of that offers \"true\" adapters put their Thunderbolt to eSATA + USB 3.0 adapter on the market 18 hours ago, at a price point of 69.95$\n\nA: Thunderbolt and USB are quite different protocols, so you can't just use a cable -- it would need to have active electronics in it to convert between the protocols. And that means it would cost a lot more than a cheap commodity USB hub and so no one would buy it -- they'd just get a hub instead. If you're concerned about the power drain, get a powered USB hub.\n\nA: I also ended up looking for good solutions. Thunderbolt 2 supports 20 Gb/s. So it could provide enough reserves for a real usb 3 hub where every port could finally run 5 Gb/s = 640 MB/s. \nAs a single SSD already exceeds the speed of a USB 3 connection, we should not put them through a USB 3 Hub bottleneck to not enforce slowing the transfer rates down.\nActually there are some companies that already considered these issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highpoint offers an Thunderbolt 2 to 4 port USB3 Hub http://www.highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/series_Thunderbolt_Overview.htm, a dock with 2 SAS Ports and a dock with 3 PCI card slots & 4 SSD bays etc. \n\n*Sonnet has a great Dock with an USB 3 HUB & 2 SSD bays http://www.sonnettech.com/product/echo15prothunderboltdock.html and some other good thunderbolt docks with PCIe card slots for USB3 etc.\nOther good manufacturers to check out:\n\n\n*\n\n*Promise\n\n*OWC \n\n*G-Technology\n\n\nAll in all going for thunderbolt 2 is always on the much more expensive side of the table.\n\nA: So, I believe the main reason these cables/adapters don't exist is explained in your question, actually. That is, the fact that many, if not all, devices that come with a Thunderbolt port, also already have one or more USB 3.0 ports.\nIf your primary concern is simply power draw on the bus, I'd recommend simply buying a powered USB 3.0 hub.\n\nA: I have found the solution to my problem. I've got an eight port USB hub by Akasa, self powered. I connected four controllers, a sound card and two liscenses to it, while I use an USB 3.0 hub for my external drives. Works like a charm.\n\nA: Thunderbolt T2 and USB3 are compatible as Apple device components. Market-place adapters may no work so well. Say you want to swap data from your Mac to the HP-PC business customer. \nApple-only T2 HighPoint RocketStar with 10 Gbps data transfer is no help, because half-speed PC's lack Thunderbolt technology. Universal UB3 StarTech STSDOCK2U33 may 'seem' more promising. Consider that fact that Mac/PC swap drive formatting is very tenuous. \nAssuming anyone wants an external drive dock for a Mac, the only pro for half-speed StarTech over faster RocketStar is saving $136… Forget the swappable desktop drive dock idea, if possible. Why swap out data using a drive dock? USB is the best way for Mac/PC users to swap and co-produce compatible Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud data files.\nCan you swap a external hard drive between Mac and pc without affecting it?\n", "Q: Converting publisher files for use on Mac I have Microsoft publisher files on a windows computer.  I recently purchased a macbook air, and would like to move these files to my new computer.  How do I do that?\n\nA: LibreOffice 4.0 and later can open publisher files.\n\nA: As others have mentioned there is no Mac application that can work with Publisher files.\n(EDIT: As Tom pointed out LibreOffice 4.0 and above, released in February 2013, can now open and work with Publisher files)\nWhat I've recommended for people at our office who have made the switch to Mac is to either export to a different format (Word, PDF, etc) from Publisher on their PC beforehand.\nAlternately you can use online services to convert the Publisher file into a PDF, Word doc, etc.  I know there are several but the only I've actually used is the service from Zamzar.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: How can I get full resolution out of different generations of cinema displays? I have a newer thunderbolt display and an older Apple Cinema HD display hooked up to my retina macbook pro (15 inch, early 2013, 1 GB GeForce GT 650M graphics card). The older one is going through a mini-displayport interface to a dvi cable hooked up to a thunderbolt port, while the newer one is on thunderbolt.\nHowever, I've only been able to get as high as 1280 by 800 resolution out of the older monitor.

So until someone finds a lasting solution the workaround happens to be quite useful.\nIt's interesting that files residing in the same directory but copied from a windows machine never get metadata.\n\nA: This is a common issue which happens when the file's type and creator attributes are modified by Finder when its writing files, if these attributes aren't restored back to the original values by Finder at the end of its write action, those files won't be accessible to the user. \nRunning this command will remove the creator and type attributes set by Finder,\nSetFile -c \"\" -t \"\" path/to/file.mov\n\nNote: If the above command is not found, try installing Xcode command line tool and try the above command again,\nxcode-select --install\n\n\nA: You won't be able to run Repair Disk on a Windows NTFS filesystem, and NTFS volumes cannot be indexed by Spotlight unless Paragon NTFS or Tuxera NTFS have been installed because Spotlight needs to write its index files to the volume.\nI suggest you move these movie files to an HFS+ volume, either to the local HD, or to an external HD formatted with HFS+. You may be able to play the movies with Paragon NTFS or Tuxera NTFS installed, but it may be easier just to transfer the file to a Mac filesystem. If you want to edit these files, you will need to transfer them.\n\nA: I don't have enough reputation to comment, but adding to the great answers above, I navigated to the drive and used a command listed above to clear out the finder info that was added: \ncd /Volumes/[drive name]\nxattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo *\n\nand then had to tell spotlight not to index that drive (NTFS formatted drive).\nThis was a good resource — http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/24/stop-spotlight-from-indexing-time-machine-backup-volumes-external-drives/\n\nA: Some optimization on the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*On terminal enter:\ncd /Volumes/DriveName\n\nSetFile -c \"\" -t \"\" */*\n\n\n*The last command can be arranged as script running automatically on disc mounting. Use you search engine on that.\n\nA: maybe spotlight was indexing the disk.\nalso it may be a problem caused by the no mac filesystem.\ndo the movies work as expected if you connect the harddrive to a PC?\n", "Q: how do i erase all info on macbook air while still keeping microsoft word I received a  macbook with unwanted materials on it and i would like to start anew, but i need Microsoft Word for college. I am to afraid to try anything in fear of erasing the program. Please help.\n\nA: Your best bet for a clean slate would be to wipe the drive and reinstall OS X. However, if you really need to keep Microsoft Word you might want to try other options.\nFor data that the old owner did not delete, you can create yourself an account on the machine (Administrator) and delete their account. \n\nThen, using Disk Utility, you can \"erase free space\" to actually delete the data.\n\nAs for the rest of the stuff on the drive, such as installed applications that you don't want, you will need to manually remove these from /Applications. I suggest that you don't simply delete the .app files from that directory, but run them through a 3rd party uninstaller such as AppCleaner.\nThis is a lot less \"clean\" than reinstalling OS X, but it does what you want.\n\nA: You can buy a little flash drive with an amazing amount of GB - and there's your answer.\n", "Q: Windows on a Macbook Pro with integrated Intel Iris Pro only I've been wondering about this since the last refresh of the Macbook Pro range...I have a need to run some Windows-only software, and I've read in the past that many people complained about lower battery life running Windows under Bootcamp on their Macbooks. This turned out to be the result of the Discrete Graphics Card always enabled for Windows, with no way to only use the integrated GPU. \nI see now with the last refresh, that Apple have a Macbook Pro Retina with an Intel Iris Pro only option (no discrete GPU). Would it be reasonable to assume that I could get better battery life out of this new Macbook option under Bootcamp, than with previous Macbook Pro iterations? I'm certainly aware that Windows is nowhere nearly as optimised as OSX, and hence will not not be able to claim the same battery sipping status of it.\nI work a lot on Magento and Drupal site development, and occasionally develop the odd nopCommerce (.NET based) project under Windows. I also make use of Adobe Photoshop CC for slicing up web designs handed over to me, and fool around in Sketchup every now and then. I don't play games on my laptop...purely work. So I believe that my graphics processing needs are very small.\nOk, I've gone off course a little, but getting back to the main question - Would it be reasonable to assume that I can achieve slightly better battery consumption by choosing the Retina Macbook Pro with Intel Iris Pro only option?\n\nA: I have no sources other than personal experience to back up my claims, but I recommend the machine without the dGPU if you will be spending the majority of your time in Windows. \nI have seen the difference, and the dGPU kills the battery in Windows. My machine with an integrated GPU gets significantly better battery life under Windows than another machine with a dedicated GPU. In fact, the machine with the integrated chip gets almost equivalent battery life under both Windows and OS X.\nYou may want to stick with the dGPU if you need it for 3D gaming or media applications that perform better with a dedicated chip. \nIn the end of the day, it is really up to you, but you will probably get better battery life without the dGPU. I have seen an hour and half difference in some cases.\n", "Q: How does Finder decide whether a file extension needs to be hidden? I'm using Mavericks and I noticed some of my files have their extensions hidden and others don't. How does Finder decide whether a file extension needs to be hidden?\nI know I can prevent this inconsistency by selecting the \"Show all filenames extensions\" option in Finder Preferences.\n\nA: Finder doesn't decide this - it is a flag saved with the file. The app saving the file sets or clears this flag.

Oddly enough, you can mount it as RW using a SDXC > USB adapter (don't ask my why, but it works) such as this. Once mounted, you can copy data off the card. It's not a question of a corrupted filesystem, but a physical failure of the device - for example, although you will be able to reformat the card when connected via this adapter, it will nevertheless revert back to read only if connected directly again; it will eventually fail completely.

In iOS 7/8 is it \"allowed\" for an app to change the internal clock?\nI want to write an app that would automate th process of going to settings>general>date & time then turning off \"automatically set time\"  and changing the date to tomorrow. Then later turning back on \"automatically set date and time\". \nIs this kind of tinkering allowed in iOS 7 or 8? \n\nA: No.\nSource: This Stack Overflow answer.\nMakes sense. Apple hardly allows apps to modify system-level stuff. It's easy to guess that the heavy sandboxing also means they cannot touch something as crucial as system time. Many things depend on the system time and even if Apple allowed apps to do that, it would take a lot of effort to make sure it worked without messing up other processes.\n", "Q: Disk partition interrupted So I was partitioning my macbook's hard disk so as to install addition operating system. \nBut as disk utility was in the process of partitioning, I closed the disk partition (for a reason) thinking it wont save the changes and I will start again. \nBig mistake. \nAll the free space (a lot) I had before is now showing as \"other\" and the disk isn't partitioned. How do I fix this? Thanks!\n\nA: If the formerly-free space is showing up as 'other', the implication is that your current system partition is perfectly OK?\nI would recommend to start with, booting from the Recovery partition, and doing a 'Verify Disk' and/or 'Repair Disk' on the system partition.\nIs the 'other' space actually a partition, or is it free unpartitioned space on the drive?\nIf it's a partition, you can use Disk Utility to select that partition and use 'Erase' it in the format you wanted - give it the name you want at the same time.\nIf not, you can just create the new partition in that space.\n", "Q: I would like to delete all the contents on my Iphone but the LCD and touch sensitivity is gone.

Namely, is it possible to setup a networked Time Machine to backup the Desktops of 11 workstations on a LAN.\nWhile I'm familiar with OSX, I haven't attempted to setup Time Machine until today.\nI work with a group of professional photographers/videographers/graphic artists that regularly produce a large volume of products. They already have a large (ie 30+TB) NAS they use to archive old projects but there are cases where some deliverables were accidentally deleted prior to backup.\nThe Hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Mac Mini loaded with Mavericks\n\n*OSX Server\n\n*5TB of SAN\n\n\nThe Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load OSX Server on the Mini\n\n*Mount the SAN via iSCSI\n\n*Partition the SAN with 2 Volumes, Storage & Backup with a 3:1 ratio\n\n*Setup OSX to backup using Time Machine\n\n*Create one folder for each workstations desktop on the Storage volume\n\n*Share the Storage volume via SMB\n\n\nNote: iSCSI allows the OS to transparently mount a networked SAN as a local disk.\nOn the workstations I'll create symbolic links to replace the user's local Desktop folder with the Desktop folder on the network drive.\nThen, if a file is lost somebody can remote into the Mac Mini and wind back the Time Machine to recover any lost files.\nThe Mini will be dedicated to this and sharing printers alone so I don't think the backups will overwhelm the server. The SAN will be configured in a of Raid50 array with 2 drive redundancy. This setup will reside on a trusted, private, air-gapped network so security isn't an issue. All network connections are hard-wired.\nAre there any special Time Machine quirks/limitations that I need to look out for before I invest the time and effort to build this beast?\n\nA: I don't think you need to have one folder per workstation - each backup will be created in a .sparsebundle file, that is mounted by the remote workstation that belongs to it, and used as the backup disk.\nAt home I have a Mac Mini running OS X Server, and I also back up my MacBook Pro and my wife's MacBook Pro to it over WiFi. It works well, and apart from the size of the disk I imagine it would scale just fine.\n\nA: I'm interested in a similar solution as the one you're describing, and from what I've read, this may be of interest for your setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no native iSCSI initiator on OS X. There are alternatives. Xsan looks like the standard on OS X but I'm at a loss there.\n\n*The Time Machine share or volume has to be set as AFP in order to work (you mention SMB, although it appears to be for storage purposes).\n\n*OS X Server allows for Time Machine quotas and Yosemite clients will follow them (older OS X's won't). If the computers backing up to your server are older than 10.10.x they will eat all the available space with their Time Machine backups. One solution may be setting up multiples volumes, one for each Time Machine backup as to enforce the quota, or as you suggested, at least separating storage from backup on different volumes.\n\n*If the backups are encrypted, only the owner –or a third person with the encryption password– will be able to see the contents of the .sparsebundle, so no need to put each backup on a different folder for that specific situation.\n\n*Your proposed setup of the desktop (or any other user folder) to reside on the server and later being redirected via symlinks is not needed for the backup; simply configure each user to back up to the Mac Mini setting it up as a Time Machine destination with OS X Server. Then each user may enter Time Machine at will on their own systems, without the need to remotely login to the server and start Time Machine there.\n\n*You can –if you wish– setup Network User accounts on OS X Server and have something like what you described: users having all their data stored on the server and accessing it no matter what computer they are using. A very good explanation and setup instructions can be found in this Ars Technica article.\n\n", "Q: iMac late 2009, Screen mess up - black windows Yesterday I was working on my iMac 27\" Late 2009 with OS X Mavericks 10.9, suddenly Google Chrome's tabs started to flicker.

I didn't realize missing horizontal scrolling would be such an issue, but apparently it is. \nNow a mac does support horizontal scrolling by holding shift + scrolling, this is however amazingly slow. \nI have the Logitech Control Center installed, which offers a few extra options, but nothing regarding the horizontal scroll speed. The scrolling speed options offered there only affect vertical scrolling.\n\nCan the vertical speed be one setting and the horizontal speed another?\n\nA: I think Logitech has updated their mouse scroll settings since this answer was asked, and now their settings allow you to adjust horizontal scroll speed. Yay!\nI recently (April 2020) bought a Logitech M705 mouse, and once you plug its little usb receiver into your computer for the first time you've got the option to install the \"Logi Options\" app, which contains a bunch of adjustable settings for your Logitech devices.\n\n*\n\n*Open the Logi Options app\n\n*Select your mouse\n\n*You'll see horizontal scroll speed options.\n\n\n\nA: You can make the horizontal scroll speed faster and independent by overriding the native ⇧+scroll function with SteerMouse's feature to define a custom relationship between inputs, scroll speed, and direction.

I want them not to be created in the first place.\nEdit: I prefer a 'native' OS X solution over third party apps.\nEdit: This questions has two answers, one for the ._ files and one for the .DS_Store files. The bounty is rewarded for dot_clean, this native command line app cleans all ._ files. Unfortunately is does not clear the .DS_Store files, this can effectively be done with Asepsis. Asepsis stores .DS_Stores in a fixed location, and not in the folder itself.\n\nA: The ._ files are AppleDouble files that are used to store metadata like extended attributes, ACLs, file flags, and resource forks.\nTo delete them, run:\nfind . -name ._\\* -delete\n\nYou can see if files have extended attributes, ACLs, or file flags with ls -l@eO. The ._ files are usually created because files have extended attributes. You can use xattr -c to delete extended attributes or chmod -N to delete ACLs. cp -X and rsync copy files without extended attributes, ACLs, file flags, or resource forks.\n\nA: As you would have to disable writing of hidden files on every Mac that could connect to your share, a better option would be to stop this at the share and not on the clients.\nAll you need to do is to edit your share config (for example in Linux in /etc/samba/smb.conf) and add the following option into your share config:\nveto files = /._*/.DS_Store/ \n\nNow no Mac clients can save any files with those patterns to your share.\n\nA: I will admit, I hadn't noticed that the defaults write command stopped working in Mavericks.\nHowever, when I DO clean network mounts, instead of your one liner find and rm, I use this:\ndot_clean .\n\nThe manfile explains:\ndot_clean -- Merge ._* files with corresponding native files.\n\nI don't use the -m flag, but you may find it helpful in your situation.\n-m      Always delete dot underbar files.\n\nHere is another person actively trying to stop .DS_Store files from being created:\nhttp://www.aorensoftware.com/blog/2011/12/24/death-to-ds_store/ - looks like he doesn't want them on drives as much as he doesn't want them on the network!\n\nA: I have not tried this myself, and I realize the OP prefers native solutions, but nonetheless:\nThere's an app called Asepsis that works by redirecting creation of those files into a special folder, i.e. in a way preventing them from appearing.\n\nA: Not a native solution, nor does it actually prevent these files being written, but it does actively chase after them & delete as soon as they are written…\nBlueHarvest\n\nBlueHarvest automatically removes .DS_Store and ._ AppleDouble files from your USB keys, SD cards, music players, file servers or any non Mac disk. BlueHarvest removes these items as they’re created or modified so you’ll always be metadata free without you needing to lift a finger.\n\nNo affiliation, I've just been using it quite successfully for several years.\n\nA: Just tried, and this does work in Mavericks (at least for disabling .DS_Store not network shares):\ndefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores -bool true\n\nYou just need to remember to restart Finder as well:\nkillall Finder\n\n\nA: As far as I know you can not prevent that these files will be created. At least the Finder will create them.\nDeleting these files will not help too - because the next time you access the volume and its folders on Mac, the Finder will create them again.\nI am astonished that your Windows colleagues see these files. I am working for many years now with my Mac using Mac and Windows - and I never see these files. Neither on Mac nor on Windows.\nThese files are marked as \"hidden\" by default, and will not appear if you have Windows set to hide hidden files and folders.\n\nA: I found a very easy and free way to get rid go ._ files, especially from an external fat32 HD.\nLaunch OnyX (free software). From Utilities, go to AppleDouble, select... the folder. Thats it!!!\n", "Q: Virus Scan Windows 8 Bootcamp Partition from OS X? Is there any software I can use to scan a bootcamp partition on OSX for viruses from OS X?\nI prefer to run the scan from OS X because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Typically Windows anti-virus solutions are more like full suites that\nrequire an installation. I do not wish to install anything like that\nbecause it would incur a performance penalty. \n\n*As I understand it, running the scan from outside the OS you're\nscanning means that anything potentially malicious on the OS won't\ninterfere with the scan.\nI suppose I could use a bootdisk of some kind but that is difficult because some bootdisks are not compatible with macbooks. \nSo I figure if OSX is already hosting/aware of the Windows partition I should be able to easily scan it from OSX right?\n\nA: Two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not sure of any good Mac solution that will have the coverage of Windows viruses that Windows tools such as Security Essentials do. ClamAV may have pretty good signatures, but I can't vouch for whether it does or does not have a comparable scan and fix ability to a commercial product. Mac virus scan programs may be better, but again, they would probably have more focus on Mac viruses.\n\n*By default, NTFS partitions are not writable on Mac OS X. You therefore could detect, but not fix or remove, viruses from your Windows partition. The only way around this is to purchase a commercial product such as Paragon NTFS, or go through some interesting challenges to get open-source drivers to mount the partition read-write.\nIf you use Microsoft's offline version of Security essentials (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline) and your Mac is reasonably new, you should be able to make a bootable USB drive that will work - just insert it and hold down Option as you power on your Mac. \n\nA: I would like to vote for ClamXAv (http://www.clamxav.com) too. I am using this software since many years, and I am very happy with it. On 10.9 it found the Genieo software and helped me to remove it.\nIt would be new to me, that this great free application has a focus on Mac viruses. May be fdmillion can give us some facts?\nWhether you can use it for removing viruses depends on your Mac OS system: if you are using Mac OS X 10.6 and a FAT-32 Windows partion / volume, then you scan a Win volume and remove files.\nAs far as I know this has changed with newer Mac / Win system: you can read Win volumes with Mac, but only read / write to Mac volumes using a Win system.\nAnother reason for me to stay on 10.6 and Win XP, because I prefer full access on Mac, but no access on Win.\n", "Q: Google Chrome mysteriously requests information from Keychain A few weeks ago, Google Chrome suddenly started to request my linkedin password from the keychain on startup, before any web page is loaded.  Every time I open the browser window, after a few seconds, the following message pops up (I remove my email address from the image):\n\nEven more annoyingly, once I click \"Deny\" the window closes only for a few seconds before re-appearing!  In total I have to click away this message between 2 and 4 times every time I start the browser (the exact number differs between runs).  Whether I try to use the browser or just let it sit idle seems to make no difference.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is Google Chrome requesting this password and how can I make it stop doing so?\n\n*How could/should I debug issues like this myself?\nThings I have tried unsuccessfully:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have remove Google Chrome from the computer and deleted the directory ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome.  After re-downloading and re-installing Chrome the message reappears.  Thus I believe the problem is not due to something contained in my configuration files.\n\n*I synchronise my settings, bookmarks, etc. via the cloud storage tied to my Google account.  Since the problem only appears on one of my computers, I don't think it has to do with my settings.  To make sure I searched for \"linkedin\" in the \"Bookmark Manager\" and the \"Cookies and site data\" pane, but there are no hits.\n\n*I tried to visit chrome://net-internals/#events quickly, so that I reach the events listing before the first keychain popup appears.  Nothing linkedin-related shows in the list.\nAfter this I couldn't think of anything else to try.  Help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: Google Chrome has the option of saving user credentials to web services. At first login, Chrome asks if credentials should be saved now, saved later, or never saved. Access to the credentials stored by Chrome, and control over these credentials, is found in the Chrome > Preferences > Settings > Show advanced settings... > Passwords and forms > Manage saved passwords link.\nUnusual web service login requests that occur on application launch, or at odd times during a browsing session, can sometimes be traced to Chrome saved credentials. When these credentials also involve the user keychain, I suggest that the credentials be deleted from both the Chrome saved passwords list as well as from any associated keychain entries. There may be multiple  keychain entries, too, which should be deleted.\nFurthermore, if you sign into your Google account in Chrome to take advantage of the syncing functions, (which can be quite useful,) you have the option of saving and syncing passwords along with other elements. Depending on your level of paranoia, you may want to shut this down or never sign into your Google account.\nPersonally, I never save any credentials to financial or medical sites, nor do I save credentials to my school's file servers and web services.\n", "Q: Is FCP X 10.1.1 hanging because of older hardware?

I also like having the deleted mails saved on the server.\n\nBut if I delete emails in trash, the emails are still visible in the web interface of Gmail but disappears on my Mail.app.\nI also tried right-clicking in the sidebar and choosing “Erase Deleted Items ...” but it does not help.\nMy IMAP settings on mail.google.com are the following:\nWhen I mark a message in IMAP as deleted:\n (x) Auto-Expunge on - Immediately update the server. (default)\n ( ) Auto-Expunge off - Wait for the client to update the server.\n\nWhen a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder:\n (x) Archive the message (default)\n ( ) Move the message to the Trash\n ( ) Immediately delete the message forever\n\n\nI tried playing with them using “Auto-Expunge off” and “Move the message to the Trash” or “Immediately delete the message forever” but it did not work either. Maybe I have not waited enough?\nSo my question is how can the old behavior be achieved? Put it in trash, review them, then delete it permanently.\nMy other IMAP accounts do not behave like this and handle the trash correctly.\n\nEdit:\nDespite my Trash is not showing any email, the \"Account Info\" (right click on any mail box in the sidebar and choose \"Get Account Info\") shows that emails exist. I also tried \"Show Deleted Messages\" from \"View\" in the menu bar, but it did not help. See the image below:\n\nThe message count equals the messages in the web interface trash.

For Excel for Windows, there's an option to search a sheet for errors and go straight to them, under the \"Find and select\" icon in the ribbon. \nExcel for Mac 2011 doesn't have a \"Find and select\" ribbon icon.\nOn a sheet without thousands of cells, how can you scan it for errors?\n\nA: Depending on what your workbook's displaying,  \nEdit > Find [#] (i.e. enter the hash sign # as your target text)\nWithin: [Workbook]\nSearch: [By Rows]\nLook in: [Values]\n \nmay be less of a pain. In most of my workbooks, the only cells displaying the hash sign are error messages, and as far as I know, all Excel error values (#DIV/0, #NAME?, #REF! etc.) display text starting with #. Even if you have dozens of hash signs in non-error cells, this will be a lot faster than having to wade through the Edit > Go To… dialog on every sheet. \nIf you want to search for errors without recalculating, you may have cells which display a calculated value that's destined to turn into an error. For example, enter =2+C4, then delete column C. If recalculation is set to manual, the cell will continue to show an unchanged value, but the formula will become =2+#REF! You can find cells in this state by changing the search parameter to Within: Formulas. This can stop recalculation from propagating a cascade of #REF! errors that takes a long while to unravel.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: It's similar to in Windows, but slightly more buried. Edit > Go To..., then click Special, then select Errors under Formulas. Then look for the selected cell in the bottom left of the screen. \n\n\nAnnoyingly there doesn't seem to be any \"Go to next\" option and it forgets the settings each time, so you need to do loads of clicks each error. If you need to check for erros often, might be worth trying to make a macro (not sure if this is possible).\n", "Q: Why files created by Kaleidoscope App are in quarantine? I like to use Kaleidoscope (v 2.1.0 - build 133.01 under Mac OS X 10.8.5) to compare 2 directories.\nBut, when I create files by copying them from a directory to another using Kaleidoscope, (e.g., when a file is missing in one of the two directories), the file is always created with an extended attribute com.apple.quarantine!\nAn exemple:\ncreation of 2 directories to compare, with a file in the first:\n$ mkdir rep1\n$ mkdir rep2\n$ echo test > rep1/test.txt\n\nchecking attributes:\n$ ls -lah rep1\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user staff   102B 26 jui 20:52 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 user staff   238B 26 jui 20:51 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 user staff     5B 26 jui 20:52 test.txt\n$ ls -lah rep2\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 user staff    68B 26 jui 20:52 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 user staff   238B 26 jui 20:51 ..\n\nSelection of the file to copy it with Kaleidoscope:\n\nCopy operation:\n\nresult of the operation on the attributes:\n$ ls -lah rep1\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user staff   102B 26 jui 20:52 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 user staff   238B 26 jui 20:51 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 user staff     5B 26 jui 20:52 test.txt\n$ ls -lah rep2\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user staff   102B 26 jui 20:55 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  7 user staff   238B 26 jui 20:51 ..\n-rw-r--r--@ 1 user staff     5B 26 jui 20:52 test.txt\n\nAs you can see, an @ was added to the attributes of test.txt in rep2, and with more investigation, it's easy to see that it's a com.apple.quarantine created because of Kaleidoscope:\n$ xattr rep2/test.txt\ncom.apple.quarantine\n$ xattr -p com.apple.quarantine rep2/test.txt \n0002;53ac6c96;Kaleidoscope;\n\n\nI now it's easy to get rid of it with xattr -r com.apple.quarantine [file] on a file or xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine [directory] on a directory, but I find this very annoying!\nHere are my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why, an extended attribute is added on my files each times they are created through Kaleidoscope (new Mac OS security for non-sandboxed apps, or anything else…)?\n\n*Is it possible to avoid this comportment, and to create files with Kaleidoscope without having a quarantine on each files?\n\n\nThanks a lot for your help and your time!\n[EDIT]\nTanks to konqui, I've now a solution to completely disable the files quarantined, but I'm looking for a more specific solution, only for Kaleidoscope… Is this possible?\nAnd is there any proof about our theories about thoses quarantine, or are they due by something else that the new security for non-sandbexed app?\nThanks a lot for your help, and thank you konqui for what you've already done.\n\nA: The system's quarantine feature is a good security measure so I would not recommend this to everyone, but if you are confident in the files you download and run on your system then one option is to disable quarantining altogether.

For others, though, this guide to creating a bootable Mavericks install medium may be helpful.\n\nA: I ended up using a second Mac to do a scan with the questionable machine booted into target disk mode.\nMy actual scanning procedure was\n0) (done before using target disk mode) update system and apps on both machines to current versions\n1) compare files on both machines using this script:\nDIRS=(Applications Library mach_kernel bin \"private/etc\" sbin usr);\n# leaving out /opt as it seems to just contain MacPorts stuff\n\nfor dir in \"${DIRS[@]}\"; do\n  # diff: recursive, just output whether files differ\n  diff -r -q --speed-large-files \"$1/$dir\" \"$2/$dir\";\ndone;\n\n1.1) I used a high-powered text editor (vim) to make sense of the output.  My basic strategy was to just organize the lines of output by the first couple of levels of the directory structure using indent-based code folding.

To do this, you boot the machine while holding down command-option-R to do an Internet Recovery.  This bypasses the disk contents and uses firmware code to install OSX from Apple's servers.  Apparently you can just plug a USB drive in and choose this as the installation target; afterwards you can boot the machine from the USB drive and run scans on the system drive.  Downside here is that this is a >5GB download, so you'd better have a fast Internet connection (or some patience).\n\n*I could have also pulled the drive out of the machine and put it into a hard drive enclosure.  The advantages here are that I wouldn't have had to use a Mac to scan it, and that I wouldn't have had to find a 9-pin-to-9-pin Firewire cable.  Of course, if I didn't use a Mac to scan it, I wouldn't have been able to use my first scanning method (the diff).\n\nA: Here is a receipe for someone already knowing Macports or willing to start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a brand new admin user, and login with it\n\n*Install the latest C compiler through Xcode\n\n*Install MacPorts: https://www.macports.org/ (2.3.0)\n\n*Install clamav (0.98.3) and chkrootkit (0.49)\n\n*Run both tools:\n/usr/bin/sudo /opt/local/bin/clamscan --bell -l ~/tmp/clam.`date +%d-%m-%Y`.log -r /\n/usr/bin/sudo /opt/local/bin/chkrootkit\n\n(When you don't know on which ice you are walking, it is safer\nto use explicit pathes).\n", "Q: Mavericks: Preview pane spontaneously reappears when switching spaces Sometime my preview pane spontaneously reappears whenever I switch to another (non full-screen) Space, e.g., with CTRL + → .

I have tried editing the IORegistry, but it appears they are read-only from the IORegistry. I've tried editing IOBluetoothFamily.kext, but bluetooth becomes unavailable after a reboot. Any suggestions to spoof or flash a new PID/VID onto the dongle?\n\nA: Full disclosure: this is purely speculation, worth a try but not intended to be the final word.\nIt would make sense that you can't change the VID/PID after the device is connected. Your idea of editing the kext may be along the right path, but from what I gather, OS X generally does not like to load modified drivers (because their signatures will no longer be correct.)\nFirst, try disabling Gatekeeper (it's the option that stops you from running non-signed apps.) It's under Security & Privacy in SysPrefs. \nIf that doesn't work, this may be worth a try, but I don't know if it'll do anything. Some versions of OS X apparently have a switch that allows loading modified drivers (normally you can't). The command is:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"kext-dev-mode=1\"\n\nThen edit your kext, and rebuilt the kext cache:\nsudo kextcache -m /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup/Extensions.mkext /System/Library/Extensions\n\n(Source: http://www.cindori.org/enabling-trim-on-os-x-yosemite/ - modifying kexts on the new OS X Beta causes them to fail to load, maybe this is still happening on older OS versions - it'd make sense, given Apple's strong security sense.)\n", "Q: Exclude apps from Spotlight results Is there a way to exclude specific apps from Spotlight search results? For example, in my daily workflow I rarely open iTunes.

Similarly, when I want the App Store, I prefer using my Launchpad dedicated Hot Corner. I'd love to Spotlight to Airmail without the extra strokes it requires to get past the App Store suggested... \nOne alternative would be third party tools, a la Quicksilver, Alfred, etc and setting up dedicated key bindings. I'm a bit of a binding junkie but hesitate with setting universal patterns that might impede applications I've overlooked. \nAs far as I can tell it seems Spotlight's search preferences are limited to the broad strokes but is it possible to hide specific apps from the results? \n\nA: Launching applications with Quicksilver the “manual” way is so fast, I’ve never even bothered assigning a keystroke for one. If you did want a keystroke, you could limit the scope so it’s not active in certain applications, or so it’s only active in certain applications.\nAlso note that Quicksilver will very quickly learn that when you type “it”, you want iTerm by default and not iTunes, so you won’t need to remove it from the results entirely. And unlike Spotlight, you can find iTerm2 by typing something like “trm”.\n", "Q: Download App Store app on one Mac to install on another?

In other words, think a dial-up modem with even higher latency. Normally, all this guy does is some basic Email and web browsing, and he's just the sort who's patient enough to deal with it. Not to mention, monopolies and ISP business dealings mean he's unable to get any better speed to begin with unless he went with a capped LTE link.\nAnyway, this guy recently got a Mac, and is now beginning to enjoy the advantages. He just now discovered the App Store, and has been downloading some small apps. Apps that are say 3MB or so will download in 5-10 minutes for him, but as I said, he's pretty much fine with that.\nNow, however, he made the \"mistake\" of buying a game that weighed in at 3.8GB. He's now looking down the barrel of a 8-day solid download, during which (due to latencies and such) he won't really be able to do anything else with his connection.\nHe asked me if there was any way I could possibly download the app (on my nice 100Mbit connection!) and give it to him on a burned DVD or USB drive. Of course, Windows vets will be used to this method for dial-up dwellers - the traditional \"sneakernet\". I explained the issues with the App store being intimately connected to the Apple ID, and he said he'd be glad to share his Apple ID password with me and then just change it afterwards. \nI do have a spare Mac that could volunteer itself to be temporarily registered to his Apple ID to download the app. The only thing I am not sure of is if downloading the app on my machine, transferring the .app package to a flash drive and copying it to his machine will work. \nI would just try it but since we're dealing with \"live\" data here (i.e. his account) I don't want to do too many \"experiments\", and also I would like to be reasonably sure before I schedule another trip out there, only to find out it won't work.\nI do know Apple's crypto technologies are pretty deep and intense, and it's conceivable to me that each app download is somehow uniquely encrypted, to prevent obvious piracy. \nHas anyone else tried something like this, and if so, can it be done? \nThanks!\n\nA: I've tried it, and it works, provided that the app's makers don't put in their own special encryption system. There isn't even a limit of 5 computers per account on the Mac App Store (only iTunes and iOS), so you won't have to worry about that.\nEdit: There's another question like this here. The answerer agrees with me.\n", "Q: iOS S/MIME Signing Issues When I try to send an email using an installed S/MIME certificate on iOS, I get an alert that says: \n\nUnable to Sign: You can't send signed messages because a signing identity for the address could not be found. Go to the advanced settings for this account and choose a signing identity.\n\nI have a signing identity chosen in the S/MIME settings for the account, and I have tried exporting my private key from my Mac's keychain many different times. The certificate/key match the address I'm sending from. Am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Not all certificates are supported by iOS, it depends on the encryption method.\nI had issues with the free Comodo S/Mime certificates and switched to the free S/Mime certificates from Startssl.com, they work fine\n\nA: iOS Mail’s S/MIME functions seems to get confused by certificates with the same scope and certification authority being swapped out, as is the case with the free mail certificates, whose time limitations force a swap every year.\nIf you hit this issue after having swapped out your certificate, follow these steps to get to a clean state:\n\n\n*\n\n*make sure you have a .p12 file for your certificate at hand, or that you can re-download it from your certification authority;\n\n*delete all offending certificates (current or not) from Settings → General → Profiles;\n\n*reboot your device (hold the on/off button until the shutdown slider appears on screen, slide that, wait for the shutdown spinner to stop, restart device). This will flush Mail from memory and reset its caches, something that cannot be achieved by force quitting it, as parts of Mail run as a daemon;\n\n*import your certificate from step 1;\n\n*make sure the newly installed certificate is selected in Settings → Mail, Contacts, Calendar → [your account] → Account → Advanced → Sign.\n\n\nThe certificate should now be recognised correctly.\nRelated links\n\n\n*\n\n*Using S/MIME on iOS Devices – feinstruktur\n\n*Using S/MIME on iOS Devices – Mac OS X Hints\n\nA: I had the same issues but i fixed them with a different workaround. If you want to install your Private certificate. \nFirst install the Public certificate of the Issuing Certificate Authority then install your private Certificate as the second one.\nThis worked fine with my self issued Certificates :)\n\nA: I have a COMODO certificate and was able to get this to work. It is important to delete the previously existing certificates completely and re-start the iPhone / iPad. Then install the new certificate and check it is assigned in Mail settings.\n\nA: I had such problems too and lost hours on them.\nNow I can do it with iOS 13.3.1.\nI have installed successfully Actalis SMIME certificate following this steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*send the certificate unzipped and attached to email for which it should be used,\n\n*in iOS Mail receive the email and install the profile: tap the attachment, enter the code...\n\n*follow the instructions: go to settings, find your profile with the certificate pending below it, confirm it.\nNow you can receive encrypted mail but cannot sign or send encrypted mail.  Therefore, you must go to settings, accounts, IMAP, open the account, advanced and select the certificate you have just installed for signing and encrypting.\nIt should work without removing expired certificates.  If you remove expired certificates then you can't read emails that were encrypted for then, so be careful.\nThere is a warning \"certificate not signed\".  Eventually this does not appear to impede anything.  Maybe somebody will explain why, how, by whom the certificate should be signed.  I think that this used to be the cause of old problems that were solved around the beginning of year 2019.  This could be checked in iOS release notes.\n", "Q: SSD Partition Corrupted I recently installed a dual-drive setup where I have an SSD and an HDD. I had installed the OS and Apps on the SSD, and other stuff stayed on HDD. Recently my battery died, and I have been using the laptop on power (taken the battery off) because of which it would experience sudden shut down (due to frequent power failure in my area)\nYesterday when I started the Mac, it loaded up a grey boot screen with a loading bar. The loading bar took about 10-15 minutes to complete and then the Mac shut down again. I restarted and same thing happened. \nI then booted in Recovery Mode, and found out that the SSD Disk is showing up fine (Verified). However, the partition on it is greyed out and the Disk Utility can't seem to repair it.\nI want to know what I should do now (will most likely re-install OS X), and if the problem is with the SSD or is it just that something went corrupt (at the OS level) on the partition?\nOS X Mountain Lion, SSD: 128 GB Samsung Evo, MacBook Pro 13\" Early 2011 Model\nThanks!\n\nA: Sounds like a reinstall to me.\nEvery time you get a power-cut or you have to force-shut the power on the computer, you should run Repair Disk in the Disk Manager afterwards, because the HFS+ filesystem really is not very robust. Leave it for too long, with too many power cuts, and you could end up with an un-repairable partition.\nSo I sincerely hope that you had a backup, and it looks like you get to go through the OS X install procedure.\nOh - and go out and buy a replacement battery! It will be worth it in the long run, if only for providing enough power to allow you to shut down the machine properly in case of an extended power outage.\n\nA: Frequent power outs could lead to problems since your system does not have  batery to save the memory.\nRunning without battery will cut down the CPU speed to 1/2 of the normal.\nThe disk partition showing in gray, but the Disk Utility does not report an Error!\nCould be you are looking at one of the 2 hidden partitions? one is EFI the other one is the OS X recovery.\nReset your SMC and your EFI.\nIf that fails, run the fsck-fy to attempt to repair.\n", "Q: Lync and automatic reconnect I am using Microsoft Lync (14.0.8) with Mavericks (10.9.3) on a laptop.

Or simply no one has yet launched a similar project?\n\nA: You'd be surprised - Containers actually are supported - the OS X (and iOS) Sandbox has evolved to use them. They have been introduced in 10.7, and are now de facto standard in 10.10 and iOS 8. In the latter they are more strictly enforced (primarily due to reason of application security), to the point where an app can only see itself , and previous methods of enumerating processes or resources now return container-based results - similar to Linux ipc namespace - but more powerful.\n\nA: While it's using \"good old chroot(8)\", I started a project that tend to mimic docker's behavior on OS X and NetBSD. It's Free-as-in-speech and is available on GitHub. As the README says, this project is neither about security nor production, but will help testing full stacks natively on your workstation.\n\nA: I would imagine the answer to be that no one really wants it. It does seem to be doable. \nThese things are done mainly for one purpose, conserving performance for VPS vendors. And really no one wants a VPS instance to be OS X-based. \n\nA: A key element required for containerization is isolation of networking and other services, but not just isolation but also virtualization.  FreeBSD Jails, Linux \"containers\" (or more correctly \"namespaces\"), and Solaris/illumos zones all offer some degree of \"virtualization\" of these operating system system services.\nBy virtualization, this means that these servers are available (or potentially available) to things inside the \"container\", but in a way that protects the other things on the same host outside the container.  (For example, a container may have its own TCP/IP stack, with its own IP address, ARP cache, etc.)\nOS (operating system) virtualization is how we generally refer to this type of \"light-weight\" virtualization, where processes think they see a virtual kernel, but are all sharing the same real kernel under the hood; that kernel acts as a sort of hypervisor in ensuring that container/virtualization boundaries are not crossed.  (Put another way, the OS services are virtualized.)  Compare this to hardware virtualization, where what is virtualized is the hardware -- e.g. devices are emulated in software and presented to an operating system running in the container.  This is very powerful, but quite resource intensive -- each virtual machine must have its own copy of the operating system.\nRecent macOS has native hypervisor support via Hypervisor.framework which allows software like \"XHyve\" [A port of FreeBSD’s BHyve] (docker on macOS uses this), but lacks the necessary services under the hood to fully virtualize operating system services.\nIn truth, a lot of what is needed is probably already present, since the work to provide sandboxes means that there are already logical points where system calls are intercepted and handled differently for different applications.  However, that's far from the complete story -- implementing true separate network, IPC, and other namespaces is quite a lot of work.\nThe best reason for why Apple has not done this is likely the same reason that Apple has not released a platform suitable for running macOS in the data center for many years -- lack of market demand, or perceived lack of market demand by Apple leadership.  The desktop and mobile focus where they have focused their attention simply don't need virtual macOS instances that much.  (This is sad, because I would love to have virtual macOS support -- for example running macOS on VMs at Travis CI is really time consuming compared to Linux containers).\n\nA: docker (as I understand it ) is only \"virtualizing\" (layering) the file system and network (cpu / mem are only limited) so all of the same feature should be there but just not marketed the same way.\n", "Q: \"No definition found\" I recently restored my iPhone 5 from backup, and noticed that my dictionary always gives the message \"No definition found\" (although this could have started earlier and I just didn't notice until now).

I recently switched over to a dual hard-drive setup, and it worked perfectly. However, my brother is having issues. \nFirst off, here is the hard drive we are trying to put in.\nHe has an early 2011 15\" MacBook Pro. We read up online, and people said that the optical bay for his model only has SATA II, while the main bay has SATA III, which means he should put his HDD in the optical bay, and the SSD in the main bay. He wants to put the HDD in the optical drive area, and then transfer everything over to the new HDD, before putting the SSD into the main bay.\nThe issue is that when we put the HDD in the optical bay, the computer can basically not recognize or use it. If plug the HDD in via a usb cord, he can initialize it and erase it to Mac OSX Extended (Journaled) perfectly fine. It only takes a few seconds, and as far as I can tell, it works. However, when he actually puts the hard drive in the optical bay, it either doesn't show up in disk utility, or it shows up, but can't be accessed or changed.\nWe left it in, and it showed up after 30 minutes or so. When he tried to initialize it, however, the computer said it'd take 5 hours to do. The progress bar ended up getting half way done, and then stopping, so that didn't even work.\nWe thought that maybe it could be a firmware issue after searching on the internet some, but we looked and definitely have the newest firmware version (2.7, I believe). Also, I don't think that issue applies to us, since I think it's only relevant to getting the proper speeds out of a SSD.\nWe also tried just initializing it before putting it into the computer, but the computer doesn't seem to recognize it correctly. The name is changed from \"New HDD\" to \"disk1s1\", and we can't actually access it. That's when we tried initializing it again, just for the progress bar to get stuck.\nLooking online, this setup should work. Tons of people have done it, even using the hard drive we are using. We aren't even trying to put a SSD in yet, which is where most people have problems with the 2011 model. This is just a regular hard drive! I don't understand what could be wrong, and could use some help!\nIf there's anywhere else you think I should post this, just let me know!\nThank you!\n\nA: Firstly, it does not seem to really matter whether you use the Sata II or III port. For most usages you won't see the difference, cf this post for details: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/280002-32-sata-sata-practical-difference.\nGiven that the disk shows up fine via a USB interface it means that it's not at fault so it could actually be due to the connector in the optical bay which is a bit worn out or that the drive is not correctly plugged.\nTry putting the HD in the original HD bay and the SSD in the optical bay and see if the SSD has the same issue. If it has then the issue lies with the optical bay itself.\nYou could also put the optical disk back into the bay and see if it works normally or has issues as well.\nIf the issue seems to stem from the optical bay then you should bring the computer to a shop which can diagnose exactly what hardware issue is causing this.\n\nA: I believe the issue to be that the controller is still SATA III for the optical bay, yet the connector is a SATA II type, as is the cable.  So if you try and place a SATA III enabled drive in the optical bay, it will try and negotiate at SATA III speed (6G).  This creates an issue as the cable is not setup for this and the crosstalk, and very low SNR at that speed causes many errors.  I got my Seagate Momentus SSHD disk drive working somewhat in the optical bay by wrapping it and the short cable in tin foil, making it a good ground to the chassis, but it still had loads of errors on it.  I ended up putting a SATA II disk in which works.  My Macbook is a 2012 13in with an 2.9GHz i7 in it.  This shows both connectors as 7 series Intel Chipset, both of them are supported for 6G, yet the optical drive is negotiated as 3G (SATA II).  My Samsung SSD in the HDD bay, is negotiated as the full 6G.\nHave a check in system profiler to see what supported speeds and negotiated speeds you are seeing for your controllers.  There seems to be a lot of conflicting information about what model supports what, but it makes sense that the controllers are the same type on the main board for the particular chipset being used.  The connectors are different though.\nI was hoping there would be a hard disk that you can force SATA II on, or some way of enforcing the controller to only ever negotiate up to 3G, but thus far haven't had any luck :-(\nHope that helps demystify the core issue at stake here somewhat.\n", "Q: Can I tell itunes to download a specific podcast on Saturdays only? So there is this one podcast I like but I only want to get the episodes published on Saturdays. Is it possible? They publish a podcast everyday but I am only interested in the ones that are on Saturdays. \n\nA: You can use the following AppleScript:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set aList to every track of playlist \"Podcasts\" whose album is \"podcast_name\"\n    repeat with aTrack in aList\n        set aDate to release date of aTrack\n        set aWeekday to weekday of aDate as string\n        if aWeekday is equal to \"Saturday\" then\n            updatePodcast aTrack\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nI would save this AppleScript as application and execute it whenever you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the application \"AppleScript Editor\" in the Utility folder.\n\n*Paste the code above.\n\n*Set \"podcast_name\" to the name of the podcast\nyou want to update.\n\n*Save the Apple Script as application.\n\n\nTo schedule this AppleScript, you can get hints at the tutorial I found.\n", "Q: Suddenly lost all contacts and calendar entries My iPhone just lost all of my contacts and calendar entries, except for 5 contacts that I haven't used in years and actually deleted a few months ago.  It also lost my saved player info for at least one game (Infinity Blade II).\nI didn't change anything or do anything to my phone; it just suddenly doesn't have any of this information.  I still have all my apps, most of which seem to be fine, and I still have my recent calls information, but there are no names associated with the numbers.\nWhat could have caused this and how can I get everything back?\nEDIT: I tried restarting my phone. That didn't seem to help. But, here it is, 15 minutes later, and almost everything is back. I'm still missing a couple of contacts and my game profile.\nEDIT 2: What I would still like to figure out is what happened. The answers are all focused on backup & restore options. None of them addresses what might have gone wrong or how I can prevent this from happening again in the future, which is the real point of this question.\n\nA: Recommend you do this\niOS: Back up and restore your iOS device with iCloud or iTunes\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1766\nHere is also very nice step by step.\n\nA: i just backed up manually and everything came back..\n", "Q: Song cannot be played on this iPhone I have recently added a number of songs to my iTunes playlist (all mp3s). When syncing them over to my iPhone I get an error saying that 'X track cannot be played on this iPhone'.\nWhat could be the reason for this? The file isn't from the iTunes store so I don't think DRM on the track.\nWhat could be the issue?\n\nA: I had this issue this morning. I had to force quit iTunes, unplug my iPhone, reboot it, then reconnect it and sync the playlists that wouldn't sync earlier. It seemed to work, as I now have those playlists. I think iTunes experienced a technical issue somehow with its encoding process.\n\nA: One way to confirm whether the files are really just MP3 files is to open them in QuickTime and then open the Inspector (hold ⌘ and tap I or choose from Show Inspector from Window menu). The Inspector will tell you the file type (if it recognises it).\nIf these are MP3 files it should say something that starts with \"MPEG Layer 3\" for the format. If it doesn't then either it isn't an MP3 file, or it is but one that is corrupted in some way.\nAssuming these are simple MP3 files, having looked at other reports of people getting the same error message, have you tried removing the files from your iPhone and syncing them back over again. It seems people can get this error if the files are corrupted while syncing.\n\nA: I was having the same error message. The problem was that my files were moved. facepalm I deleted them from the library and re-added them from the new address. Worked. Cheers.\n\nA: iTunes might be refusing to sync the tracks because they use an encoding format that it knows isn't supported on iOS devices. As an example, the iPhone 5s technical specification on Apple's website lists the supported bitrates for constant rate MP3s as \"8 to 320 Kbps\". If the bitrate for the files is outwith those limits that might be the cause of the failure to sync the files.\nYou could try using the \"Create AAC Version\" option on the right-click context menu in iTunes to create a copy in AAC format of one of the affected tracks, then attempt to sync the AAC copy, to see whether it is the format of the file that it is objecting to.\nYou can also confirm the bitrate of the files by right-clicking on them and choosing Get Info.\n\nA: I'm syncing an old 2005 ipod to a newer MacBook Pro using El Capitan 10.11.4. I got this very same message. Solution was to simply quit and restart iTunes. Sync worked the second time around. Try this before creating lower bit-rate versions of all your songs!\n\nA: If you're trying to get a song from your PC to your Phone, make sure you send the file (the song) to your desktop before syncing.\n\nA: I had the same problem, however the problem occurred because i had moved the music to a different location (Documents to Music) within the computer, \nI solved this simply by moving it back to where iTunes last saw it when i put it into iTunes and the problem seemed to be fixed. \n\nA: The Following steps worked ​to fix the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take a backup of the file.\n\n*Delete the song from iTunes library.\n\n*Sync your iPhone/iPad\n\n*Replace the file at the original location\n\n*Add the file back to iTunes and sync your device.\n​​​​ \n\nA: Right click the song and click \"make MP3 version\".\n", "Q: Airplay mirroring with extended desktop: how to choose which apps end up on Apple TV? I use my Macbook hooked up to a TV via HDMI for most of my work, and want to use Airplay mirroring from my Mac to extend my desktop and play online videos full screen on my Apple TV while also being able to do work on my computer that won't end up on the screen. It seems to me that using airplay mirroring with the \"desktop extension\" option is the best way to do this. However, whenever I turn it on, all of my apps end up on the TV screen and my desktop ends up completely blank. Is there a way to choose which desktop is the one that goes on to the TV?\n\nA: When you switch from Mirroring to Extended Desktop\n\nTo move open windows, or Applications, to the Apple TV display simply\n  click and drag the window by the Title Bar to the left hand side of\n  your display (keep dragging over the screen edge). As you do this the window will appear in a transparent\n  view on the Apple TV display.

A power source that does not meet those specification results in a slow charge. However, what happens when the specifications (volt/amps) increased & decrease (fluctuate)? Will the power fluctuations cause damage to the battery? Assuming there is a voltage regulator to keep it from going too high, will this still cause damage?\n\nA: Connecting directly the solar panel to your iPhone will have negative influence on your battery. \nSolar system that are design to charge the phone/GPS/what so ever, use a second battery as buffer. Do you use a system that has not one. \n\nA: I was recently told by my landlords electrician that the voltage in my flat fluctuates quite badly, and that it can contribute to some devices having shorter lifespans. \nBut where I notice it most is in charging my phone, on a full charge at home my phone will last around 10 hours with a couple of hours of screen on time. \nWhen I charge the same phone at my parents house, with similar power usage, wi-fi turned on, same apps syncing ect. It will last nearly 24 hours with 5-6 hours of screen on time. \nThis is all using the same charging brick and lead. The only solution the electrician told me about, was some sort of regulator that could be fitted to normalize the voltages. He said that it would cost a couple of hundred £'s :(\n", "Q: How can I protect Single User Mode to require a password? I once read that you can modify a file on the computer to make Single User Mode behave differently, called \"boot.rc\" or something similar. Is it possible to modify the behavior of SUM? Since physical access would compromise all security (except FileVault) is it possible to prevent SUM from running bash and immediately boot into the GUI (or at least into something which requests a password) so potential hackers would have no way to gain root access without a password?\n\nA: You can add a firmware password, which will need to be entered before the Mac can be booted into Single User Mode (or from external media). Boot with ⌘R to enter Recovery, then select Firmware Password Utility from the Utilities menu to set it up.\n\nA: Another option is to enable FileVault 2. It makes entering single user mode require the login password of an account that is allowed to unlock the disk.\n\nA: You can set a firmware password, which will prevent booting to single user, verbose, boot selector, target firewire/thunderbolt, etc. Here's how:\nhttp://osxdaily.com/2014/01/06/set-firmware-password-mac/\n", "Q: Automate mobile terminal? I have a jailbroken iPhone.\nI use it to reboot my router when my wifi is going slow or messing up.\nBut I'm lazy and I was looking for a way to automate the process.\nI use shortcuts that mobile terminal lets you create so you can just tap the command instead of having to type it.\nBut is there a way I can create a script or run everything with a single command to do this for me?\nCommands are as follows:\nsu\n\n(su password)\n\nssh 192.168.1.1\n\n(router password)\n\nreboot\n\nCan I jam all of that into one single process?\n\nA: The script you want would be the following:\n#!/bin/bash\nsu\nssh 192.168.1.1 <<-EOF\n    reboot\n    exit\nEOF\n\nIf you can ssh into your iPhone from a computer, do so. Once you're logged in, create a new text file using nano ~/script (install nano from cydia if it isn't already) and paste the above script. Then hit ^X (control-X) and Y to save the script. The script is in your home directory (~) for quick access. Now, set the proper permissions to be able to execute the script: \nchmod 755 script\n\nNow you can open MobileTerminal on the iPhone and type ./script, which will execute it.\nIf you have to do it locally, the easiest way is probably using iFile: open it and change to the home folder using the button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap on \"edit\" (top right) and \"+\" (bottom left). \n\n*Enter a name and change the type to \"Regular File\", then tap \"Create\". \n\n*Tap on the file and select \"Text Viewer\" in the list. \n\n*Tap on \"Edit\" and copy the above script\n\n*Tap \"Save\" and \"Done\" and go to MobileTerminal to execute it (no need to set permissions, iFile did it)\n\n\nFinal note: you might want to set up automatic login using keys: http://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/\nThat way, you only have to launch the script, no password-typing required.\n", "Q: How to delete all my progress in Fruit Ninja?

Then use the TransMac application under Windows and burn DMG on your USB stick. You will be able to boot from this USB stick into Recovery Mode and from there you can run Terminal to copy\\move files or do whatever you need.\nApple should distribute some bootable ISO or DMG image which can be downloaded from their website and burned on disk or USB and used to recover Mac offline. \n\nA: Can you start up in Internet recovery mode by holding option-command-R on startup? If you can, try to reinstall OS X over the existing installation. Internet recovery mode is supported by all Macs that came with 10.7 or later and by some older Macs after a firmware update. It is different from the normal recovery mode and does not require a recovery partition.\nIf others got here searching for how to copy files to an external drive and you are able to start up in recovery mode or Internet recovery mode, you can create a disk image from Disk Utility. Hold command-R on startup, open Disk Utility, select either the OS X volume or the drive of the OS X volume, press the New Image button on the toolbar, and save the image on an external drive. Or if you can start up in single user mode, you can mount an external drive in single user mode by running\nmount -uw /\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.notifyd.plist\nlaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.kextd.plist\nmkdir /tmp/a\nmount_hfs /dev/disk1s2 /tmp/a\n\nwhere /dev/disk1s2 is a disk identifer shown by diskutil list.\n", "Q: How to repair Mac partitions without Internet Recovery and Rescue USB? Resizing the C:\\ drive under Windows(bootcamp) corrupted mac partitions. Neither Mac OS X nor Windows are able to boot.

I heard TestDisk could fix that, but how do I run it?\n\nA: There is not much you can do with a stock Mac to fix the hard drive.\nYou could plug the hard drive in another Mac (as a secondary drive, not a boot one) and see what Disk Utility tells you (press command-space then type Disk Utility to launch it) about it but it's not guaranteed to help you much. I am not even sure it can correctly repair a boot hard drive.\nYour best bet is using a disk repair program such as DiskWarrior (http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/).\nIt costs a bit but has a very good reputation and saved many damaged hard drives. Cf http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/ode_to_diskwarrior_superduper_dropbox for a great example of it saving important data.\n\nA: Windows had changed the HD partition map from GUID Partition Table(GPD) to MBR. And made HD a \"dynamic disk\". This is why Mac Os wasn't able to boot. \nSo, I've tried 1001 ways to recover. Nothing worked. Interned Recovery gives -2002F error. Macbook pro 2012 can't boot from bootable DVD to use DiskWarrior, Drive Genius or similar. It can't boot from OS X Lion install DVD. I could boot Windows recovery console and tried TestDisk which failed to write something to HFS+. Also tried some Windows third party applications which also failed. \nI asked a friend with latest Mavericks(which I had too) to make a Recovery USB using OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0 and make a DMG file from it using Disk Utility and send me over internet. Then I used the TransMac application under Windows and burned DMG on my USB stick. I was able to boot from this USB stick into Recovery Mode and from there I can reinstall Mac Os X Mavericks. Somehow it sees my Ethernet cable and doesn't give error.\nNote: that Disk Utility wasn't able to recover partitions. I tried to run DiskWarrior from terminal but it gave me an error. TestDisk didn't run too. I could recover or backup my files using Paragon Rescue Kit for Mac Bootable CD, but there was no need since it's my new macbook and I didn't have much files there. I made a clean installation on a USB stick and run DiskWarrior and Drive Genius, none of them could fix partitions. So I gave up and reformatted HD. \nThat's probably not the answer on how to fix partitions, but that's how I solved this. If somebody finds a way to fix partitions please post as an answer. \n\nA: The new version of DiskWarrior (version 5, around 120$) can fix partition table damage and may possibly be able to fix this.\n", "Q: Backup for downgrade from Mavericks to Snow Leopard on smaller Hard Drive? This Problem might be very specific.\nAfter having been very happy with Snow Leopard for quite a while I am now seriously considering upgrading to Mavericks with my 2010 iMac.\nI would however like to save a copy of the old system to be able to downgrade and get back to it without having trouble and without losing any data.\nMy system hard drive is 1 TB (460 GB used) and I have a Time Machine backup on an external hard drive. Of course I don't want to touch this backup device.\nI have another 200 GB hard drive and I was thinking about creating a bootable clone of my system on this device that I could use to get back to Snow Leopard.\nOf course 200 GB isn't enough space for a complete clone copy. But since I have the Time Machine backup I wouldn't necessarily need to backup my user data, and then I have only like 150 GB to backup. So in principle my system without the user data should fit on the smaller device.\nIs there any (not too complicated) way to do such a backup? Can Carbon Copy Cloner do that?\n\nA: It can be done but involves a lot of juggling.\nYour best option would be to shrink your existing partition, create a new partition then install Mavericks into the new partition.\nYou need to boot into recovery mode (or from the Snow Leopard CD) to shrink the partition (using Disk Utility) as you cannot resize the active partition. You can copy existing data from the original partition during installation.\n\nA: Carbon copy cloner allows you to select the files and programs you want to include in the clone, so it should work.   I use it for routine backup of my Snow Leopard system HD.  I do test the clone most times and it works fine.\nI also have a CC clone of Tiger, my original OS, saved after upgrading to Snow Leopard via clean install not too long ago.  This allowed me to upgrade FCE 3.5 to FCE 4.0  and edit my old tape HD and new ACVHD clips on the same system.  A long strange trip but worth it.\nHaven't tried booting from the Tiger clone (no reason to) but I think it would work too...\n", "Q: How to disable smart quotes [OS X 10.9.3 (Mavericks)] I've disabled smart quotes in the keyboard settings, but whenever I type ' or \" in Messages (old name: iChat), they get converted to ‘ and “. How do I disable this default conversion?\n\nA: In addition to System Preferences, this feature can be turned on and off in each app via Edit > Substitutions.  Make sure you check that setting as well.\n\nA: You will find this option in the Keyboard Preferences pane:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Click on the Keyboard icon.\n\n*Select the Text tab.\n\n*Uncheck the Use smart quotes and dashes checkbox.\n\n\nNote that this is almost a homework question. This is a keyboard/text related setting so it's fairly logical to find it under the Keyboard Preferences.\n\nA: In El Capitan (i.e. 10.11.1), I solved it by changing the Smart Quote settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Keyboard in System Preferences\n\n*Go to Text tab\n\n*Change values for \"for Double Quotes\" and \"for Single Quotes\" from drop-down selection to use the simple quotes \"\" rather than ““\n\n\nThat's it.

And how do I remove/delete/uninstall it?\n(Also I don't understanding why am I'm seeing notifications from it while it's in the \"Not In Notification Center\" list.)\n\n\nA: It got in there through a popup like the following:\n\nYou can remove it from the list by going into Safari, opening its Preferences, and managing through the Notifications tab.\nIt seems that, at least on Mavericks, if you have the Notification Style set to Banner or Alert then it will force the notification into Notification Center.\n", "Q: How can I mirror one Mac's screen to another? Here's the situation: I have a MacBook Air that I'd like to mirror the display (and audio) of to a Mac Mini, via WiFi.\nIt is completely possible to mirror the MacBook Air to an Apple TV (using \"AirPlay Mirroring\"), but I'd like to know if it's possible to do the same thing between two Macs, even if it means using third-party software.\nMore detail: the Mac Mini is connected to a screen only, there's no mouse & keyboard attached, so a solution that involves manually starting some software on it (e.g. Remote Desktop) is no good; I'd like something that just sits quietly and takes over the screen when it receives something from the MacBook.\n\nA: Use Airdisplay by Avatron this way you can use your 2nd's Mac Screen just as a normal 2nd Screen attached to you first Mac.\nThen you just need to set the mirrored option in System Preferences.\nAnd as a Plus there is also an App for iPad so if you like to take your screen with you just do the same thing with you iPad.\nAn other solution is to use VNC which is built in on OS X and free (read more about it on http://www.davidtheexpert.com/post.php?id=5) You just need to enable the VNC Server (you do this in the System Preferences under -> Network screen shot follows when im @home on my mac) on the one Mac you like to mirror and on the other start the VNC Client (called ScreenSharing) and connect to your other Mac.\n\nA: You can install the program \"AirServer\" on the Mac Mini to be able to AirPlay the display directly to it: \nhttp://www.airserver.com/Download\n\n\nA: I believe this is a cleaner solution for someone who's needing to use a recent iMac as an external monitor for a recent Macbook. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204592\n", "Q: Mac freezes when I try to open a particular Folder I am using Mac Book Pro with Mavericks. For last couple of weeks, I have been noticing that my whole machine going in to Freeze, when I try to open a particular folder. \nEvery time when I \"force quit\" (option+command+esc), I find the \"Folder option\" in a \"Non response\" mode. \nUntil I \"Relaunch\" the finder, It's not going back to normal. \nWhat should I do? Is it happening for any virus or something? \nPlease share with me, if you have any idea.\nThanks in Advance.\n\nA: It seems likely that the problem stems from corrupted data on your hard drive.\nThe Finder asks the FileSystem to give it information about the content of the folder and either the Finder fails to properly handle the error returned by the FileSystem or the FileSystem keeps trying endlessly to access the faulty data without properly returning.\nIn order to make sure it's not simply a Finder bug, check whether you can access the folder fine from a Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Finder window and go to the parent of the problem folder.\n\n*Select the parent folder and command-click on it to reveal the contextual menu.\n\n*Select Get Info.\n\n*Look for the Where: field, it shows the actual path of the parent folder.\n\n*That will be something like /Users/your-user-name/Path/To/Parent\n\n*Select the path and copy it.\n\n*Open a Terminal window (press command-space and type terminal).\n\n*type cd (ending space) then paste the copied path. This should look like:\n\n*\n\n*cd /Users/your-user-name/Path/To/Parent/problem-folder\n\n*If any folder in the path contains spaces, enclose the whole path with double quotes. I.e.: cd \"/Users/your-user-name/Pa th/T o/Parent\"\n\n\n*type ls -lR \"problem-folder\" replacing the last parameter with the name of the problem folder.\n\n\nNormally this should list the content of the problem folder as well as that of all its subfolders (this should print a lot of text if the folder hierarchy is deep).\nSince this completely bypasses the Finder, if this works it means that the bug lies with how the Finder deals with the folder data (for whichever reason). However if the Terminal freezes when running this command, this would really point toward a hard drive issue.\nIn the latter case I would recommend that you first run Apple's DiskUtility application and attempt to verify the disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch DiskUtility (press command-space and type Disk Utility).\n\n*On the left pane, select the hard drive your folder resides on.\n\n*On the right pane, click the Verify Disk button.\n\n\nThis should take a bit of time and will print a list of possible errors. If there are any issues and/or if the log indicates that you should run a repair on the disk then you should press the Repair button.\nIn any case it should not hurt if you choose to repair the disk even if no errors are displayed.\nIf a repair fixes the issue, then this likely indicates that the error was not due to a faulty hard drive but to invalid FileSystem data and you should be good to go again.\nHowever, if the problem persists your hard drive could be the cause of the FileSystem corruption.\nIn this case I highly recommend to buy a more powerful disk diagnostic and repair program such as DiskWarrior (you will find it at http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/), it is one of the most reputed disk repair program on the Mac.\nUpdate:\nIf ls -lR works correctly, this points to a Finder issue.\nIt could be a buggy QuickLook plugin which is triggered when opening the folder and which has trouble opening some of your files. This does not mean that these files are corrupt.\nUsing the terminal, use the mv command to move files to another folder to see if this fixes the issue. For example you could do:\n\n\n*\n\n*mv problem-folder/a* fixa\n\n*mv problem-folder/b* fixb\n\n*etc.\n\n\nThen try opening each of the fix folders to see which ones freeze or not.\nThis way you would be able to identify precisely which file(s) causes the issue if it's caused by a file.\nIf you have installed Quicklook plugins you might want to try to disable them temporarily to see if that fixes the issue.\n", "Q: Does AppleCare care if I've modded my machine? I have a 15\" MacBook Pro whose SuperDrive I have removed and added a ssd. It's been running well like this everyday for 30 months. \nI was using it the other day, and the video started to freak out with a bunch of lines on the screen printer the computer crashed and now it won't boot. When I turn it on I got a bunch of video artifacts and then the machine stops. \nSeems like a pretty cut and dry hardware failure to me. I'd like to take it in to Apple to have them replace the logic board, but I'm worried that they'll balk when they see the modifications I've made.\nDo you think that it'll be an issue with them, or are they likely to recognize the problem as being unrelated to the changes I've made?\n\nA: Generally all changes you made yourself are not liked at Apple. They cancel your guarantee. But I don't think I will be an issue other than that. They will probably just replace it. I wouldn't tell them though, that you made these changes, because depending on how nice the person you get to repair your MacBook is, he'll maybe just ignore that you modified it, and maybe you have to pay less.\n\nA: It is Apple's discretion if the modification is the cause of the problem, in which case…\n\nThe Plan does not apply to: […]\n(ii) Damage caused by\n(a) a product that is not the Covered Equipment,\n\nFurthermore, Apple doesn't cover modified equipment anyway…\n\n(iii) Covered Equipment with a serial number that has been altered, defaced or removed, or has been modified to alter its functionality or capability without the written permission of the manufacturer;\n\nSource: https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/applecare/appgeos.html\n", "Q: Prevent installation of malware, spyware... Admin password requirement I am new in Mac world. I am the only user of my Mac with OS X 10.9.3 but sometimes other people use my computer. \nMy purpose is to prevent installation of malware, spyware and surveillance software.\nIs OS X secure about this, if not, how can I make it secure? \nCan I let my Mac ask administrator password whenever a user including admin and Guest accounts install applications?\n\nA: If other people use only the guest account, then they have no privileges to install anything.\nI have added another account (beside the admin and guest account) which I use for daily work. The reason: sometimes someone ask me if he can use my computer for a short moment, and this way I do not have to switch to the guest account.\nAnd because this third account has no admin privileges, it is more secure than using an admin account for daily work.\n\nA: To expand on @Martin's suggestion of using a non-admin account for day-to-day operations: you can convert your existing account to a non-admin, and save the trouble of switching to a new account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new administrator account (in System Preferences -> Users & Groups)\n\n*Log out of your regular account, then log in as the new admin\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Users & Groups, and remove the admin rights for your regular account\n\n*Restart the computer, then log in with your regular (no longer admin) account\n\n\nNote that even though you aren't logged in as an admin, you can still perform administrative tasks; you'll just have to provide the admin account's name & password each time (e.g. by clicking the padlock icon in System Preferences).\nYou can tighten things a little more by putting some additional restrictions on software installation by tightening the Gatekeeper policy. Open System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General tab, click the padlock and authenticate as the admin, then change the \"Allow apps downloaded from:\" policy to \"Mac App Store\". Note that you will still be able to install other apps, but it'll require a special override (see \"How to open an app from a unidentified developer and exempt it from Gatekeeper\" in Apple's support article on Gatekeeper) -- which will require the admin name & password.\nIf you want to be really restrictive, you can even limit installations from the Mac App Store by enabling parental controls on your account (you'll have to actually log into the admin to do this), and setting limits on what apps can be purchased, installed, and run. But I'd consider this overkill, since everything in the App Store has been vetted by Apple; it's not an absolute guarantee it's not malicious, but I'd consider it pretty safe.\n", "Q: How to uninstall wget I recently installed wget on my Mac using the instructions listed here: http://osxdaily.com/2012/05/22/install-wget-mac-os-x/\nand lorcan's instructions here: How do I get \"wget\" for Snow Leopard?\nHowever, I realized that I installed an outdated version of wget.\nIs there an easy way to uninstall wget from my system?\n\nA: It depends on how you installed wget in the first place.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you installed directly from source, run sudo rm /usr/local/bin/wget\n\n*If you installed via Homebrew, run brew uninstall wget (or just use brew upgrade wget to install the most recent version)\n\n", "Q: Rotation lock on a iPhone 5 How can I find the rotation lock switch on a iPhone 5?

I have two of them, and several iOS devices, and this issue exists for all combinations.\nThe issue: I'll be streaming something in Safari, YouTube App, etc. and AirPlay it to my TV. It works fine for awhile, but then all of a sudden, the video will stop playing. On my iOS device, I get a message that says the connection has been dropped (or something along those lines).\nLike I said, I have this issue on both Apple TVs. One is hardwired to the router, and one is operating via WiFi. At this point, I have to believe that it's something happening on my network causing packet loss.\nMy main question is how to troubleshoot this issue. Anyone have any idea where I can get some sort of log from the Apple TV, or perhaps the iOS device? I could go through my router settings and just guess at stuff (which I already did) to try to improve network quality, but I really need to be able to narrow down what the issue is.\nAny insight on how to troubleshoot this issue would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: There are multiple tools available on your Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*open Console and look around the time stamp of the event (lost connection) to see what is it reporting.\n\n*Use Ping to test the connection speed and stability\nApple TV: Go to the Settings menu on Apple TV, select General > Network -note the IP address (you will need it later).\n\n\n*\n\n*Start Network Utility \n\n\nPing your Apple TV IP, you might want to run a continuous ping to see if it changes significantly over time.\n\nRead more \"how to\" here:\nTesting TCP port connectivity between computers and devices\n\nA: One of the issues I had with AirPlay was very similar to yours, and it was solved by changing my wifi router.  \nBuscar's suggestions are great - try them and see if they give you any useful diagnostics.  (please post a comment to tell us what you found.) I've personally found that tweaks to the router settings rarely yielded more than a bit more time before the same failure would occur again (including trying to locate interference-free channels etc.).\nA way to test this in hardware may be borrowing a higher-quality router from someone for a few hours to see if that helps.  In my case, after weeks of software/router tweaking, changing from a cheap Belkin router to a Netgear wnr2000v (a friend's) caused all the problems to vanish - none of my devices lose connection anymore.  \nYou did mention that one of your Apple TV's is cabled to the router.  However, I imagine you're still streaming from a computer over Wifi.  In either case, it's also possible that the router doesn't handle long streams of data even over the cable...\n\nA: I had the same issue with an Apple TV 3. The signal would drop intermittently (every couple of minutes).\nI read various forums ad nauseam and tweaked my router (the settings were fine, and it is located 5 feet from the Apple TV). I ended up unplugging the Apple TV 3 from the Monster Power strip and plugging it into a completely separate outlet.\nVoila! It appears that there was interference between the power strip and the Apple TV 3.\nLuckily, it's an easy thing to check.\n\nA: In my case after running a ping test for a minute, I observed variable lags and fluctuations among ping times. Results were in 30-600 ms range. After reading Zach's response I moved apple tv and the wifi router to the same power strip and isolated power supply from my computer .. Voila! :) Ping times are now in a stable 3-8 ms range and streaming is smooth. In my general opinion, Streaming Issues are mostly rooted from power line electrical noise issues.\n\nA: It was driving me mental when songs would drop out when i change tracks on airplay through Apple TV 3 - but no problems at all with any of my other wifi speakers. \nThis sorted it for me... on your apple TV, Go to Settings > Airplay and turn off 'Play from itunes in the cloud'. Solved it for me instantly seems 'the cloud' struggles with my music. like my missus. Why this is even an option is beyond me.\n", "Q: Can't install zeroMQ on Mavericks I am starting with zeroMQ but could get it to work.

After having my iPhone disconnected for some time, will all the text messages people have sent me, arrive to the phone once I reconnect it?\n\nA: Usually SMS messages have a 'lifetime' of around 9 days - this is set by the carrier.\niMessages should be delivered the next time you connect your iPhone to a network.\n", "Q: Time Machine not detecting changes in certain folders I recently noticed that TM does not update its backup from certain folders any more.\nI have a deep sub folder inside ~/Documents, and when I create new folders or files in it, they do not appear in the TM backup. The backup contains, however, lots of files created until Oct 2, 2013. Which means that TM used to backup the contents of this folder.\nNow, before you suggest that I have probably disabled backup for this folder - nope:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I check with tmutil isexcluded for paths of files that didn't get backed up, it says [Included].\n\n*When I then added another disk as a second backup destination, that backup does contain the missing files. This proves that the source is accessible and can be backed up. So, any suggestions that the path may contain invalid chars or is too long doesn't apply, either.\n\n\nSomehow the existing backup got stuck, preventing it from updating these particular folder contents.\n\n\n*\n\n*The system log does not show any messages related to this.\n\n*A disk verification with Disk Utility does not show errors, either.\nI could just erase the entire backup and start over, but I would rather not lose my previous versions.\nAny ideas how to possibly \"reset\" or fix the backup so that it backs up the missing files again? I suspect that there's some kind of database that TM maintains to be able to quickly browse its backup folders, and maybe that's corrupt somehow, but I cannot find one.\nHere's another idea: If the source disk was modified without OS X watching over it (thru fsevents), e.g. by booting from another system, the TM detects this and starts a complete comparison again, right? I wonder if I can trigger that, and that this will fix the issue.\nIn the past I've seen knowledgeable people indicate that TM backups can get broken once the backiup gets full and needs deletion of old versions (this is the case here), but no one was able to explain what exactly goes wrong and whether this can be fixed. If you know more details, please comment. I just might write a tool for that in the end :)\n(I am an advanced Mac user and programmer; I am using 10.9.3)\n\nA: What actually helped was to identify the folder inside which no file changes were detected, and then rename that folder and force a backup. Then all new content inside it got added to the old backup. After that, I renamed the folder back to its original name, added another file inside and did another backup - again, the new file got backed up.\nSo, somehow, that folder got stuck, and by renaming it, I could reset the backup for it.\nStill, I will keep an eye out for other folders that may not get backed up, using the tmutil compare command regularly.\nYou just can't trust Time Machine.\nThat's why I also use CrashPlan as a secondary, and offline, backup.\n\nA: Try this (You shouldn't lose any old backups):\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Time Machine in System Preferences (make sure it is not backing up, if it is, let it finish).\n\n*Disconnect the hard drive\n\n*Delete this file: sudo rm -rf /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist (you will need your root password, usually the same as your login password if you are admin).\n\n*Shut down your Mac and reset the PRAM. (Shut down mac, press the power button, hold down command(⌘) + option + p + r BEFORE the gray screen appears. Keep holding until you hear the startup chime for the second time. Computer will then boot)\n\n*Reconnect the hard drive\n\n*Re-enable Time Machine in System Preferences\n\n\nA: Remove the /.fseventsd folder on your drive, TM is using the information from the fseventsd daemon and this way you force TM to do a deep traversal of the drive.  \nKill the fseventsd daemon (the daemon starts automatically) after you removed the /.fseventsd folder, the fseventsd daemon creates a new /.fseventsd folder. With deep traversal it takes a while for TM to prepare the new backup but afterwards it should backup all files which are not already in the backup.\n\nA: this might help. not sure. I moved away from Time Machine a while back due to issues like this.\nHow to force a Time Machine deep traversal?\nsb\n", "Q: I don't have access to the Apple ID acct on my iPad and the login icons keep poppin up. What can I do I can't access the Apple ID acct on my device. The device was given to me and she never told me the password and I can't ask her. What can I do?\n\nA: Whatever you do, do NOT do a factory reset, because if the device ever needs activating it will require the password. This is to deter thievery.\nYou need to turn off the iCloud integration, and switch all the IDs to be yours. I believe that to do this you will need the password for the current ID, so you really should go to your friend and get her to type the password in for you.\nAgain - this is to stop people from stealing iPads/iPhones, as they are effectively unusable without the password.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 reset is taking a very long time I'm passing my IPhone 4 on to my mother, and I wanted to reset it. So I went into settings -> general -> reset, and I picked the option to reset all settings and remove all the data. Now I'm seeing a screen with a spinner on it. How long can I expect this to take? At what point should I reboot the phone and try again?\nI'm still running IOS 5.something on it, because I had jailbroken it, but according to most sites I'm reading, the jailbreak shouldn't affect the reset.\n\nA: Doing Reset All Settings on a jailbreak is fine and should be done within a few minutes.\nHowever, doing Erase All Content and Settings on a jailbroken device will never complete and will break everything, usually resulting in a boot loop. There is no 'fix' for running the latter on a jailbroken device and the device will need to be restored in iTunes.\nConnect your device to iTunes, then enter DFU (hold power and home until the screen turns off and back on with the Apple logo, then let go of power but keep holding home). Once the device appears in iTunes, restore it.\n", "Q: No more multi-language detection autocorrect in mac os x 10.7.5? I've updated to Mac OS X 10.7.5 and now the autocorrect no longer works as beautifully as it used to. Prior to update, whether I was in mail, safari, wherever, it detected the language & suggested the appropriate correction…now it is only detecting one language (the first on my list in settings) and doesn't detect when I'm using the second language on my list in system preferences.\nCan I revert back to the previous software versions b/c this is really frustrating?!?!\n…or does anyone know how to fix this??\n\nA: You should find the setting in your System Preferences.\nSelect Automatic by language or your choice.\n\n\nA: In System Prefs/Language & Text/Text/Spelling, go to the Setup item on the list and make sure that only the languages you are interested in have their boxes checked.  You need to also check that Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar is also set correctly in the app you are using.\nThat is the best you can do.  I've rarely heard of anyone who thought Apple's multilingual spellcheck was very satisfactory.  But it should detect both languages, unless one of them is a 3rd party add-on dictionary, in which case there is no guarantee.\nIf by chance you are talking about the Pages app or Word, let us know, because the above is not relevant for that.\n", "Q: How to remap 'Shift & Up/Down arrow keys' to type actual up & down arrows?

But, I want to install Xcode 6 and more specifically Swift. How do I do that?\n\nA: Xcode 6 currently requires an active iOS or Mac Developer Program membership, available from developer.apple.com/programs, as Xcode 6 and Swift is not publicly available yet.  Once Xcode 6 is out of beta / prerelease anyone should be able to download it from the MAS, but that is speculation based on past experience and not something Apple has announced. \n", "Q: how to access Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) via VNC-over-SSH? I've done a bit of research and it seems ARD is somewhat based on VNC technology. It even has the option to allow access via VNC viewers using a password.\nI want to enable this option so I can interact with my mac pro when needed. But I'm wary of the security.\nI've use VNC-over-SSH in the past but with other OSes like FreeBSD and Linux. I'm wondering if something like this is feasible on OSX using built-in features.\nI've searched the net but didn't find what I'm looking for.\nThanks a lot :)\n\nA: So you can.  If you open System Preferences > Sharing, and check both remote management (to start the vnc server) and remote login (to start the ssh server); you should be able to login remotely using vnc over ssh.\nNote: You must have all needed ports forwarded correctly, and an android client capable of connecting over ssh.\n", "Q: How to sync mouse pointer correctly in screen sharing when connecting to a Windows VM? I am using the screen sharing application on a MacBook Air running OS X 10.9.3 to connect to a Windows 7 virtual machine on a different computer.\nAlthough the keyboard and mouse work in general (input is received by the VM), the mouse pointer is not synced correctly. I see two mouse pointers: the Windows one and the one from my Mac. However, the Windows mouse pointer is always off by quite a bit. It seems to have a higher acceleration. If I quickly move my mouse, the Windows mouse pointers moves more than my Mac's.\nI cannot find any information on the Web about this problem. Is this a known issue? Should it work with Windows systems?\n\nA: In the Screen Sharing app, go to the View menu and click \"Customize Toolbar...\" There's a button you can add to the toolbar called \"Cursor\" that toggles your Mac's mouse cursor. You can turn it off so you'll only see the one on the remote machine instead of both the remote and local cursor.\n\nA: think this double pointer has something to do with your screen resolution but not the size of the screen. but where it says make text larger or smaller , reduce the percentage back to 100 maybe higer but at 200% of the normal size , the mouse becomes distorted and are inches apart.\n", "Q: Bootcamp - safety of OSX partition I use OSX and Windows 7 on my MBA.

However, there also files with similar names in a subfolder, that I do not want to open.\nI would like the action to search only in the main folder, and to disregard the content of any subfolders. Is there a way to do this in Automator?\n\nA: yes use the action \"Ask for Folder Contents\" (i hope its called like that on an English OS - I'm currently on a German one there it is called \"Ordnerinhalt abfragen\"), there you can say if you also wanna use subfolders or not.\nI added a demo workflow for you.\nDemo Workflow\n", "Q: Xcode 5.1.1 update error persists I'm running OS X Lion in VirtualBox on Windows 8 (I know, that's cheating, sorry :) to be able to use Xcode.

This includes other applications that use HTTP such as the Twitter official app and the App Store.\nThese sites work fine using the Tor Browser Bundle, and other machines on my network seem to have no issues. This problem persists across other networks and ISPs (Tested with Verizon fios and Time Warner cable.)\nIf I attempt to traceroute an unencrypted site (for example, honda.com) it ceases to progress after hitting vlan38.dca2a-fdisa-sw2-msfc1.netsrv.digex.net (164.109.3.146)\nEdit: Problem persists with both Root account and freshly created non-administrative user account.\nEdit2: All proxy settings have been disabled, both in wireless settings and Firefox.

Am I missing something or is the search function in the special characters window not very helpful?  For example, I'm editing text and I want to insert the character for π (pi), so I select \"Special Characters...\" from the menu and get the window.  Then I type \"pi\" in the search field and get the following, which is not helpful.\n\nNext I try \"greek pi\".  The search results are still surprisingly useless, but it did find a character with name \"greek pi symbol\".  It failed to find the characters I really wanted because they have names like \"greek small letter pi\"\n\n\nSo to find the character you need to know it's exact unicode name? That doesn't seem right. Is there a better way to search for a character?  \nThis is OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: Ctrl+Option+Space in 10.9.x brings up a quick access to special characters in line where you're typing —throughout most every app.\nThe search algorithm is the same of course, which it seems relies on how the charicter is tagged rather than a smart search throughout.\nStill, in general, I have found the quick access shortcut and search to work well for most things. If you start typing while the special char fly out is open it will run a search.\nInterestingly, While it seems that some older special characters like π have names that need to be entered exactly to search for them  \"small greek letter pi = π\", emoji will display if just part of the name is searched. \"Person with blond hair=\" can be searched just by typing in blond.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Using Iphone as bluetooth replacement for mac I have a late 2011 mac book pro with bluetooth 2.1 which works terribly with my speakers.

The script runs perfectly fine in the editor using this code:\ntell application \"App\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"App\"\n    set position of window 1 to {8, 22}\nend tell\ntell application \"App 2\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"App 2\"\n    set position of window 1 to {914, 22}\nend tell\n\nIt is not a scriptable app so I am using System events (I also changed the CFBundleName of the second app, so that it includes the 2 to differentiate the processes).  This all works fine in the editor when I run it.  However, when I save the script as an Application it consistently removes the \"2\" from \"App 2\" whenever I save the application, even though it compiles fine.  Does anyone have any idea why this is happening; I'm fairly new to Applescript.\n\nA: You can avoid the problem at compile by dynamically choosing the apps in system events.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set App1 to (first process whose name is \"App\")\n    tell App1\n        set frontmost to true\n        set position of window 1 to {8, 22}\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThen do the same for App2.\n\nA: The main Problem is that Apple Script Editor doesn't know any of the Names \"App\" nor \"App 2\" so if you run the script it asks you to select where App is stored and then replaces \"App\" with the Actual Name of the Application. This also happens for \"App 2\".\nSo if you two times select the same Application (which is what you're trying to do, according to your mentions) it will both times remove the Names \"App\" and \"App 2\" with the same Name of the Actual Application.\nOr if you use App as an Abbrevation for the Actual Name of the Application it knows the Application in First Statement but not in the Second so it will Ask just one time and just replace the \"App 2\".\nTo do what you want i recommend you to change your Script to something like this and try it that way (not tested):\ntell application \"<Name of Application>\" to activate --open first Window\ntell application \"<Name of Application>\" to activate --open second Window\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell application process \"<Name of Application>\"\n    set position of window 1 to {8, 22}\n    set position of window 2 to {914, 22}\nend tell\n\nif this doesn't work maybe you can adopt this Script which moves two open Finder Windows Side by Side.\nproperty monitor_width : 980\nproperty monitor_height : 768\n\nset the startup_disk to (path to startup disk)\n\ntell application \"Finder\" activate\n    set visible of (every process whose visible is true and frontmost is false) to false\n    -- BOTTOM WINDOW\n    set this_window to make new Finder window\n    set the target of this_window to the startup_disk\n    set the bounds of this_window to {0, (monitor_height * 0.55) div 1, monitor_width, monitor_height}\n    set the current view of this_window to column view\n    -- TOP WINDOW\n    set this_window to make new Finder window\n    set the target of this_window to the startup_disk\n    set the bounds of this_window to {0, (monitor_height * 0.06) div 1, monitor_width, (monitor_height * 0.53) div 1}\n    set the current view of this_window to column view\nend tell\n\nSource: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20011127022706921\n", "Q: How to handle Numbers' automatic Data Formatting? I'm trying to put together a sheet that calculates hours I work. One thing I want to do is calculate hours that are billable. So I have something like this:\n\nThings that aren't billable or are already billed go to 0.\nHowever, I'm having a problem with either the zeros that are generated or the field that adds them all together:\n\n\"Durations can't be compared to other data types.\" Here's my formula for the cell:\n\nSo, either the second value in the COUNTIF is giving me problems or the zeros above are (which is possible, since doing a simple SUM with a 0 value won't work either).\nHow do I deal with this? If I try to set the 0 cells or the sum cell at the bottom to the Data Format \"Duration,\" it overrides my selection. \nIs there a way to force a data format onto a cell with a formula?\nIf this is more suited to Super User, feel free to transfer.\n\nA: Without access to the spreadsheet that you've shown, I've attempted to recreate this myself. It appears that there are two things wrong with the spreadsheet above:\n\n\n*\n\n*The test-array for the countif is of Data Format Automatic. This means that the zeros are not of format Duration and can't be compared by the countif.\nTo fix this, select the entire array and choose Duration from the Data Format list.\n\n*The countif's condition is of format Number whereas the test-array is of format Duration.\nTo fix this, use the following for the countif cell:\n=COUNTIF(G2:G11,\">0h 0m\")\n\n", "Q: When restoring iPhone backup, asked for *previous* iCloud accounts? I've been using my username@outlook.com Apple ID on my iPhone for over 2 years. \nPrior to that I had username@gmail.com and before that I had username@yahoo.com as my prev Apple IDs. \nWhen I'm restoring my iPhone backup, I was asked for my current Apple ID (the outlook.com - makes sense) but ALSO was asked for the passwords for the older accounts (unused gmail.com and yahoo.com based iCloud accounts). \nI guess it's asking because I had apps purchases from those Apple IDs still on my phone so I just hit \"skip\".\nIs there a way for me to\n\n\n*\n\n*See which apps are still linked to my no longer used Apple IDs\n\n*Move those app purchases over to my newest Apple ID\n\n*Remove those older Apple IDs from future backups (so future restores don't bug me like this)\n\n\nA: \n  1. See which apps are still linked to my no longer used Apple IDs\n\nWhilst there's no 'list' of these apps, you should be able to notice apps which haven't been restored to the device, as these will be apps purchased with those Apple IDs. If you're watching the device being restored, you may notice such apps move straight from Waiting… to being deleted—this is a sign of an app which is not permitted to be installed.\n\n  2. Move those app purchases over to my me Apple ID\n\nThere is no automatic process for this. You'll need to find apps which aren't installed and you remember being installed (or you see not being installed per the previous paragraph) and reinstall them, whilst being signed in to your newer Apple ID.\n\n  3. Remove those older Apple IDs from future backups\n\nAs these apps have not been installed, future backups won't be aware of these apps ever existing and consequently you won't be prompted for the Apple IDs again.\n", "Q: Controlling MacMini volume with MacBookPro volume keys?

I would use their documentation, etc. but nobody knows what this error code is so I wanted to seek the geniuses here and I think it likely that others must have had this problem.\nWhen I’ve used this scanner with another computer it works fine.\nI have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software many times, but I’m not sure I’ve completely uninstalled the software because it still retains my custom profile, which I believe may be the source of the problem. Maybe that would be a great first step is to get a complete list of the files to uninstall, since there must be at least a portion of it which is manual.\n\nTime-out occurred during communication. (0xd0020002)\n\n\n\n\nA: I have one of these scanners and have noticed it can be sensitive to how it's connected on the USB bus. If the problem continues, try connecting it directly to a USB port on your Mac instead of through a hub (if it's not already directly connected).\n\nA: There is a more recent update to your scanner software.

Yesterday, I started downloading XCode 5.1.1 from the App Store.\nI have a very slow + limited bandwidth Internet connection. It took almost 5+ hours to download 1.6GB of data. It was really late in the night, and my new MBA had been up for over 7 hours, so I \"paused\" the download, shutdown the MBA, shut off my modem and went to bed.\nAfter waking up today morning, I decided to resume the XCode 5.1.1 download from App store. I figured I just needed to download another 600 MB to complete the ~2.2 GB XCode 5.1.1 download. So, I switched on the modem, switched on the MBA, opened the App Store and went to my purchases. When I hit the \"Resume\" download button on XCode 5.1.1 (in App Store->Purchases), the App store asked me for my Apple ID and password. I entered it and then the App Store \"restarted\" the download!!! All of the  1.6GB part that I had downloaded yesterday night was GONE!!!\nWith my metered connection, the App store now says it will take another 11 hours to download the ~2.2GB of data it needs to install XCode 5.1.1 on my MBA.\nQuestion: What gives? What happened to my 1.6GB of already downloaded data? Is the App Store going to trouble me like this all the time in the future?\n\nA: The PAUSED download is not the same as STOPPED.\nYou stopped the download (disconnected) so the temporary download file was deleted.\nThe resume function does not work for that.\n", "Q: How to specify DNS on iOS when connected via VPN? I have set up a VPN connection using my FritzBox 6330. This works great on my Macbook Air if I specify a DNS server (192.168.178.1 - which is the address of my FritzBox) in the network settings of the VPN.\nOn iOS however there is no such entry field, hence no names can  be resolved. The VPN itself works. I can connect to various IP addresses.\n\nA: The DNS settings over a VPN connection should be forced by the VPN server. This makes sure DNS queries get routed securely over the VPN, and allows you to see private services on the intranet that may not be exposed as public DNS records.\nIt's possible the VPN server may not be telling iOS what DNS server to use, something that could be solved by a configuration change in the VPN server?\n\nA: When using IKEv2, iOS ignores pushed DNS settings when split-include tunnelling is used.\n\nA: See complete Answer here:\n\nThe Wi-Fi settings are easy to override using the device itself, but\n  it's not global but instead an override on a per-network name basis.\n  Go to the network settings for a specific Wi-Fi. Under the detailed\n  screen (tap the blue > sign once you are connected) and swipe up to\n  expose the DHCP / BootP / Static IP address part of the screen. You\n  can tap to edit DNS and append, delete or substitute your choice of\n  DNS settings from that screen.\nWhen I need to run a custom DNS, I often use VPN to get to a router\n  with known settings and this works over Wi-Fi and cellular data since\n  all traffic goes to the VPN where I can control the DNS.

It charged up fairly quickly (I didn't time that, however) and the device functions fine.\nI used it off and on for a total of around 40-45 minutes this morning -- usual web surfing with maybe 2-3 minutes of video, max.

After 8 hours away at my office, I came back to find it at 70% (down from 75%).\nQuestion Should the lack of charge out of the box be reason enough to return this thing? And is the draw-down on power I described indicative of the normal, expected battery performance?\n\nA: Best is to use Apple tools already on your Mac to check your battery.\nOpen Activity in utility folder- and look under the the Energy tab.\n\nNext, open About this Mac- More- sys report:\nLook for battery information there.\nIt should show something like: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully charged capacity (>6500 mah), --that is a good indicator how \"old\" is the battery, the older they get the lower is the Fully Charged capacity number.\n\n*Look at the charge cycles (<5)- a good indicator how many times the battery was charged, with normal life been 1000 Cycles (or 3-5 years)\n", "Q: How can I delete a partition (coreStorage logical volume?) from the Terminal? I finally understood why Disk Utility will not change the partitions on my HDD, even though I added the most recent one myself (maybe significant: to test Yosemite DP) with it. Now I see it says it won't change either partition, because it has encrypted data and CoreStorage objects. It tells me vaguely to use diskutil from the command line for this, but this makes me a bit uncomfortable. I found a very similar question here,  with a great but incomplete answer about how to resolve this.

Use mysms.com, register your mobile number and login through that.  After that, you can send sms from your computer, which will get routed through your phone, which means you have to have your phone and the computer connected to the internet.

At one point I began to systematically test various searches to try to determine some basic patterns so I could be certain that the resulting files contained every (or even \"the specific\") file I was looking for.  I found that there were so many things that could subtly affect a search (such as word order, capitalization, differences between the use of numeric and alphabetic characters, using partial words that matched the beginning of piece of metadata versus a substring that would match within a the same attribute, quotes and double quotes, unmatched quotes, the various logical operators [AND, OR, NOT or &, |, ^ or &&, ||, or some or all of these so I can never quite remember the right form to use], the various \"names\" for pieces of metadata such as \"date:\" or \"kind:\" or many others, the complete list hidden away from most users abilities to find)…well, basically I learned a few things I could count on but I wonder if there is anyone who could actually predict the exact results of all but the most basic search. And then I’ve run basic searches that produce lists of files that I’m sure are missing some files that should be found or missing others that should be there and yet I’m not sure why.  Sometimes after time spent staring at the results I can see what happened; sometimes I never do.\nAll that is to say I am also bothered by inconsistencies for certain types of searches that I want or want to depend on being complete (as I think you are looking for yourself).  On the other hand, these same search tools are so essential to the ease of use of my Mac that I’d truly miss them if they were unavailable (at times I’ve been amazed at what I could find such as older pieces of my writing that were in files which had lost their filenames due to accidental deletion yet with a few key words could be quickly located.)  I have also watched people I know looking for files on a PC running Windows and think, \"why don’t you just search for it?\"  Then I recall how I often avoided using the files searching facilities when Windows was my main OS.\nI believe that Apple’s search facilities will probably not be satisfactory to what you want, at least when used \"intuitively.\"  That said, there are different commands that can be run using terminal that may allow you to get better results in your case, but that can only be determined by trial and error.  Their value, though, can be in providing ways to see exactly what metadata exists for some file which you feel is left out of the results of a search and whether the desired type of data is missing or a particular matching type of data is missing or otherwise.  The various system commands are those like mdutil and mdls and possibly other related commands.  I usually run man for one of these, such as man mdls and then refer to the related commands at the end of the manual page under the SEE ALSO heading.  The difficulty is that the learning curve can be steep depending on how far you wish to delve into the various search techniques.  Often the hardest aspect is not in knowing how to run a type of search but more in being able to find out the various names of the search keys to search on, which may require running other md… commands to dump certain keys and/or values of the system metadata.\nAlong with all of the basic unknown factors there is always the possibility that the metadata store is corrupt or not complete and needs to be rebuilt.  And then, too, the metadata is extracted from files as they are created or changed by various \"modules\" each of which handles some particular type or types of metadata extraction.  Many of these modules are provided by Apple and many come from various vendors to allow different types of files to be processed and different attributes collected.  So problems my exist in the metadata collection just as they might in the search facilities.  That’s where some system commands can help one to see just what is wrong with the files metadata or a particular query string. \nIf you are basically interested in searching for PDF files and the Adobe search features meet your needs I’d probably suggest going with those (or perhaps other third party search tools that may have a more defined and predictable search methodology).  And use Apple’s search facilities for what they can help with (and in many cases, despite possibly not returning every desired file, can produce \"fuzzier\" results that can help to form a better query for use in an alternate search engine).\nSorry to go on without being able to give more useful ideas but I hope some of what I’ve said helps you to decide upon a method that works for you.  (I love my Mac…most likely will always use a Mac…but sometimes I think that Apple doesn’t document parts of OS X just so it’s never possible to point at something and say it doesn’t work right, since it might work exactly as it was intended. You never actually know for sure!)\n", "Q: Error-\"Unable to write to the last block of the device.\" I am trying to setup a new hard drive into my Macbook Pro. However, I keep getting an error in disk utility that states, \"Unable to write to the last block of the device.\" I saw another person was able to solve this by replacing a dead hd cable. Could someone explain what they meant by dead hd cable, or have any other ideas on how to fix this? Thanks for the help\n\nA: Testing cabling is more of an empirical exercise. First you disconnect and reseat both ends of the cable. Next, you put in the new cable and if the problem goes away it was the cable. If you suspect the cable on an intermittent problem you replace the cable and leave it in after reseating doesn't reduce the frequency of the issue.\nI'd start with reseating things and re-testing. Since you have a good test you'll know pretty quickly if it's the drive, the cable or the driver board / software that's causing the write failure.\nAlso, check that the drive has updated firmware / appropriate firmware for your version of OS.\n\nA: The HDD cable physically attaches the internal drive (2.5'' 9mm traditionally for notebooks) to the logicboard, typically via the SATA (II or III) bus. The cable can wear out and cause I/O problems, such as you've as described. \nHere is an image of the cable via iFixit. I added brief descriptions:\n\nUsing iFixit, identify your machine's model and find the applicable replacement guide for the cable (example). In the guide's preface, see \"relevant parts\" for the compatible cable and necessary tools. Prices range from $30-$50. Follow the step by step guide carefully and replace the cable.\nIf you still have the same issue after doing so, the drive itself is defective and should be returned. \n", "Q: Terminal sometimes scrambles initial output I switched to iTerm 2 a while ago, but would like to fix this small problem that I have with OS X's built-in Terminal.\nTerminal is supposed to look like this when it first opens on my machine:\n\nHowever, I am frequently met with the following output:\n\nAnd more infrequently (but still reproducible enough):\n\nMy .bash_profile file consists of a bunch of aliases and one defined function for calculating battery life from the shell. I am able to reproduce the issue with no .bash_profile at all. .bashrc is empty.\nWhat is the cause of this issue, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I would like to answer my own question, even though it is not an \"answer,\" per se.\nAfter testing on several different machines, I am confident that this is a bug with Terminal (and perhaps other virtual terminals on other operating systems). I have tested this on the following machines that are owned by separate users:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (2012, 13-inch) running 10.9.4\n\n*MacBook Air (2012) running 10.9.3\n\n*MacBook Pro (2012, 15-inch) running 10.9.4\n\n\nIf someone would like to add to my list, please try running Terminal and quitting it in succession until you see the timestamp located on the same line as the initial prompt.\nA friend of mine claims to have seen this on Linux as well. \n\nA: Bash is doing this. It's sending a command to the terminal to move the cursor to the first line. It only does this occasionally, and I have not been able to figure out why yet, but I suspect it may depend on when bash receives and processes the first SIGWINCH signal, which informs it of the terminal size. It may be that if it receives SIGWINCH at a different time, it thinks the terminal has resized and it needs to move the cursor up.\n[Bash version 3.2.57 on OS X.]\n", "Q: Possible to charge iPhone through other means? I am too cheap to purchase a USB charging connector for my iPhone, so I was wondering if there's a way to create a USB cable at home or use some other USB cable and get the job done safely.\nFor example will other USBs, assuming the connectors fit, charge, or no? I figure they would since they are just USB 2.0 based and iPhone can't tell the difference from its hardware perspective.\nA better way to look at this: any other way to charge an iPhone without an iPhone-specific charger? I heard it's possible to use a wind turbine or dynamometer, but those are not inexpensive. Could those be replicated at home with typical at home tools? For example could I make a crank device that delivers powered-charge through the USB to the iPhone's battery?\n\nA: Yes it is possible, but consider the consumption and Costs.\nHow much electricity does it take to power your iPhone for a year? \nThe answer: 1 kWh.\nThis is the amount of electricity you’d need to power ten 100-watt incandescent light-bulbs for an hour. \nFar from anything worth being sheepish over, 1 kwh costs about 12 cents.\nTo be specific, your iPhone battery holds a charge of 1,440 mAh, or about 5.45 watt hours. If you fully drained and recharged your phone everyday, then over the course of a year you would have to feed it about 2,000 watt hours, or 2kWh = 25 Cents per Year.\nAs for your iPad, keeping it fed costs just $1.36 a year, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. \nYour average laptop, with its far bigger screen, uses about 72 kWh, costing some $8 a year.\nThere is your challenge:\nMake a power station that has a ROI such to recover the cost using the 25 cents per Year returns.\nAnswer: if it cost you $20 to make the power station- it will take about 40 Years before you see benefit.\n", "Q: External HD has disappeared from Finder I believe I created this problem.

Once loaded, from the main pane select \"Reinstall OSX\" and then select your internal drive as the destination. \n\nIf so, can I use it, delete all of my partitions, and reinstall Mac OS\n  X mavericks and will that installation also make a Recovery HD\n  partition?\n\nYes, if you wish, however you will lose all data on the internal drive during a clean wipe (reformat) and reinstallation. The reformat will wipe the drive. The reinstallation will reinstall OSX onto the boot volume, as well as recreating both the default EFI and Recovery partitions. To do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Internet Recovery as mentioned above\n\n*Open \"Disk Utility\" from the main pane.  \n\n*select the whole boot Drive [IE 120 GB Apple SSD] > Erase tab > Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) > click \"Erase...\"\n\n*The drive is now reformatted and completely blank. \n\n*Exit \"Disk Utility\" and Open \"Reinstall OSX\"\n\n*Select the Internal drive and let OS X install. Upon completion, the machine will reboot normally and you will be greeted with the Setup Assistant process. \n\n", "Q: Access IPhone in Finder Is there a way to access iPhone in Finder, similar to the way Windows can access it in Explorer? Going through some growing pains in doing things the \"apple way\" ...\n\nA: Generally without jailbreaking the device, no. Apple makes it quite difficult to access the filesystem of your iOS device - whether attempting to navigate directories on the device directly, or remotely from your computer.\nHowever, there are certain programs recently made available which enable one to do so. For example, iFunBox is an iOS file management application for your desktop that allows you to browse and manipulate the filesystem without jailbreaking the phone.\nAdditionally, you may find it helpful to use iOS's Spotlight feature to quickly find and access content on your device:\n\n\"To access Spotlight, swipe down on your home screen to reveal the search field.\"\n\"Spotlight searches certain text fields in the content of your device for text beginning with your search phrase. It is not case-sensitive, so you can search using uppercase or lowercase letters and get the same results.\"\n\n\nA: I've been trying to do so for a while now, I think the only way to get a third party app like iExplorer and then find the file. If the file isn't using file sharing, you can make a backup of your phone and find the file in there.\nBut the only way to edit the files would be to make the iphone backup, then use a third party app (I recommend iExplorer) to find the file, then right click and choose show in finder, now you have the file and permission to edit it. once you are done, You need to restore your iphone to THAT backup, now your changes are saved.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut to open context menu Does OS X have a Windows Shift + F10 equivalent? I need a keyboard shortcut to open the context menu without a mouse.\n\nA: As far as I can see, you have two options.\nMouse Keys\nWhen using Mouse Keys, you can use the keyboard to move the cursor. If you have a numerical keypad, the numbers around 5 are used to move it and 5 is used to click. Without a keypad, it's mapped to the nine keys surrounding I (789/UIO/JKL).\nJust like with a mouse or trackpad, you can hold ⌃ control while pressing 5 or I to bring up the context menu.\nYou can turn on Mouse Keys in System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad, or enable the press-shift-five-times toggle shortcut, or press ⌥+⌘+F5 to bring up a window of Accessibility toggles, including Mouse Keys. This is important to know, as Mouse Keys makes typing impossible, at least without a number pad.\n\nThird party utility\nThere are many applications that let you customize keyboard shortcuts, etc. There's BetterTouchTool (free), or Keyboard Maestro ($36), or several others. Any of these should let you create a shortcut to “right-click”.\n\n", "Q: Can I remove battery while my iPhone 4s is still on? I've had this annoying problem with my phone that has happened a few times now. Basically it just totally freezes. My top button is broken, so I can't turn the phone off using that. My assisted touch no longer works, because the screen is pretty much completely frozen. \nIn the past the only way I've been able to really deal with this problem is by draining the battery and then plugging my phone in to turn it on. This seems to reset it and then it works again. In order to drain my battery I can either ask Siri questions (but unfortunately this also stops working after a while...plus it's annoying as hell), or play music from my iTunes. Playing music from my iTunes does the trick, but it usually takes almost 24 hours to completely drain my battery. Suggestions on draining faster are appreciated...\nFor today though, I have my first day of work tomorrow and it just went out. I kind of really wanted to have a functional phone for my first day, so I'm a little more desperate. I'm wondering if it would be okay to remove the battery/unplug it and put it back in while my phone is in the frozen state. Obviously the whole phone isn't frozen since it can play music, but the screen and all buttons just don't work. Could this break my phone? Do I have a pretty good chance of nothing bad happening? Thanks lemme knowww.\n\nA: It should be possible to perform a reset of the phone by holding the 'home' and 'power' buttons for ten seconds. That should cause the phone to reboot.\nIf you can't do this (e.g. broken power button), then I don't see why removing the battery would not cause the phone to be shut down.\nI don't see why it would cause any lasting damage, at any rate.\n\nA: I had the same problem a few hours ago. Removing and placing the battery seems to fix the problem. Not sure how long though, but it did helped.\n", "Q: MacBook with Windows keyboard Problem occurs when pressing the @ and the \" keys.  They seem to be mapped to each other, so @ -> \" and \" -> @.\nThe system preferences allow modifier keys to be re-mapped but not these two.\nCan it be done? \n\nA: That sounds like the main difference between a US and a UK keyboard. On a UK keyboard the \" is above the number 2, and on a US keyboard the @ is above the 2.\nIs the keyboard UK or US?\nAnd is the Mac set to have a UK or a US keyboard attached?\n\nA: use keyremap4macbook. It adds all these options and it's easy to add new mappings on your own - eg for media keys and so on. Also you can make the remaps device specific so a mac keyboard will work as usual.\n", "Q: Enable SMB sharing from command line On OS X 10.8, using terminal commands, I'd like to enable SMB sharing as if I had ticked the following checkbox under System Preferences - Sharing - File Sharing - Options:\n\nI've tried the following command:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\nBut despite the smb daemon seeming to be up and running, the checkbox is still unchecked, as if something is missing.\nThe same command works, as an example, for screen sharing (com.apple.screensharing.plist) and even for AFP (com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist), only SMB seem to suffer from this problem.\n\nA: I've found the solution. Two commands are needed in sequence:\nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server.plist EnabledServices -array disk\n\n\nA: For others who might be having this same issue with a different root cause, I found that somehow my com.apple.smbd.plist file had gotten corrupt.\nYou can check this with cat /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist.\nIt should appear to be plain text, but if you see a bunch of weird characters, it's probably corrupt.\nI simply deleted the file [and after realizing it did not get recreated on reboot] copied my com.apple.smbd.plist from another Mac into /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/.  Then I checked the checkbox (or alternately, you could run sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist), and then rebooted.\nProblem solved.  Same issue, different root cause.\nEdit: You should also verify permissions on com.apple.smbd.plist and com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist, especially if copying from a different computer.  I discovered that my com.apple.AppleFileSharing.plist file had 777 permission, which was causing it not to load.\nOwnership should be root:wheel, and permissions should be 644:\nsudo chown root:wheel /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\nsudo chown root:wheel /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist\nsudo chmod 644 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist\nsudo chmod 644 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.AppleFileServer.plist\n\n\nA: I came looking for a new approach that would work on macOS 13 (Ventura) and use the modern launchctl syntax. None of the above are working for me.\nI'm close with the script below.\nsudo launchctl enable system/com.apple.smbd \nsudo launchctl bootstrap system /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist \nsudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.apple.smbd\n\nIt does turn on SMB, and the File Sharing toggle in System Settings does flip to the \"on\" position. But something isn't right with the smbd daemon permissions when invoked this way. Connections from my iOS devices fail in strange ways, certain directories can't be traversed, etc.\nOne significant thing I discovered is, when toggling File Sharing on via the GUI, running pgrep -lf smbd yields no results. Some other daemon besides /usr/sbin/smbd appears to be providing the service. But sudo lsof -Pi :445 does not reveal which particular binary has the port open.\nI'm hoping someone might be able to build on this and figure out the missing piece.\n", "Q: Disable bluetooth keyboard for second mac I've searched through some sites and couldn't find any solution for my problem, so finally landed here :)\nI have two mac's in my job - one has bluetooth keyboard, one wired. I want to permanently disable bluetooth keyboard for that with wired keyboard. Now it automatically pairs with Mac which is first turned on. How I can do that?\nThanks!\n\nA: On the second Mac, under System Preferences > Bluetooth > \"Paired Devices\" > right click (or control + click) the device (keyboard) > Remove. You must be connected to bluetooth to remove the device. \nUnder \"Advanced\" uncheck \"Open Bluetooth Setup Assistant at Startup if No Keyboard is Connected\"\nSubsequently, you can disable Bluetooth altogether in the same pane > \"Turn Bluetooth Off.\"\n", "Q: OS X 10.9.3 has two visible cursors Basicaly my problem is, that when i mouse over some text, the default \"text-selection\" cursor appears. But the mouse pointer (arrow) is still present and i can see two cursors.\nWhat could be causing this? It seems to happen when i \"lock\" my mac with the login window and then logging in.\nHelp?\nI'm using OSX 10.9.3 on a late 2013 13\" macbook pro with retina display and two atached monitors (one on a thunderbolt->DVI connection and another connected via the HDMI out)\n\nA: It just happened to me on 10.9.5 for the first time; don't know what caused it but unplugging the external monitor and then plugging it back again helped.\n\nA: I am trying to figure this out as well -- it isn't just the the text selection cursor, but I think any cursor. I guess the problem is that the primary cursor doesn't disappear consistently. (It goes away when I start typing, but not while the mouse is moving.) I have 3 possibly related situations, only the last one (remote screen) has started recently:\n\n\n*\n\n*big cursor\n\n*two displays\n\n*remote screen\n\n\nI always use a larger-than-normal cursor, to find it on big displays. When I go to the Accessibility panel to reduce the cursor size now, it doesn't go down to the smallest size any more. \nI've been running with two displays a long time without problem, but recently I started using Apple's remote screen capability. (I'm on a 2012 27\" iMac, running 10.9.5.) I've used it in lots of different configs this week (one display, two displays, second display powered on or off).\nForce-quit of system preferences doesn't fix the problem, but restarting did. Now my cursor is small and there's only one at a time. Increased the cursor size, still no problem. \nSo my bet is this is a minor bug with the Accessibility software interacting with remote display usage. But hey, your mileage may vary.\n\nA: I see the same thing here on OSX 10.11.6\nI have an external monitor so all I have to do is unplug and replug the monitor back in and the problem goes away.\n\nA: I had a double cursor, or it looked like a cursor and a \"shadow\" on my external monitor.  \nIt was on both my laptop display and the external monitor.\nI unplugged the external monitor and the cursor was fine on the laptop.  Plug the external monitor back it, now it's 50/50 - move to the MacBook display, single cursor - back to external monitor, double cursor - back to the MacBook display, single cursor - back to external monitor, double cursor, etc.  \nI clicked the Apple symbol, System Preferences, Accessibility, then reduced the cursor size and then increased it again, problem solved. \nSo, it's a software bug.  I'm running a MacBook Pro 17 inch late 2011 with Sierra 12.12.2 Beta\n\nA: Same problem here.  I'm using 10.12.2 and an external display (laptop closed).  I went into the accessibility and moved the cursor size slider up and down and problem fixed itself.\n", "Q: How do I require password prompt EVERY time I close my MacBook's lid? This doesn't seem to always work. \nAlso (perhaps related?): when I close the lid of the laptop when it's connected to the Thunderbolt display, how do I make the display go black? \nBasically, I am trying to increase security on my setup overall, if I leave my desk.\n\nA: You can't be 100% sure that the display will lock when closing the lid.\nThe only way you can be sure is to lock the screen before you close the lid and then close it. I use LaunchBar to lock the screen with key commands and/or sleep the OS.\nThe exceptions to locking are when the machine detects that a closed clamshell event has happened (connected to power, USB and an external display) while the system detects the lid closed.\nThe other exception is when the sleep sensor doesn't trigger (or was triggered and dismissed) or the system doesn't process that signal in a timely fashion. I have seen times when the OS is blocked enough to not sleep the lid for some time or even some hours when the system was frozen. They are rare, but do happen from time to time. Also, the hardware itself can become faulty or inconsistent even when the software is processing all SMC / environment signals properly and in a timely fashion.\nThere are many threads here covering these details:\n\n\n*\n\n*My MacBook Pro is not sleeping when I close the lid on battery\n\n*Macbook doesn't stay asleep when lid is closed\n\n*Why won't closing the lid sleep my MacBook Pro with external monitor attached after upgrading to Lion?\n\n*Is there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid?\n\n*How do I require password prompt EVERY time I close my MacBook's lid?\n\n*Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook that lack eject keys?\nThe last question explains how Control + Shift + Power keys along with the setting to require a password immediately will rapidly put your Mac in a secure state requiring a password to use it.\n\nA: Your question specifically asked for making your MacBook more secure when you leave your desk. Here are a couple more suggestions for you to consider depending our your needs: \nIn Keychain Access.app each Keychain can have its own lock settings. By default you should have a login and a System keychain. Right click on the keychain and you can set it to Auto-lock immediately on Sleep. Or you can set an inactivity timer. Thus, you can lock your Keychain independently of other system wide locking settings. Additionally, you can create different keychains with their own locking timings based on the importance of the credentials you save.\nYou can look at various apps that Lock your system based on the proximity a BlueTooth device such as your smartphone. You can find several of these apps in the Mac App Store or via MacUpdate.com. However, most of these apps seem to have poor reviews. \n10 years ago I had such a system setup with my first Nokia with Bluetooth, the Salling Clicker app and an AppleScript. Today, I would use EventsScripts to trigger a locking script when your BlueTooth phone is out of range. To prevent false triggers, EventScripts allows you to set the BlueTooth signal sensitivity and how many times to retry before triggering a script. You would use this scripting to lock the screen: \ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/'Menu Extras'/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\nSuch a BlueTooth based trigger is not perfect, but it does add another layer of automation to secure your Mac without you having to remember to take action.\n\nA: If you want to make sure the external display goes to sleep when you close your macbook, make sure you don't have a power adapter, external keyboard, or mouse connected, then close the lid. \nReference:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3131\nIf you want the machine to require password after you sleep it:  \n\n", "Q: Exchange calendar listed twice I have one (just one) Exchange account configured:\n\nBut Calendar shows it twice:\n\nIn the Accounts tab of the Calendar preferences it also listed twice:\n\nand if I try to remove one of them I am redirected to the Internet Accounts settings (where only one is listed).\n\nIs there a fix or should I completely remove the Exchange account and add it again?\n\nA: Following the discussion suggested in the comments I was able to find a partial solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Internet Accounts preferences (system-wide) uncheck the Calendars option from the Exchange account\n\n*In the preferences of the Calendars application choose the Accounts tab and disable the only visible account\n\n*In the system-wide Internet Accounts preferences re-enable the exchange account\n\n\nThe only drawback is that you will still see a disable Exchange account in your Calendars preferences.\n", "Q: Fit 2 video clips in iMovie side by side without cropping When using iMovie's side-by-side feature, it cropped the clips automatically by default.

Some say that you need to make a new iCloud email. But that doesn't seems to be a solution because I use that iCloud email with all my devices. \nHow can I find the problem in iCloud?\n\nA: I would connect to a fast WiFi and re-enable iCloud. The WiFi will drain the battery far less than the cellular modem for transferring 1 GB of data since it will finish much faster in most cases. Also, you might need to plug into power to let however much data you have sync.\nSome big items you can turn off temporarily are:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Stream\n\n*iCloud Backup\n\n*Any other large users of data from the settings app, iCloud and settings app, usage\n\n\nAnother thing you could try is to disable all iCloud settings, and enable them one by one. \nOnce the device is caught up, you can test the device on LTE/3G data without the power cord and WiFi to see that the battery usage isn't due to downloading a lot of data from the cloud or putting that data up in the cloud.\n\nA: Might be the Apple Remote app. After the last update, I started having problems with phone staying hot and battery life draining rapidly. The Remote app had turned itself on to \"stay connected\". I think the phone was constantly trying to sync with my home computer. After shutting off the app, phone immediately started cooling off.

I had set up FileVault 2 encryption while using long&strong user password, and later changed user password to a shorter one. At first time it seemed like everything is working as I expect: OS X asks for long password at power on (because this password was used to encrypt everything), and later I can unlock my gear with shorter password.\nBut today I noticed that I can use short password even after the system was powered down. This seems very suspicious! Why did it happen and how can I make sure that when powered off, the system is protected by the long password?\nI'm using OS X Mavericks 10.9.4.\n\nA: FileVault should use whatever is the current password for your account. When you change your user accounts password, FileVault will be updated with the new password. \nWe can get what you want — a long FileVault password and a short user account password — by creating two user accounts.\nWhen you first enable FileVault, only the user account that you use to start FileVault will be setup to unlock FileVault. You can use the FileVault System Preferences to add other accounts to unlock FileVault by selecting the user an entering their password. \nAfter FileVault has been enabled, any new users created will automatically allowed to unlocking FileVault. \nTo achieve your goal of having a very strong FileVault password and an easier to use User password we need to create a User with a strong password specifically to unlock FileVault, and remove all other users from FileVault.\nLets say you have enabled FileVault. Your current account is frank, and you have made frank's user password easy to type. \nNow create a new user account betty with a strong password. betty will be automatically added to unlock FileVault, and the only purpose of this account will be for unlocking FileVault, we will not need to actually use the account for anything else.\nFrom the command line, we can list the users who are setup to unlock FileVault:\n$ sudo fdesetup list\nbetty,########-####-####-####-############\nfrank,########-####-####-####-############\n\nHere the #'s are the UUID \nThe FileVault System preferences allow you to add accounts to unlock, but you need to use the command line to remove users from this list. Let's remove frank :\n$ sudo fdesetup remove -user frank\n\nAnd verify that worked:\n$ sudo fdesetup list\nbetty,########-####-####-####-############\n\nNow only betty can unlock FileVault. (Well of course, there is also the Recovery Key.) \nIf you ever add another new user account, you will need to remember to remove them from FileVault.\nAlso, if you want to make sure that betty is used only for unlocking disk (prevent login), you can disable its ability to login by changing its login shell to /usr/bin/false as described in this answer.\nEdit to add:\nCheck out Using fdesetup with Mountain Lion’s FileVault 2 which provides much detail about the fdesetup command. \n\nA: File vault 2 uses a master password(probably your long/strong password), but it also allows for any enabled user to unlock the system drive, strong password or not. The only users that you can't enable to unlock the drive are users with no password.\nI remember a while back reading a file vault vulnerability where an attacker would compromise a apple id account and force a password reset on a users account who could unlock a file vault 2 protected system. The attacker would then log in to the system and unlock the protected drive with the new password they previously created.\n", "Q: Is there a way to convert a video from iOS (QuickTime) format to Windows (WMV or AVI) format? I recently purchased an iPod 5 and had the opportunity to take videos with it. The videos are great; but, I have a problem.\nI would love to be able to convert these videos from their original Quick Time format to something that my computer \"prefers\" playing such as WAV or AVI.\nIs there a way to do this without using an online converter (which I would really prefer not doing)? I have immediate access to Windows Media Player, Movie Maker and Quick Time. Any help would be appreciated!\n\nA: Videos recorded with iOS (your iPod 5) have the extension \"MOV\", but they are normal \"MP4\" (containing H.264 and AAC). Which means that you can change the extension to \"MP4\" and they will be playable on Windows.\nIn this case (recorded on iOS and with the extension \"MOV\") it is not necessary to convert these files. Same for \"M4V\" and \"M4H\" (other extensions which are used sometimes by Apple products on iOS).\nThere are two ways to change the extension of a file for Mac users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Directly in the Finder\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file\n\n*Hit ENTER to edit the filename\n\n*Select the extension \"MOV\" (without \".\")\n\n*Change the extension to \"mp4\"\n\n*Hit ENTER to exit editing\n\n\n*In the Finder information window\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file\n\n*Select \"Information\" in the File menu (or press CMD + I)\n\n*Select the extension \"MOV\" (without \".\") in the field \"Name & Suffix\"\n\n*Change the extension to \"mp4\"\n\n*Close the information window\n\n\n\nBoth ways will show a dialog to confirm the changed extension.\nFor Windows users, please read the help from Microsoft.\nUppercase or lowercase of the extension is the same, but I prefer lowercase.\n\nA: For all conversion tasks, I like to recommend Handbrake.

I have a legal copy of Vista which I used to use before I had a drive failure on my mid 2010 27\" iMac. Since then I've installed OSX Mavericks, and now it's telling me that only Windows 7 and 8 are supported via Boot Camp. \nI tried circumventing this by booting from the Vista disk, but it won't let me install because now OSX uses GPT instead of MBR (or so it seems).

I can't recall if I first tried to navigate to a website or not. I am familiar with logging into hotspots, where the login details appear in the browser itself. In this case, however, the login details appeared in a separate window (program?).\nWhen I selected the browser, the global menu indicated \"Firefox\". When I selected the login window, the menu showed \"Finder\". Is this a (Apple?) captive portal program? It's the first time I've seen it on any OS platform.\n\nA: It's something built in the system . Sometimes it's able to detect a captive portal and it displays it in a separate window. \nAs @George Garside pointed out, it's a separate program located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app. \nAlso, if you have a iDevice you'll see a similar feature. \n", "Q: iOS 7 iAd Implementation & iAd Network Temporarily Unavailable I have submitted three iOS apps and they have all been approved.

You probably need some helper application that watches the process and stops it when you lock the screen.\nTaking this a step further : You could write a small programm/script that can check if your script is running and pause it, and when you are back at your desk and unlock the screen, it continues.\n", "Q: Mac Pro average lifetime? I am thinking of buying a new workstation computer, and Mac Pro is like the first thing I thought of buying. \nI know Apple supports their computers for quite a generous time period, like the mid-2007 iMac is still supported in Yosemite. However, I see that only models going forward from Early 2008 are supported for Mac Pro(source: http://www.ibtimes.com/os-x-yosemite-compatibility-find-out-if-your-mac-will-be-able-update-1594262). \nSo are Mac Pro's not supported for as long as iMac's or is there a different reason? How long are Mac Pro's generally supported for? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Well, the Mac Pro went through quite a long period of stagnancy recently, which is likely the cause of the disparity you see between the iMac and Mac Pro in terms of software compatibility.\nAccording to the MacRumors Buyer's Guide, the Mac Pro has by far the largest average time between refreshes (449 days), so new models are sparse.\nBecause of that, it's a good time to buy, if that's what you're asking. Though there could be a minor spec bump or price drop at any time (those are more or less unpredictable from afar), it's not worth the risk of waiting for one. The December 2013 update is likely the only major refresh we'll see for quite a while.\nAs far as average lifetime goes, the Early 2008 Mac Pro shipped with OS X Leopard (10.5), and is still supported in Yosemite (10.10), so it has received five software updates so far (and there could still be more). \nBased on that, you could expect software compatibility to last for upwards of 6 years on a Mac Pro bought today, if that's how you define lifetime. However, the Mac will of course function on old software for much longer than that.\n\nA: Typically, based on my personal experience, I'll expect between 5-8 years out of a Mac.\nTo dive deeper though you can see my answer to a previous question, concerning fixing older Macs, that explains Apple's three life cycles when dealing with Macs.\nBasically Apple supports Macs for a minimum of 5 years, though often longer, from a software standpoint.  Third party software vendors (Adobe, Microsoft, etc) typically follow this time frame as well.\nOn the hardware side of things Apple considers Macs age 0-5 to be current, meaning replacement parts and services are readily available if needed.  When a Mac is between 5 - 7 years old Apple considers it vintage, meaning they stop actively producing replacement parts and software support might start to trickle off.  When a Mac is over 7 years old it hits Obsolete status in Apple's system.  Obsolete Macs often have a hard time working with modern software, parts are scarce and more often than not unavailable from Apple and all support services from Apple cease.\nSpecific model Macs rarely deviate from these timelines, though as you found the early Mac Pro is one example in regards to software support.  This was one of those odd instances where it simply lacked the required architecture for 64 bit operating systems.  It's unlikely to see such a paradigm shift going forward, at least for the next 6-7 years.\nHopefully that explains it a bit better.\nSource - I worked in the Apple break/fix ecosystem for 6 years, for both an AASP and as a Mac Genius.\n\nA: Yosemite's system requirements are the same as those for Mavericks and Mountain Lion. According to Wikipedia:\n\nThe technical basis for these requirements is incompatibility with\n  32-bit EFI and 32-bit kernel extensions (most importantly, drivers for\n  GPUs shipped in some older Macs).\n\nIf you look at this list, you can see that the earliest Mac Pro supported by Yosemite (2008) is the first one that has 64-bit EFI and can boot in 64-bit mode.\nSo the support cutoff has nothing to do with it being a Mac Pro vs. an iMac or anything else; it just happens to be that the 2008 model is the first one that's technically compatible.\n\nA: The inclusion of Hyperthreading and Turbo Boost technologies as well as supporting DDR3 RAM and SATA HD's in a fully realized 64bit system with Quadcore processor(s) is the current benchmark for a Modern Desktop. Performance with these features, even at the first entry as can be seen in the stark differences between the 2008 2x2.8 Quad & 2009 2x2.93 Quad. Gains of  50% and higher are realized with a system that allows maximum expandibility (note here the 2014 MP powerhouse with no internal expansion) with a redesign that takes advantage of the technologies now commonplace in modern computing solutions. Hitting the thermal barrier, soon broken with the Skylake series of 16nm processors, multicore-multithreaded processors with smarttek such as Turbo allowing for single core clock gains of +30% are the current gold standard for  processor evolution. \nIt's interesting to note that in 2009 we had off the shelf consumer desktops with near 3.0ghz base clock speeds in Quadcore HT, TB Intel (x2) set ups supporting 64gb of RAM realizing dual 2x wide PCI GPU monsters, 4x1TB HD's and twin optical drives that allowed even more expansion with all the I/O needed. Dollar for dollar it was a golden era of expandable decade long lasting computing solutions. \nBut, come this fall my mobile will have the computing power of the entry level 09' laptops, so we are progressing!\n", "Q: 'localhost' stoped working as an alias for '127.0.0.1' for SSHing into my VirtualBox VM. Why, and how to fix? The question explains the problem. For months I've never had any problems along these lines. Then, yesterday morning, I couldn't get into my VM!

Here's the normal contents of /etc/hosts in OS X (as of Mavericks):\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.\n##\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n255.255.255.255 broadcasthost\n::1             localhost \nfe80::1%lo0     localhost\n\nNote that if you need to edit/recreate this file, it must be in plain text format (no formatting at all), with unix-style line endings (linefeeds). You can use a command line editor like vi or nano; if you want a GUI editor, I tend to recommend TextWrangler or its big brother BBEdit for editing files like this, since they're good about not adding spurious \"helpful\" things to the files you edit, and also can use admin rights to edit system files (like /etc/hosts).\n(Also, it's not really visible or important, but those are tab characters between the addresses and names.)\nFor testing lookups like this, use dscacheutil (dscacheutil -q host -a name localhost) instead of something like dig. The reason to use dscacheutil is that dig (and host and nsloogup) bypasses the system lookup policy and just checks DNS directly, while dscacheutil uses the full system lookup policy. As a result, dig won't see entries in /etc/hosts, or do mDNS (Bonjour) lookups, or look for Computer entries in directory services, or see cached entries from previous lookups, or...\nWhen you have the hosts file set up properly, here's what dscacheutil's output should look like:\n$ dscacheutil -q host -a name localhost\nname: localhost\nipv6_address: ::1\nipv6_address: fe80:1::1\n\nname: localhost\nip_address: 127.0.0.1\n\n", "Q: Cross Platform GUI-compatible Encryption I am looking for an encryption tool that is completely cross platform - effectively like FileVault or BitLocker but compatible with both operating systems. \nMy use case is that I'd like to encrypt a drive that is used heavily between two sites (it travels, hence the encryption) - one Mac and one Windows. Ideally, I'd like to encrypt the whole drive and when I plug it into either machine, it prompts me to enter a key of some form to decrypt it. \nI understand that TrueCrypt used to be a great way of doing this - but unfortunately it is no longer supported / developed (ref). I'm not at all adverse to using a command line to unlock and relock the drive provided it is fast enough to be relatively transparent.\nHas anyone else encountered this kind of thing / have any suggestions? I'm running Mavericks on all Macs and 8.1 on all Win machines. \nThanks!\n\nA: TrueCrypt 7.1a has gone through at least two audits. They found a couple of high-severity issues were found, but there are no known exploits against them, and one only affects the Windows version. And the one that affects Mac OS, like many exploits, requires physical access. Unless you are worried about your macbook falling into the hands of the NSA or Russian hackers (note: I'm being hyperbolic), I wouldn't be too worried. I'm pretty concerned about security myself, and I'd have no problem using TrueCrypt. The only concern I would have is future compatibility as operating systems evolve and drop support for older stuff.\nBut there are two active forks off of 7.1a, only one is ready and stable, and has a Mac version: VeraCrypt.\nOnce you set up an encrypted volume - essentially a loopback file - you still have to format it with something cross-platform. I'm guessing you already understand this part, but if not, this is going to be your biggest cross-platform issue. Or at least, it has been for me having done this kind of thing many times.\nFAT32 is really the only rock-solid cross-platform filesystem. It comes with a so-called 32GB partition size restriction, but this can be overcome, for example with Fat32Formatter.\nNTFS \"should\" work, in the form of NTFS-3G, but in practice it never has for me! This could be just my experience, but every time I've tried it I've had issues: either lost data or had concerning enough file integrity issues that it worried me too much to trust important data with. NTFS-3g claims that they comply with NTFS rules better than Microsoft, and that any integrity issues that arise are Microsoft's fault. Which seems plausible to me. But the bottom line is that whenever I used NTFS-3g on a volume, then used it natively in Windows, it had oodles of integrity issues using Microsoft chkdsk. And like I said, I've lost data before, more than once. Personally I just don't trust it.\nBut in the last few years, I've not had to worry about cross-platform issues. Because, if I need to use NTFS from Mac or Linux, I just use it natively in a VM and share it via CIFS. I've even used Windows 2000 (with no licensing issues) in a VM to access NTFS volumes from Mac or Linux.\nBut any more, the only \"cross-platform\" file system I use is ZFS. I used to use two small 1tb USB drives velcro'd to the lid of my Macbook (running Windows), with a Linux VM sharing the ZFS volume via CIFS.\n\nA: Long ago, I used PGP Disk Encryption. I have used it on both Windows and Mac's, but I am not sure that I ever tried to move between two OS's. While Symantec's site says it it compatible with Windows, OS X and Linux, it doesn't directly address moving a drive between OS's.\n", "Q: Hardware issue on iMac, flashing question mark I have an iMac 2008/2009 issue and recently the computer would not boot and I would get a flashing question mark.

This can happen if the disk selected in the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences isn't available. Wait a few seconds to see if your Mac is able to locate the startup disk you specified. \nIf you still see a question mark after waiting a few seconds, use Startup Manager to start up your Mac, then select your startup disk from System Preferences.\nIf a question mark appears after you install a software update, select your startup disk again using macOS Recovery (Power off Mac, then power it on while holding Command+R until you see the Apple logo).\nReference: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204156\n\nA: You need a USB drive with a bootable OS/installer on it to test this...\nThis is probably a long shot but, open the machine and disconnect the SATA cable that connects to your optical drive.  Leave the cable disconnected and attempt to boot up the machine via USB.  If everything works try connecting the SATA cable for the optical drive again and retest.  My theory is the optical drive's SATA cable may be malfunctioning and causing interference on the SATA bus, making it look like a hard drive failure.\nIts worth a try, if it doesn't work please let me know.\n\nA: Understanding the process of events, is sometimes 1/2 of the way to a solution.\n\nWhen you turn on the power to a Mac, it activates the BootROM\n  firmware. \nBootROM,\nwhich is part of the computer’s hardware, has two primary\n  responsibilities: It initializes system hardware and it selects an\n  operating system to run. Two \nBootROM components carry out these functions:\n• Power-On Self Test (POST) initializes some hardware interfaces and\n  verifies that sufficient memory is available and in a good state.\n• Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) does basic hardware\n  initialization and selects which operating system to use.\nIf multiple OS installations are available, BootROM chooses the one\n  that was last selected by the Startup Disk System Preference.

Several times I have been able to pull up a map that I have bookmarked without being connected to the internet. This has been when I was in a vehicle with no cellular,data plan, ect. available. Lately this has not worked. I have location services turned on. Why can I pull up the maps sometimes but not always?\n\nA: Make sure you enable WiFi all the time. Even if you don’t have cellular data or connected to Internet, the device can still estimate your location based on the surrounding WiFi source.\nUpdate: Maps will use the surrounding WiFi (protected or not)  to pinpoint your position. That might explain why it only occasionally works. If your iPad can’t find any WiFi available, then your position can’t be estimated.\n", "Q: Remove menu bar apps from menu bar in OS X What is best method to remove menu bar apps from MacBook Pro Retina running Mavericks?  I've tried Broomstick and a few others with no real easy success.  I've also tried going through System Preferences / User Groups and then Login Items\n\nA: Try Bartender. This lets you hide (as well as re-arrange) menu bar items, as well as providing a secondary menu bar so that you can hide icons from the main bar but still have access to them on a keyboard shortcut or menu bar item.\n\n\nA: I may be misunderstanding, but to remove items from Finder's menu bar is quite simple:\nHold down Command and drag the icon from the menu bar. Poof! It's gone. \nThis works for all Apple based menu bar items, and some third party items. Usually, when it doesn't work for a third party application, there is an option within the app itself to remove its icon from the menu bar.  \n\nA: I found a way to get rid of any icon from the menu bar of macOS Big Sur.\n\n*\n\n*Open the app whose icon you want to get rid-off from the menu bar.\n\n*From the menu bar, near the apple icon > click the name of the app.\n\n*Click on its preferences > Advanced > Scroll down to locate 'System Integration' > Under it, Uncheck the check box for Show Tray Icon.\n\n*Voilà! The icon is gone.\n\n*The steps, almost works for almost every app. [Apps name near Apple Icon on menu bar > Preferences > Look for its Tray icon check box]\n\nBe free to ask if you are unable to remove the icon of any other app.\n\n\n\n\n", "Q: Airport Express network keeps showing up as protected after soft reset I have an aiport express,of which I have forgotten the password.

When I use Find My Phone, its says offline.  \nIs this because it's off or is it possible someone erased my phone? If someone erased my phone, would it still show up as offline, or would it disappear? \nI'm trying to figure out if someone has my phone or if it is just misplaced.\n\nA: Yes, if a device has been restored, Find My iPhone will be deactivated and the device will show as offline. If you have iOS 7 or above, you will receive an email if this occurs next time the device communicates with Apple's servers.\nHowever, with iOS 7 and above, attempting to erase an iPhone with an active Find My iPhone will enable Activation Lock. This means the device will contact Apple's servers and be available to you.

I suspect this has something to do with Screen Sharing trying to present a login screen, and if I'm actually in front of the Air and I'm very quick on the draw, I can quickly re-select the WiFi network and get VNC to connect, but if I'm really \"remote\" I'm in trouble.\nI tried\n$ cd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/\n$ sudo ./airport en0 prefs DisconnectOnLogout=NO\n\nas suggested for a related problem in this answer (adjusted for en0 instead of en1) but to no effect.\nAny other undocumented prefs or other workarounds that might help here? Or do I have to install a third-party VNC server?\n\nA: This happened to me with Yosemite, actually ran into a comment that worked for me here:\nhttp://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mavericks-drops-wifi-when-connecting-in-with-vnc.1694085/\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement VNCAlwaysStartOnConsole -bool true\nAnother option would be to use wired, then it worked for me as well (no setting changes needed).\nFrom https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4170694?start=0&tstart=0 it appears that \"maybe\" the root of the problem is that it's trying to revert to a login screen (and...doesn't do it right? mine definitely did not ever return to a login screen, it just killed the wifi). So perhaps there's a possibility that if you can get your \"wifi\" to remain active in login screens (and/or your mac \"starts\" at the login screen) then you could connect via WiFi and not have it disconnect, and not need the above.  I could not find any way that worked for me to leave my wifi active while logging out, to test this hypothesis, but YMMV.\nAnother hint: when using wifi with \"WPA2 Personal\" and the above set to \"false\" when I connect, it actually works, VNC connects to a \"new remote\" session, not the currently logged in user (i.e. new login screen) (it also allows me to logout and not disconnect the WiFi, something the \"Enterprise\" wifi doesn't allow me to do at all).  So my latest hypothesis is that \"sharing\" stronger encryption connected wifi \"WPA2 enterprise\" isn't allowed somehow (since it's also disallowed in the \"Internet sharing\"), and when it tries to open a new session, which is disallowed over the wifi (\"sharing wifi\" not allowed, for instance, in the sharing pane) it forces a disconnect.  But connecting to the current user is OK.\n", "Q: Pausing Calendar notifications during presentations While giving a talk (PDF file rendered by Preview) from my MacBook, I'd like to make sure that my upcoming appointments do not show up during the talk.\nIs it possible to pause these notifications? How?\nUsing another account on my machine is not an option. I need to be able to give live code demos from my main account.\n\nA: You can enable Do Not Disturb from the top of Notification Center. Open Notification Center using the button on the menu bar or swiping in from the right side of the trackpad with two fingers, then scroll up and turn the switch on.\n\nYou can also ⌥-click on the Notification Center menu bar item to quickly toggle Do Not Disturb.

I'm a long time Mac user but my hesitation is whether the Chrome browser battery drain issue in Mavericks has been addressed either by Google or Apple. I use both Safari and Chrome in my workflow, each have their benefits. \n\nA: Chrome does not consume more energy than the other browsers in this test.\nI just ran a comparison.\nThe set up was to have same amount of demand.\nThree tabs were open, one tab streaming online video in both, Chrome and Firefox (I do not use Safari).\nIn Energy consumption profile below, Chrome was equal to Firefox.\nOf course the Energy consumption is very much dependent on the particular web site.\n\n\nA: Safari actually uses less energy than crime or Firefox but it honestly depends on the website open and number of tabs\n", "Q: Download OS X App Store updates to update multiple Macs I have two MacBook Airs, but I have very limited bandwidth. I would prefer to download updates once and then copy them onto all the other MacBook Airs. How can I download App Store updates once to update multiple Macs?\n\nA: There are two types of update.\nOS X software updates are updates for the OS and OS components (e.g. iTunes). These used to be delivered through a separate software update app, but since the introduction of the Mac App Store, the OS X updates have been combined with Mac App Store updates in the Updates tab of the Mac App Store. However, the CLI tool remains, giving you more flexibility in Terminal and allow the downloading of updates without installing them, perfect for copying to other machines before the installation takes place.\nYou can download OS X updates without installing them (which would automatically remove them) so you can copy them, using the following command:\nsoftwareupdate -dav\n\nThe 10.9.4 update is distributed externally, outside of the Mac App Store; the Mac App Store just provides the UI for the installation process.\nConversely, for Mac App Store apps, you need OS X Server's Caching service, as the apps are 'non-transferrable' and the app receipt must match the Apple ID that downloaded the app for the app to be updated in the future. However, if you're using the same Apple ID, or don't care about updating the app from the second machine, update the app normally then copy the .app bundle from /Applications to the other Macs as necessary.\n\nA: http://support.apple.com/downloads/ has most OS and Security updates. http://www.apple.com/itunes/ always has the latest iTunes version.\nThe format is amenable to downloading once, using many times.\nFor third party stuff, you're pretty much restricted to downloading through the store, but many of those updates can be accomplished on secondary Macs simply by copying the App file from one Mac to the others. This does not always work, but usually will for the simpler Apps.\n", "Q: iTunes plays songs one at a time when stored on external drive I store all my music on an external hard drive. When I click on an album iTunes opens but only plays one track. Is there any way I can play a whole album or multiple albums?\n\nA: Given that you say you're clicking on an album, and iTunes opens, it sounds like you're playing your music from the Finder folder, and not using iTunes itself. If you double-click a song, even if it's within the album's folder, you're just asking for that song.\nOnce iTunes is open, if you double-click and play a song from iTunes, it'll keep playing the whole album, or whole selection of songs that you've chosen.\n", "Q: iMessage doesn't say \"delivered\" or \"not delivered\" I sent an iMessage from my iPod touch to my friends iphone on Monday. It didn't say delivered or not delivered. It was just nothing. His phone is on (I know because my other friends are iMessaging him) and my friend said her messages don't say \"delivered\" at the bottom but they still talk. Mine always say delivered at the bottom. So is this an error, like it didn't go through, or is he just ignoring me? \n\nA: Your friend needs to have turned on iMessage and automatically send a confirmation. \nSettings -> Messages -> iMessage : On\n\nSettings -> Messages -> Send Read Receipts : On\n\nIf they don't have these both on, you will not get a confirmation. \n\nA: Basically, your message has been sent, from your end, to another iPhone or Apple apparatus (it appears in Blue and not Green) but has not been delivered to your recipient.\n\"Delivered\" may not appear for several reasons. The most likely, and also the only I've confirmed, is that the recipient cannot receive the data. This happens when a phone is off or out of service range, obviously. It also happens frequently if they are talking on the phone. When someone is talking voice, and out of a WiFi area, they may not be able to receive text messages, because they may drop or lose some of the data, so it is conveniently held onto for them until they're freed up (i.e. off the phone). It can also happen when WiFi access is spotty, when other apps are running in the background, etc.\nThe reason you may be experiencing this but still receiving responses is that once a response is sent (in any exchange) that \"Delivered\" or \"Read\" message vanishes. Poof. So you're probably just not seeing it change to Delivered to Read before you see a response.\nAnother possibility that makes sense and could explain both, however unconfirmed by yours truly, is that the \"Do Not Disturb\" feature is toggled on the recipients phone. As far as I was aware, this simply prevents them from receiving notifications of the messages, but I haven't test it out.\nIt's one of the above anyway for sure. Hope it helps. \n", "Q: Install Latest OS X version with Internet Recovery This is on a 2012 MacBook Air.\nI just used Disk Utility and erased the SSD, booted into Internet Recovery, connected to the network and let it do its thing.

For last couple of days, I found my browser, running very slowly. As a step of speed it up, in a phase I wanted to delete all my \"Fire fox\" Plug-ins. In that time I found in internet that, the \"Fire fox\" Plug-ins should be stored in the \"Hidden \"Library\" Folder\" of Mac. But I didn't find any thing there. Then I kept searching for the Plug-ins & now I find that, they are stored in the \"Unhidden or regular \"Library\" Folder\". I am going to attach two screen shots so that you can understand the situation. Now My question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why the path is changed?\n\n*Is it necessary to make it correct?\n\n*If though, how could I do it?\n\n\nIf any one familiar with the question please reply me back. Thanks in advance. Have a good day.\nIt should be like this:\n\nBut I found it like this:\n\n\nA: The /Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder contains plugins that can be used by any browser run from any account on your Mac. The /Users/reashedzamil/Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder contains plugins that can be used by any browser but only when it is run by you.\nHowever a better way to check which plugins are actually being used by Firefox is to type about:plugins into the address bar in Firefox. It will list all the plugins loaded into Firefox and tell you where they are. You can also visit http://www.mozilla.org/plugincheck/ which will analyse your browser plugins and tell you which ones are out of date.\nYou will also find another folder called something like /Users/reashedzamil/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/RANDOMTEXT.default/extensions that contains plugins (also known as Extensions or Add-Ons) that will be run within Firefox only when it is run by you. However if you think that extensions are the cause of performance issues, the best way to remove them is to open Tools -> Add-Ons from the menubar and uninstall them from there. \nAnother thing you can use to check for performance problems in Firefox is to type about:healthreport into the address bar.\n\nA: Since your problem is not finding the extensions/plugins/addons files location on your hard drive but the slow Firefox, I would recommend:\nTo Reset Firefox do the following:\nGo to Firefox > Help > Troubleshooting Information.\nClick the \"Reset Firefox\" button.\nFirefox will close and reset.

Click OK. Note you can also see the path of to your library in this pane. \n\n*Next, File > Library > Organize Library... > Consolidate Files. For earlier versions of iTunes, this may be File > Library > Consolidate.\nCopy iTunes Library to an external Hard-drive\n\n\n*\n\n*You can find the location of your iTunes Library from the \"Advanced\" pane mentioned earlier. By default, the location is ~/Music/iTunes/. Find the path from this pane, select it, and copy it using Command+C\n\n*Open Finder. Use the key combination  Shift+Command+G to bring up a \"Go to folder\" window. Paste the copied path here and click ok. \n\n*Drag the folder named \"iTunes\" to the external HDD. Let it copy. Depending on the size of your Library, this could take a bit. Once it has completed, eject the external Hard drive\n\n\nCopy iTunes Library to new computer\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the external hard drive to your new machine. \n\n*Open Finder. Use the key combination  Shift+Command+G again and copy the following path, exactly as shown, into the pop-up window: ~/Music/\n\n*You will see an iTunes Folder present. Drag it into your trash. \n\n*Next, open the external drive, and drag the iTunes folder from the external drive to the same (now empty) Music folder on the new machine. \n\n*Open iTunes. Your original library, including the metadata (playlists, etc), should now be present on the new machine. \n\n\nA: You can just locate the relevant iTunes library and copy to the new. I have used this to copy from a PC when I first got a Mac.\nI wouldn't actually do this, as there are many better ways to do so. My first choice would be Migration Assistant but you could use the iTunes Backup and Restore from Backup\n\nA: iTunes should always be backwards compatible with earlier libraries, so you can just copy the library over to the new machine, and open it up. Drag and drop over wireless, or ethernet, will work just fine.\nTwo key things here:\n1) You can have your iTunes folder anywhere, but the default location is iTunes inside your home directory, inside a folder called Music. If you copy it from your old computer to the new, into the same location iTunes should find and use it without any issues.\n2) When  you start iTunes it'll create a new iTunes library, if it doesn't find one. Hold down option when you start iTunes and it'll prompt you to locate and use a library that already exists. You can do this to point it to your existing iTunes library copied over from your old laptop, if you want to store it in a non-standard location.\nAlso:\n3) iTunes will upgrade your library for the latest iTunes version. Once you do this you won't be able to go back, if you ever want to copy it back to the old laptop.

I'm on the latest MacOS X (10.9.4).\n\nI just ordered the Seiki SE50UY04 which is a 50\" 4K @ 30Hz display.\nHow can I run that display off my laptop, preferably right off the HDMI port on the laptop?\n\nA: Ok, so I got the display and it works just fine - power it up and connect the HDMI cable and it's set to 4K @ 30Hz (the panel's limit).\nSometimes when coming out of sleep, the HDMI panel keeps cycling through a black screen, displays \"snow\" or digital white noise. Sometimes it goes for 5 or more minutes! It's a weird bug and I know that opening the macbook pro lid helps it get quickly out of this weird mode. I think this might be a Mac OS X bug.\nOn a side note, at the native 4K resolution, everything looks the right size on the screen at 3' away but the panel is a bit too big. I have to move my head quite a bit - like when talking to 2-3 people at a party and you have to move your head to make eye contact ... maybe should have ordered the 39\" display...\nUPDATE\nSo I also bought a VIZIO 50\" 4K display (\"P502ui-B1E\") and a new Macbook Pro 15\" Retina Mid 2014 (GeForce 750M)\nThe VIZIO has an HDMI 2.0 port so can do 4K @ 60Hz but I noticed that Mac OS X (10.10.2) can still only do 4K@30Hz over it's in-built HDMI port while the same machine, when booted into Windows 8.1 (Bootcamp) can do 4K@60Hz very easily.\n\nA: See the official Apple page for details, but the bottom line is:\n\n\n*\n\n*HDMI ports can do 30 Hz or below, on all MBPR models.\n\n*Thunderbolt ports can do 60 Hz, but with only one monitor at a time, and only if you have a discrete GPU, and only on 2013 models and up.\n\n\nA: There is no Mid-2013 Macbook Pro. If you have an early 2013 model, you can't run the 4k display due to hardware limitations. If you have the late 2013 model, you can indeed. By default, it runs at 30 Hz. If you enable Multi-Stream Transport on the external display, you can run it at 60 Hz via the Thunderbolt 2 port (equipped with DP 1.2 technology). \n\nA: I purchased a Dell P2815Q 4K Monitor from the Microsoft site $299.00.

Let's say a man named San Zhang (张三), a citizen of China. He may be living in China or The US. He has a English name \"John Smith\", which he wants to use as the \"seller name\" of his apps on App Store.\nHowever, when he tried signing up Apple Developer Program, he was told that the \"seller name\" will be same to the name on credit card, which will be used to pay for the program fee and receive payment for apps he sold.\nNow, the problem is:\n\n\n*\n\n*China government doesn't let him use John Smith as legal name.\n\n*China government doesn't allow him to use a name different from 张三 when opening a bank account.\n\n*The US government doesn't allow him to use a name different from San Zhang when opening a bank account. (Not sure this one)\n\n*He cannot migrate to the US before the planned release date of his first Mac/iOS app. Or he doesn't want to become a citizen of a country where he is allowed to use John Smith as legal name.\n\n\nIn such a case, could he use John Smith as \"seller name\" of his apps on App Store? Or he has to open a company to sell apps? (In other words, could he achieve this goal, which seems not being allowed/expected/supposed by Apple?)\nAnother case is, could a US citizen use another name than his legal name as \"seller name\" on App Store?\nThank you very much.\n\nA: Simply use your Chinese name. Why would you like to use your English name?\n\nA: Apple has a support phone number as well as email to assist with developer account creation. I would suggest you simply obey the rules that Apple has established for their account creation as best you can and then contact the developer support team if you are prevented from signing up or want to ensure you will be paid properly once the release date draws near.\nYou may also want to get legal advice in the country which your Apple ID is based when you register it. You probably won't need it for something as simple as translation of names, but part of your question seems to imply legal concerns and getting that sort of advice from the internet would be a waste of your time since Lawyers don't give advice over the internet in general due to professional obligations to ensure they actually represent a specific client properly.\n", "Q: DMG or Package Installer If I need to download an App, what method of installer should I prefer DMG or Package Installer? Which has greater advantage.\n\nA: DMG is easy drag and drop install for softwares that don't require specific installations;\nPackage Installer is for softwares who need to have specific parts installed in a specific place (libraries, plug-ins...)\nI would prefer the first one, because you can make easy and clean (un)installation with 1 mouse's click.\n", "Q: How to edit iOS system file on my iPad over SSH? I have an iPad with iOS 7.1.1. I jailbroke it and was able to ssh it from wifi without a problem.\nLately I wanted to edit some system files to tweak few settings but I realized that there is no vi (or any other file editor) in the file system. Is there anyway I can install 'ios version of vi' or any other file editor?\nI don't want to install independent app for it (such as iFile)—I need an editor which works in shell.\n\nA: You can install nano or vi from Saurik's repo.\n", "Q: Is it safe to restore the ~/Library folder? I have just replaced my magnetic hard drive with a new and fast SSD drive. \nI have placed the old drive in an external case, so all the files are available, and all the data was successfully restored.\n\nMy dilemma is about the ~/Library folder. It contains a lot of application settings which can save lots of time reconfiguring. \nIs it safe to restore the contents of the ~/Library folder to the new SSD drive?\nUpdate: I have not used time machine, just placed the old hard drive in a case and connected it via USB.\n\nA: I always did that -- in fact, if you did NOT upgrade OS version I'd just copy the folder wholesale.  Restoring from a Time Machine backup would do something similar, and equally dumb -- I had problems with Mail once because time machine had passed a preference file across between OS versions, and the pref file conflicted with the new Mail [1], so Time Machine is no guarantee that all will be smooth.\nSo, if you are NOT also upgrading OS, just copy all across.  If you are also upgrading OS move the data in ~/Library (such as your emails), and the prefs for stuff that is not bundled with the OS (such as Mail or Safari), but I'd reset the preferences for those applications only once more from within the apps themselves.\n[1] What is com.apple.mail.plist and why was it slowing Mail down?\n", "Q: Is there an actually secure VNC iOS app for use with OS X Screen Sharing? All iOS VNC clients I have tried use regular VNC authentication. This is insecure because of the 8 character limit on the password, and so on. Some apps such as RealVNC's VNC Viewer, does have info panels that report whether the connection is encrypted, and it never says that it is, even when I turn both checkboxes in the System Preferences under Screen Sharing's Computer Settings... off. \nSo, I am definitely taking the accepted answer to this question with a grain of salt. \nIt seems that the only way to go about this is to switch OS X's native Screen Sharing option off entirely, and then use some other method to host VNC securely. This is not a free option, though. \n\nA: The answer to that question is correct, but there are some nuances.\nScreen Sharing server supports 4 authentication types:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OS X user login / password\n\n*Apple ID\n\n*Request for observe / control (\"Anyone may request permission to control screen\")\n\n*VNC password (\"VNC viewers may control screen with password\")\n\n\nWhenever the built-in Screen Sharing client (Cmd+K in Finder) connects to a Screen Sharing server, it uses only types 1, 2 and 3. Then server enables traffic encryption that may work in one of two modes: full encryption or keystroke/mouse move encryption. You could select encryption mode in earlier versions of Mac OS X, but in 10.8 (AFAIR) they removed this option, so Screen Sharing connection is always fully encrypted.\nAFAIK there are only two third-party iOS clients that support Screen Sharing authentication types: Screens and Remotix. Both can use authentication types 1 and 3 with keystroke/mouse move encryption, but it seems that full encryption is provided only by Remotix.\nNote that if a client uses VNC password (type 4) to connect to Screen Sharing server, then encryption is disabled at all.\n\nA: MochaVNC lite uses Mac OS X user login / password. \nI've been using it forever and don't even remember how long ago they added Mac OS credential authentication. Unlike most other apps that support this feature you do not need the paid version.  I use it sporadically mainly to perform software updates to a headless mac mini that is my home server and iTunes video library server.\nSince I only use it locally I didn't really look into the security features it has. It is a free solution with a paid $6 version but I really haven't looked into the paid differences since the free solution works with screen sharing for me. As a side note, my mac mini works much better now that I bought a HDMI video dongle. It used to be very sluggish even though its on ethernet, turns out a headless mac mini doesn't use the video card unless there is a monitor (dongle) plugged in.\n", "Q: Safari appending .EXE to the end of .PDF I have had reported on occasions when Safari on Mac is downloading a PDF from one of our sites it will append .EXE to the end of the file. The MIME type is correctly set to be pdf but it still does it occasionally.\nI have found http://support.apple.com/kb/TA24293 which seems to indicate that this is a known issue with Safari on Mac however as official as this is (Since it is from Apple themselves) our clients don't seem to want to believe it. So I want to know if there is a solution to this problem?\nI say \"occasionally\" because we have some Macs that this is happening on and some it's not. So maybe it's a setting or something, it downloads perfectly fine in IE, Firefox, Chrome and even downloads fine on mobile Safari. It is just Mac Safari.\n\nA: Just a blind guess:\nOn the Macs with the issue, install RCDefaultApp, and use it to check if the settings for the mime type and .pdf extension are correct. Could be that they're linked to a Windows VM, for instance.\n\nA: HTTP Header: Content-Disposition\nHave the server include an additional Content-Disposition header when serving the PDFs:\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"<MyPDF.pdf>\"\n\nThis provides the browser with a strong suggestion for the desired filename and suffix. See How to encode the filename parameter of Content-Disposition header in HTTP? for a discussion about limitations and implementing this feature.\nMIME Type\nAdditionally, make sure the server's PDF mime type in the Content-Type: header is set correctly. There are variations in use. application/pdf is the recommended type.\n\nThe standard MIME type is application/pdf. The assignment is defined in RFC 3778, The application/pdf Media Type, referenced from the MIME Media Types registry.\n\nTest with curl\nUse curl -I http://example.com/mypdf.pdf to test and ensure the correct headers are returned by your server. curl can provide credentials to work as a logged in user.\nPotentially related question: When sending headers to download a PDF, Safari appends .html\n\nA: Download the file, then double click on it and choose Open With. Under this menu, select any app capable of opening PDFs like Adobe Reader and the file will open.\n", "Q: Running OS X Server on main machine I'm considering installing the OS X Server app on my main, day-to-day machine, in order to run Xcode Server and get a GUI for the VPN configuration (I'm already using the VPN with a manually configured LaunchDaemon).\nAre there any reasons I shouldn't do this (such as security or performance issues)? I don't have another Mac that can run Mavericks at the moment, and would turn off all of the services I won't be using.\n\nA: Generally, installing OS X Server on a main machine is not recommended, but if you have no choice, it should still be fine. There are some things to note, of course…\nPostgreSQL has a massive impact on boot up times and shutdown times. PostgreSQL is used by many of the services in OS X Server and has meant that my iMac now takes well over 3 minutes to shut down. However, overall performance in the system is generally unaffected, providing you don't enable all the services or be running computationally-intensive tasks. For example, it might seem obvious, but running a build with an Xcode server CI bot will kill performance as it uses all the CPU available, leaving none for the current user. This is opposite to many services in OS X which will limit CPU usage to leave enough for a good user experience.\nWith regard to security, providing you are aware of what you are enabling, you shouldn't have any problem with this. The largest thing to note is that OS X Server will, by default, enable SSH access, which you may wish to disable. Everything else is by default disabled.\n\nA: If your main machine is a laptop, do NOT run Server on it.\nI tried this once, and was rather taken aback by the amount of time it spent with the fans on full. The battery life was cut by at least 50%, too.\nMost of this is down to such abominations as PostgreSQL, which seems to love the CPU and makes as much use of it as possible.\nI have since installed it on my Mac Mini at home, and it too spends its time with the fan running more than it used to. However, it has less of an impact on a machine that is always connected to a power outlet.\nOne problem I have found with the OS X Server app is that after it has been updated a few times, it needs deleting and reinstalling again, to make PostgreSQL work at all. Without doing this, it just sits filling the log with messages about PostgreSQL not being started, and has a Python process eating CPU all the time (presumably looking for PostgreSQL?). The remedy is fairly simple - delete the Server app and wait for it to notice and tell you. Then install it afresh, and it's OK again. For a while.\nHaving said all this, once it's set up and working, the Caching service, the Time Machine service, the VPN service and the Xcode service with its Git server - are all wonderful.\n\nA: I've been running OSX Server on my main desktop since 2009 (10.6 and 10.8 server). After initial setup has calmed down there are no noticeable performance issues, Chrome consumes most of the CPU time.\nI would not run Server on a laptop, and I prefer to run development machines with spinning drives.\nOne warning though - if you do hose the system there is no 'reset' function. Deleting Server,app, deleting .ServerSetupDone do NOT clear things like OpenDirectory out. A full wipe is required, but if you are sensible and put user data on a different partition it's fairly quick.\n", "Q: What 4K modes does MacBook Pro (Late 2011, Radeon HD6750M) support? I have a MacBook Pro Late 2011, and I'm planning to buy a 4K monitor (http://www.samsung.com/levant/consumer/computers-peripherals/monitors/led-monitor/LU28D590DS/ZN).\nHowever, all the Internet is bloated about 4K support with different answers about 4K support on MBPs. Some say it's not possible, some say only at 30 or 24Hz, some say with multistream etc.\nWhat can I exactly get with late 2011 MacBook Pro (Mavericks 10.9.4) in terms of 4K?\n\nA: I have a Dell P2815Q monitor (nearly 4K) connected to my MacBookPro Early 2011 running 10.9.4 (13E28)\n\n\n\nA: From the official source\nGraphics and video support\n\nAMD Radeon HD 6750M graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR5 memory on\n  2.2GHz configuration; or AMD Radeon HD 6770M graphics processor with 1GB of GDDR5 memory on 2.4GHz configuration.\nDual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native\n  resolution on the built-in display and up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on an\n  external display, both at millions of colors.\n\nSorry, you will not get 4k resolution due to the Graphics card you have.\n", "Q: Is there a way to make an iPhone 5S read an SD micro card? I have an old point-and-shoot Lumix DMC-FP8 that I would like to be able to directly connect to my iPhone 5S for editing purposes. I bought a camera USB to lightening connector, but the camera is not supported. I tried putting the SD micro card into an adapter and plugging that into my phone, but it says that the device requires too much power. Do I have any options?\n\nA: I purchased an eye-fi SD card and it works perfectly...once you download the app and connect via wifi to the card, the images transfer right over, where they can be edited just like all the photos taken from the iphone.\n\nA: The camera connection kit is only for iPad. There is unfortunately no way to connect a camera or SD card to an iPhone/iPod Touch.\n\nA: Direct connections like that don't work AFAIK.  I believe you'll have to use an intermediate step, such as a laptop, to transfer the file.\n", "Q: Does anyone know of an alternative to CPULED that is not connected to the AppStore? Just want something similar (UI/ease of use) that is a freeware. :)\nI can make a copy of the app that is installed in Applications but when I install it in another Mac, it wants me to login to the AppStore. Just want to avoid that extra step. It's not a big hassle but still I wanna avoid it if an alternative exists.\nThanks a lot :)\n\nA: MenuMeters is a free alternative that is not associated with the Mac App Store.\nThis program gives much more information than CPU LED does, but it is configurable, so you can decide to hide the information that is not relevant to you.\niStat Menus is another alternative which is similar to MenuMeters, but is supposedly better (based on comments from multiple sources). However it is no longer free as of version 3. Version 2 is now outdated and might not work properly on a newer OS.\nPlease note that I am not in any way affiliated with the two programs above and have not used either program extensively.\n", "Q: Private Key and Certificate protection on IOS I have a question about private key protection on iOS.\nI simply would like to know if there is a way of protecting client's certificates when importing them to an iPad.\nFor example, when installing a certificate on an Android device, it forces me to set a pin or pass phrase to the device, which can't be disabled until the certificate is deleted.\nIs there something like that in iOS?\nEdit: In my case, I'm speaking of private devices used for professional activity. It means that we can't applied any MDM policy solution (because we don't own the device).\nAm I right?\n\nA: Yes, iOS has MDM functionality built in to it to enforce enrollment into a policy framework where the device has to obey profile restrictions.\nPassphrase restrictions was one of the first things to be deployed - perhaps around iOS 4.\nYou can use Apple's Server.app to set up these profiles as well as Apple Configurator and many third party MDM solutions can help you configure the OS to secure and introduce certificates and public/private key chains of trust.\nApple documents this at a high level at http://www.apple.com/iphone/business/it/management.html and once you have read up on how configuration profiles work, feel free to ask another more narrow question if you run into any difficulties.\n", "Q: repair an out-of-warranty Thunderbolt port The Thunderbolt port on my trusty several-year-old MacBook Pro is failing. To connect an external display, I now have to wiggle the cable around, then pull it out a few millimeters until the contacts are lined up just right. It's only a matter of time before the port breaks entirely.\nEverything else about the machine is in great shape. Is this a \"replace the entire motherboard\" problem, or is there a better/faster/cheaper solution?\n\nA: For that Mac, the thunderbolt port is a part of the motherboard (on the left, 3rd from the top): \nSo unless you're able to source the parts, perform a package exchange that clearly is a machine solder and then test things, the most economical repair would be to exchange the whole motherboard. As long as there is no physical damage inside, this would be a flat rate repair ($280) for Apple and probably cheaper than buying a logic board used. The flat rate repair would fix anything else wrong with the Mac. But, if you're up to reflow that part and do advanced soldering - there are lots of people that can attempt this repair even though it's not a trivial one.\n\nA: While I'm sure it IS possible to just replace the thunderbolt port it would be labor intensive and a specialized procedure. \nSo yes, this is a replace the entire logic board procedure.\nApple DOES offer a flat rate repair service for out of warranty Macs though.  They talk about it a little bit in their KB article - AppleCare Direct Mail-In Repair Serivce. You can get a free quote from Apple on the repair at https://support.apple.com/mac-notebooks/repair/service and it will likely be in the $300 range for parts, labor, shipping.\nBasically they offer a flat rate repair.  Assuming your Mac is damage free (no major dents, liquid damage, etc) they will mail it to their repair depot where the issues will be addressed and parts will be replaced for a flat fee.  The fee varies between models/sizes but will more than likely be less than the cost of having the logic board replaced by itself at an Apple store or AASP.\nIf you don't like the web service option, you can also arrange this by calling AppleCare (1-800-APLCARE) or visiting the Genius Bar at an Apple store or AASP.  You can find nearby Apple stores and AASPs using Apple's handy locate tool, just search for Service in your area.\n\nA: If you can find the exact replacement part, then an electronic technician can replace it for you. Finding the exact component isn't trivial, though. Having Apple repair it is likely your best bet.  Next best would be replacing the motherboard.\nIn the meantime, you can find decent USB video adaptors for the mac that should meet your needs for less than the cost of a repair, and none of the wait for the repair.  Don't expect to play 3D games on such an adaptor, but everything else should be nearly as good as the thunderbolt connected display.\n\nA: I use a USB port for my monitor (dual monitor setup) , no problems at all.  \nBesides, I have upgraded to an SSD drive (Samsung) and 16 GB RAM (komputerbay). All have worked flawlessly since day 1. I use a MacBook Pro 2013 15\".\n\nA: From this comment:\n\nTo connect an external display, I now have to wiggle the cable around,\nthen pull it out a few millimeters until the contacts are lined up\njust right.\n\nA physical port repair/replacement can be done at a reasonable cost; most of the time at a price far less expensive than a logic board replacement.  In fact the price for the component is extremely inexpensive (USB-C PCB Surface Mount Connector).  What you will be paying for is the labor - typically $100 to $200 on eBay\nWhile this is something that can be done at home, I must stress this is not a typical DIY type procedure.  You need some rework skills.\nThe picture below shows a typical USB connector with a damaged solder pad, this is an easy fix and all that needs to be done is to resolder this connection.  This assumes of course that the connector itself is still good that the solder joint is faulty.\n\nIf the connector itself is bad (they are physical devices and are subject to wear and tear) it's not overly difficult to replace this.  It invloves removing the old connector and replacing it with a new connector\n\nTL;DR\nCan this be done?  Absolutely?\nIs it DIY?  If you have the soldering skills.\nDo you need a new logic board?  No, you can have it done\nIs it expensive?  No.  The component is super cheap and the labor is quite reasonable compared to a new logic board.\n\nA: You can also try bypassing that port entirely and just use a USB port with an adapter like \"Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0/2.0 to HDMI/DVI Adapter for Windows and Mac up to 2560x1440 in White\" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MS0DIK/\n", "Q: Is it safe to use the mac's cable for an airport express? When you pull the power plug off the airport express, a connector appears, similar to the connector on the mac's power brick. These connect perfectly, but I want to be sure: is it safe to use a mac's cable to power an airport express?\n\nA: I often use the smaller Airport cable to power the Mac power adapter without having a ground and you can safely do the opposite as long as you get a firm connection and support the AirPort hardware if the plug extends lower than the bottom of the device.\n", "Q: Usb drive is constantly active: why? I recently bought a large USB drive and stored about 300GB of new data on it.1 I haven't changed anything on the drive, and I'm not reading any files right now. But the drive is active -- I hear the read/write heads flicking back and forth like mad. What on earth is OS X doing?\nI assume it has something to do with metadata. But it would be great to have a sense of what kind of metadata is being generated, and whether I can stop it (or would want to). I can see the amount of disk space used slowly creeping up!\n1. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but the data consists of page scans and OCRed text from about 350,000 books from HathiTrust, stored mostly in zip files.\n\nA: It's probably Spotlight indexing the drive, which is going to include full-text indices of those PDF scans if they've been OCR'd.\nIf you want detail--to see the status of the indexing, for example, there is a handy chart at http://commandlinemac.blogspot.com/2008/12/spotlight-on-command-line.html\n\nA: Open your Activity monitor in the Utility folder and look for\n\nmds_stores\n\nCPU and CPU time values.\nThe CPU should be <0.5% and time depends but about a hour.\nIf you have higher CPU % values then your spotlight is active.\nIf not, then you have something on the drive needing updates, or synchronization, or back up.\nFor that look who is active, and for how long.

How do I fix this So I tried the thing in the settings when you go to iTunes and App Store then go to payment info and click none. But for my iphone5 there is no none on the payment info. HELPPPPP\n\nA: I've had this happen to me multiple times(on different accounts that is), and although I don't really remember precisely what I did, there was an option to proceed without putting in any credit card details, and if I remember correctly, it was even set as the default option. I am unable to replicate this again, so I can't really say for sure now, but you don't really have to put in any further details, just look for the option that says something like \"None\" or something along those lines and click next. That should do it for you and then Apple won't bug you asking for payment details again, or at least its only ever happened once for me.\n", "Q: How to drag icon in Preview to a folder and copy instead of aliasing? After downloading a PDF, Preview automatically opens and I'm able to look at the file. Often times I want to move the file to somewhere other than Downloads.\nIn Mavericks I'm able to click on the title and choose a new location in the drop down under the Where: item as shown in the screenshot. \nIf I already have a Finder window open to the folder where I want to move the file it would be faster to just drag the icon from the title bar to the Finder. However, the default behavior is to create an alias. I've tried using modifier keys to make this a copy operation instead of an alias but without success. \nIs there a trick to make this work or should I be submitting an enhancement request to Apple?\n\nA: Hold down the alt (option) key before dropping the icon in the Finder. That copies it for me, and that's been standard behavior in the Finder forever.\n\nA: Don't drag the small icon in the window titlebar, drag the miniature icon of the image on the sidebar instead (if you don't see the miniatures, select it from the \"view\" menu or press cmd+alt+2). Be aware that this won't move but copy the file. \nThe greatest advantage of this is that with miniatures, you can drag single pages out of PDF files (or even join PDFs at specific pages if you drag the other way around).\n", "Q: Unable to Turbo boost Macbook Pro I have MBP 13\" 2012, my cpu 2.5 Ghz up to 3.1 Ghz but when I use Intel Gadget, the cpu only reach 2.9 Ghz on render and heavy use situation. Is it possible to make cpu reach 3.1 Ghz by terminal command or by an application ?\n\nA: 3,1GHz is a single core maximum. Like when running prime95 on one core. \nhttp://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html\nIntel has a sneaky way of suggesting that it will work on all cores under some conditions but that's just advertising unfortunately. \n\nA: There are some more factors playing in the Intel Turbo Boost Game.\nNew Processors like the i3 i5 i7 Generations from Intel als intelligent.\nSo here are some parameters CPU's are evaluating before going to maniac mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU Core Temperatur\n\n*Power Status\n\n*Mainboard Temeratur\n\n*how many cores are used\n\n*and much more\n\n\nSo it isn't easy to explain all of the things but if the CPU Temp is over an certain level - Intel CPU is downclocking - so you won't reach the 3,1GHz - and if you are using Battery Power the System does not allow the energy intensive obove 2,8Ghz.\nAlso the Turbo Mode is acitvated if only one core need \"extrem\" CPU Power, because the Heat has to be transfered from the CPU out of the Macbook.

The company I work for is developing an app that uses geolocation and drains battery very quickly which is obviously a problem.\nThe customers will have both iPhone 4 and 5s so it would be great if such an external battery exists\n\nA: Yes.  Most external batteries that are USB can be hooked up to both the 4S's 30-pin port and 5s's lightning port.

This usually happens when the power management extensions aren't loaded in the operating system, and issues with sleep are one of the biggest indicator of this. \nHave a look at this page : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro.

I know that selling things without going through App Store In-App Purchases etc. is not allowed widely. Even apps like Dropbox historically had problems with it and even they use in-app purchases for Dropbox upgrades today.\nIf I'd develop an app that people donate charities using an online payment system (like Balanced or Stripe), would Apple still take my app down because I'm not going through in-app puchases?\n\nA: I have here some App Store Review Guidelines, but you can't use in-app for donations. There are some points in the Apple In-App Purchase Policy covering some of your questions:\n\n21. Charities and contributions\n21.1 Apps that include the ability to make donations to recognized charitable organizations must be free\n21.2 The collection of donations must be done via a web site in Safari or an SMS\n\nSource:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html (late 2013)\n\nA: I don't believe that limitation effects Apple Pay transactions, since it's not going through Apple's in-app purchase program. It also wouldn't be subject to Apple's 30% cut. Apple would get a portion of the transaction, but in the form of a fee charged to your credit processing merchant for the service of generating the secure Apple Pay transaction tokens.\n\nA: The main problem with using Apple payment frameworks for donations is that Apple doesn't share user information. Non-profits need user information like name and address for tax purposes.

I used the Cell formatting inspector to declare the cell as Date & Time, 1/5/14, 7:08 PM. I entered text-insertion mode on the cell, and selected Insert > Date & Time.  It inserted Friday, July 4, 2014 (and no time). When I then selected the cell (you know, one click, which outlines the cell, as opposed to two clicks which puts you into text insertion mode), the inspector said the cell's format had reverted to Automatic. I switched it back to Date & Time but now it reads 7/4/14 12:00 (it's really more like 1:50).\nThe whole thing is anti-intuitive and zany to me. Can someone tell me what's the right way to command Numbers to insert the current date and time into a cell, and then leave it?  (=NOW continues to update)\nUPDATE 1\nThe three methods I've tried for entering the current date and time into a cell are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter text-insertion mode in a cell, Insert > Date & Time (which enters just the Date, as Friday, July 4, 2014), enter cell-selection mode on the cell, and change the format to Date & Time (which changes it to Friday, July 4, 2014 12:00 AM).  So, not that one.\n\n*Enter text-insertion mode in a cell, type =NOW (which enters 7/4/14 1:31 PM and changes all other instances of cells with =NOW to 7/4/14 1:31 PM !!).  So, definitely not that one.\n\n*Enter text-insertion mode in a cell, type 7/4/14 1:34 pm which gets changed to 7/4/14 1:34 PM (i.e. 'pm' got capitalized), indicating that Numbers did recognize it as a date/time.  This works. But it's less than satisfactory, to put it mildly.\n\n\nI can't imagine this is working as Apple intended.\n\nA: I believe Insert > Date & Time (and its two companions) are intended for use in headers and footers. These are available after choosing File > Print. When used there, the inserted date can be clicked for a little popup formatter and button to manually reset the time to now.\nThe feature you want, an auto-generated NOW cell that does not change, is apparently not available. \nOption A: Put the NOW function into a cell somewhere.  It shows the current time. Copy the cell, then Edit > Paste Formula Results into the cell you want to have the unchanging time.\nOption B: Use a general macro app (like the amazingly capable Keyboard Maestro) to generate your date/time text and paste it into a cell.\nIn both cases, choose the date and time formats you want on the final cell.\n(Numbers 3.5.3 used for this answer)\n\nA: Taken from this post by Andy Taylor\nApple Script snippet\ndo shell script \"date +%Y-%m-%d\\\\ %H:%M\\\\\n\nOpen Automator.app\nCreate a new Service\nSet it to receive selected text in any application\nCheck the ‘Output replaces selected text’ tick-box\nInsert the ‘Run AppleScript’ action\nCopy and paste the above AppleScript\nPress run to make sure it works\nSave the .workflow file to ~/Library/Services\nOpen the Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts system preference pane, select Services in the left column, then find the Service you just created.\nAssign a keyboard shortcut. I use Command + Option + d\n\nAs Andy notes, the requirement is that this text replaces selected text. So in Numbers.app select some text, trigger your script via hotkey, and the text will be replaced.\nPlease note that you will have to restart Numbers.app to get this to work if you have it open while creating your Automator / Applescript / Keyboard-shortcut work.\n\nA: Insert the Date & time into your a cell in your spreadsheet. Immediately cut that cell's contents (Cmd-X) then Paste Formula Results (Cmd-Shift-V). This pastes the contents as static text, formatted as you've formatted the cell: the value will not change, even after re-opening the spreadsheet. Note that you can still change the cell formatting after pasting -- it will use the original value that you pasted, so you can \"add\" hours, minutes, and seconds after the fact.\n\nA: it should work if you first enter the content  (in your case =NOW) and then format the cell.\nif you enter a formula as content it goes per default always to automatic.\nIf you wana now why? - It's because this. Thinking from the View of a Developer what would happen if a user adds in a formula witch generates text and not a date/time but has before assinged a Dateformate to the cell -> the Whole Application would crash so -> no go -> needs to have an other solution -> so what else maybe detect that it won't work and ask the User to change to a possible format -> what when the user sometimes does it correct (also show the Format choose dialog or not also what if he knows what hes doing, and don't want to see any dialog) -> result Dialog message is not a good solution so what else maybe doing a switch to automatic always -> its always the same so users get used to it and it works although a user doesn't know what hes doing. Only down point users have to get used to it to first enter data and then formating it. But wait shouldn't they even been used to it caused by Text/Letter Writing Applications . YES its really the same there first enter content/text then formatting it.\nSo i hope now it is clear why you have to first enter the formula and then second change the formate of the cell.\n\nA: I'm assuming this refers to excel.\nin formula bar type =now() then press  F9 (while cursor is still in the formula bar). Cell should now contain current date and time.\n\nA: Try entering function as = DAY(NOW())&\"/\"&MONTH(NOW())&\"/\"&YEAR(NOW())\n", "Q: Macbook Cursor does not show My daughter's Macbook Air does not show a Cursor, although ⌘+Tab shows it.\nHow do I force it to display normally?\n\nA: Try following troubleshooting steps:\n1 - Start in Safe mode (reboot, hold shift right after the startup chime)\nif cursor shows then it is a 3party software\n2 - Log in as other user (Guest)\nif cursor shows it is your (daughters) user profile that needs fixing\nIf none of above worked, it is your Trackpad app that needs fixing.\n", "Q: Streaming with Videos app fills Other memory Recently I bought a film in iTunes and streamed it using the Videos app. Afterwards I found that my 'Other' memory usage had jumped massively (to the point I couldn't watch or download anything else).\nI do know that when I download films and then manually erase them the memory is reclaimed.\nEventually I had to back up the iPad, erase and restore it. This is a very drastic fix every time I watch a film!

Then if I use my iPad, the tabs list is replaced with my iPad's tabs.\n\n*On either iOS device, I can only see the Mac.\nSo far I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*rebooting\n\n*signing in and out of iCloud\n\n*changing the names of the devices\n\n*restoring the devices from backups\n\n\nHas anyone else encountered this problem?\n\nA: This is caused by setting up your iPad from your iPhone’s backup.\nIn macOS, the file ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.Safari.*.plist holds a key named SyncedTabsDeviceUUID. The value of that string uniquely identifies your browser’s synced iCloud Tabs.\nSince I have Safari Technology Preview installed, I have a second file ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.SafariTechnologyPreview.*.plist, with a different SyncedTabsDeviceUUID allowing both Safari and Safari Technology Preview to sync their tabs independently via iCloud.\nWhen you restore a device from backup, that SyncedTabsDeviceUUID gets restored as well, leading to collisions during iCloud Tabs syncing.\nIf you want to get fancy, you could try backing up your iPad to iTunes, find and edit that file within your iOS backup, then restore it back to your iPad.\nOr you could just setup your iPad as new and get a legitimate unique ID for it.\n\nA: I have been experiencing the same issue for the last year. My only thought is that it has something to do with initializing my iPad from a backup of my iPhone. Perhaps there is some type of device identifier that carried across, which could make the two devices overwrite each other's iCloud Tabs settings? But I think this is unlikely, because everything else iCloud-related is working. \nStill, I would recommend wiping your iPad, and initializing it as a new device, without restoring from a backup. So crazy, it just might work!\n\nA: I had the same problem with my iPad Mini. I used an iPhone backup when initialising it. Just reset the iPad Mini and now both iPhone and iPad webpages show together on my MacBook. Each iOS device have the others webpages with MacBook.\n\nA: Your best bet is that iCloud can only show one device at a time. What you could try to do, however, is link the two iOS devices together via Bluetooth. That might sync the tabs between the two and list both of their tabs. If not, than iCloud is a one-at-a-time thing.\n", "Q: Backup Mac and IOS devices locally I have a friend who lives where there isn't very fast Internet connectivity. He has a Mac Book, an iPad, and some iPhones. He has a decent WiFi hotspot. He wants to back up everything, possibly to a disk drive also connected to his home router - either WiFi or wired. He would also like to be able to restore things, should the need arise. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Connect the device to iTunes (over Wi-Fi or USB), then select to backup the device. This will backup the contents of the device to ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/ which can be copied to an external drive. To restore from backup, copy the folder back and restore from this backup.\n\nA: With so many devices to back up you should consider the \nAirPort Time Capsule.\nWith AirPort Time Capsule, you get a superfast Wi‑Fi base station and an easy-to-use backup device all in one. \nAnd backing up your data couldn’t be simpler. Just set it up once and AirPort Time Capsule does the rest.\n\n\n*\n\n*The iPhone and iPad back up to iTunes on your Mac. \n\n*Then, when your Mac backs up to the Time Capsule, the iOS backups are copied over as well.\n\n*The iPhone and iPad cannot backup directly to the Time Capsule. \nSee this Apple Support document for more details on backups.\n", "Q: Can't activate iPhone 4S I recently purchased an iPhone 4S from Craigslist that had been reset when I bought it.  When I try to activate the phone with the Apple ID that the previous owner gave me I receive an error saying that the account provided couldn't be used to unlock the device.\nI know that it needs to be associated with the correct account but how do I even tell what account the phone was activated with originally?\nThe only thing I can see on the activate phone screen is the following:\n\nThis iPhoneis currently linked to an Apple ID (xxxxx@gmail.com).  Sign in with the Apple ID that was used to set up this iPhone.\n\nIs there a way to show or reveal the Apple ID that is associated with the account?  At the very least I want to contact the original owner to see if it was stolen from them but I can't even do that.  Very frustrating.\n\nA: As a rule of thumb, you should always prevent buying iDevices(iPod, iPhone, and iPad) from Craigslist and eBay, no matter how attractive they look. Even if you had went through eBay, you couldn't raise a dispute since the device isn't physically defective.\nYour best bet now is contacting Apple, and I do not think they would give you the Apple ID. Have you tried contacting the person you purchased it from? \n\nA: You need to talk to the seller.\nYou do not need they id and password.\nThey should not give that out anyway.\nAsk them to do following:\n\nRemoving an associated device or computer from an Apple ID\nTo remove a device or computer from your Apple ID:\nOpen iTunes.\nSign in to your Apple ID by choosing Store > Sign In from the iTunes menu.\nChoose Store > View My Account from the iTunes menu. \nFrom the Account Information screen, click Manage Devices.\nClick the Remove button next to the device name you would like to unassociate.\n\nNote: Removing a device from your Apple ID does not override the\n  90-day timer.

I now have an iphone. I have to send her texts using SMS (turned it on in settings) but when she answers I do not receive her replies on my iphone 5.   I've noticed my messages to other iphone users are not always iMessages anymore.  Frustrated with not being able to communicate with granddaughter.  Does it have anything to do with the droid was my phone before and used same number?\n\nA: It doesn't have to do with your Number, it's a known Bug which happens to all iPhone Android switchers.\nIt has to do with the way Apple has made its iMessage service.\nThanks to an ongoing issue with the way Apple built its iMessage platform, users who switch away from an iPhone to an Android phone or any other cell phone are faced with a huge problem: once they bail on the iPhone, they often can’t receive text messages from contacts who are still using iPhones. This is because Apple’s system still sees them as iMessage users, and it tries to deliver messages sent using Apple’s Messages app as iMessages. To make matters even worse, the iPhone users who send those messages see their status as “delivered” even though they are not being received.\nsource http://bgr.com/2014/05/19/fix-imessage-iphone-bug-android-sms/.\ni hope this will help you.\n", "Q: Can Apple block someone for updating?

I think apple doesn't seed any Updates for the Betas anymore. They have a new Beta OS now.\nIt could be that Betas have its own Appstore/Update Servers and Apple maybe lately have taken them down or changed to Yosemitte Servers. \nIf he was in the Beta Programm or downloaded the Beta from Dev Center (Free Download) he doesn't automatically get access to the Final release of Mavericks for free he has to buy Mavericks from the Appstore like every one else, then he can install the non Beta Mavericks and then get the Updates.\n", "Q: Don't want iBooks to always paste the \"Excerpt From\" of what I have copied I read on iBooks, and some other resources and gather my notes in EverNote.\nWhen I copy a text from iBooks to keep it as a note in some other external application like EverNote, it keeps pasting the source info which is so annoying and I have to keep deleting them after every copy-paste.

This is annoying, but not the end of the world.\nThe script for the Run Shell Script action:\nsed -E -e '1h;2,$H;$!d;g' -e 's#.*“([^”]*)”.*#\\1#g'\n\nThe first -e makes sure sed works with multiline input (huge thanks to the person who posted this answer).\n\nA: You could use Keyboard Maestro to trigger the following AppleScript:\nset original_clipboard to the clipboard\nset paragraph_count to count of paragraphs of original_clipboard\n-- assuming the last two paragraphs are what you want to strip out--\n-- that is, the blank line and the attribution\nset new_clipboard to paragraphs 1 thru -2 of original_clipboard as string\nset the clipboard to new_clipboard\n-- now you can paste\n\nWith Keyboard Maestro you would make a new macro, triggered by some keystroke (maybe Command-Option-V), and the first step would be an \"Execute an AppleScript\" (in the Execute section) using the above script. The next step would be a \"Paste\" (in the Clipboard section). You would copy your text, then click where you want to paste it, then press Command-Option-V to have it pasted in without the last two paragraphs.\nOther macro programs would work too as long as they know how to execute an AppleScript.\n\nA: Here is a solution that requires no third-party software and lets you keep using the standard ⌘C shortcut to copy text in Books.\n1. Create a Quick Action “Copy without Citation in Books”\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator and choose File > New (⌘N).\n\n*For the type of document, choose Quick Action.

Name it “Copy without Citation in Books”.\nThe “workflow receives current text in Books” setting in the workflow bypasses the clipboard-modifying behavior of Books. Thus, the workflow needs no extra action to strip the text added by Books.\n2. Give the Quick Action a keyboard shortcut of ⌘C in Books\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Keyboard. View the Shortcuts tab and select App Shortcuts on the left.\n\n*Click the + button to add a new App Shortcut.\n\n*Fill in the sheet as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Application: Books\n\n*Menu Title: Copy without Citation in Books\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: ⌘C\n\n\n*Click Add. You will see the shortcut appear in the list:\n\nAnd you’re done. From now on, when you want to copy your selected text in Books, just press ⌘C and the exact text will be copied.\n\nA: I have created a script for ClipMenu (macOS clipboard utility) to strip unwanted information:\nreturn clipText.replace(/^“/, '').replace(/”\\s*Excerpt.*iBooks\\.\\s?$/, '');\n\nSave as /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/ClipMenu/script/action/iBooks.js\n\nA: Below are steps for copying text from iBooks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Highlight the passages you wish to copy.\n\n*A popup will be opened automatically or you must open a popup using a right click on selected passages.\n\n*Select the 'Add Note' option from the popup.\n\n*The selected/highlighted text will be shown on the left pane.\n\n*Right click on the passages in the left panel and select the 'Copy' option.\n\n\nI have created a video to show how it works: https://youtu.be/ZQLl_Gl9TMw\nHappy coding!\n\nA: Here is how to set up a Keyboard Maestro macro to strip the extra text, including the quotation marks, the moment the text is copied from iBooks.\nFirst, create a macro group called “iBooks-specific mapping” and add iBooks within “Available in these applications”. (In more recent macOS versions, the application will be named Books instead of iBooks.)\n\nThen create a macro named “Copy Without Citation”. Assign it the hot key ⌘C. Give the macro the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clipboard > Copy\n\n*Clipboard > Search and Replace\n\n\n*\n\n*Search: System Clipboard\n\n*for: Regular Expression (case sensitive)\n\n\n*\n\n*^“\n\n\n*and replace with:\n\n\n*\n\n*(leave empty)\n\n\n\n*Clipboard > Search and Replace\n\n\n*\n\n*Search: System Clipboard\n\n*for: Regular Expression (case sensitive)\n\n\n*\n\n*”\\s*Excerpt.*Books\\.\\s?$\n\n\n*and replace with:\n\n\n*\n\n*(leave empty)\n\n\n\n\nThis is how it will look in Keyboard Maestro:\n\nNow any text in iBooks copied using that keyboard shortcut will have the extra text stripped from both ends.\n\nA: One workaround is\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the text\n\n*Click Translate Selection\n\n*Choose output language as the same one you're reading\n\n*Click Copy Translation\n\n\nA: from Amir Raminfar's answer.\nthis is a way if you want copy directly without Command C to save content to clip board.\n\njust change Workflow receives current to: \"text\" in \"Books.app\"\nand disable get contents of Clipboard.\n\nA: This blog post gives an example of how to do it using an Automator script with a keyboard shortcut.\nIn Automator, create a new Quick Action that receives no input. Give it these three actions:\n\n*\n\n*Get Contents of Clipboard\n\n*Run Shell Script\n\n*Copy to Clipboard\n\nPut this in the Run Shell Script action:\n# strip out iBooks citation\nsed -E -e 's/^[ ]?[0-9]* //g' | sed -E -e 's/“[ ]?[0-9]?[ ]?//g' | sed -E -e 's/”$//g'  | sed -E -e 's/^(Excerpt From).*//g'\n\n\nAfter saving the service, you can assign a shortcut to this action, such as ⌃⌥⌘I, in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Then you hit that shortcut before you paste if you want to get rid of the text that iBooks added.\n\nA: An altogether different approach is to abandon iBooks (/Books) and use a different eReader.  Having spent a long time failing to implement several of the above solutions, I think it is a valid alternate to choose an eReader that does not pollute the clipboard contents with the citation, curly quotes and invisible control characters.  My suggestion to you is Calibre.  Calibre's main purpose is to convert between book formats, but it has a competent viewer which has all the features you get on the Apple product, albeit not as beautifully presented.\nhttps://www.calibre-ebook.com/\n\nA: On my machine running Catalina, the solution in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/382603/449477 worked beautifully. However, this was not the case when using the same solution on my other machine running Monterey.\nI attempted to follow the solutions proposed above, but the biggest barrier was working with regular expressions passed to sed - I'm not great with regular expressions and ran out of patience. I figured I'd be a lot happier if I could get the clipboard contents (with the citation) into Python where I could then use some tools I'm a bit more comfortable with to strip the citation.\nThis involved creating a Shortcut as shown below:\n\nThis passes the clipboard contents to the script, which can easily read this input using sys.stdin.read() and then manipulate as needed. The particular implementation shown below to remove the citation is not very elegant, and may break depending what I try to copy out of Books, but it works for now. The important part is that should it ever break, I'm much more confident that I can quickly fix in Python rather than going back down the regex rabbit hole. The contents of copy-from-books-without-citation.py are below:\nimport sys\n\ndata = sys.stdin.read()\n\nremove_citation = data.split('“',1)[1].rsplit('”',1)[0]\nprint(remove_citation)\n\n\nA: The solutions with sed command seems to not work properly with Unicode content, so I decided to create my own solution in Python and a detailed guide.\nThe solution I made here is sure to work on macOS Monterey 12.6, released on Sep 12, 2022.\nGoal\nThe goal is to create a keyboard shortcut (like ⇧⌘C) in Apple Books that copy texts without the annoying citation info.\nGuide\nStep 1. Download remove_citation.py from this repo.\nSave it in an easy-to-access path like ~/scripts/remove_citation.py\nStep 2. Make sure python3 is available.\nA way to do this:\n\n*\n\n*Install Homebrew.\n\n*Install Python3 and pip3: brew install python3\n\n*(not necessary) Install pyperclip: pip3 install pyperclip\nThere may have been python3 in your mac. Probably at /usr/bin/python3.\nThe python3 installed with Homebrew may not be the default python3 used in automator shell scripts.\nStep 3. Create the Quick Action in Automator\nCreate a new Quick Action in Automator like this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Receive text in Books.app\n\n*Run shell scripts with command:\n\n/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 <path_to_the_dir>/remove_citation.py\n\n\n\n*Copy to Clipboard\n\n*Save the workflow with a name like \"Copy without Citation.workflow\".\n\nRemember to replace <path_to_the_dir> with your own path to the script.\nMaybe replace the python3 path too with the result from which python3 or just python3.\nStep 4. Create a Keyboard Shortcut\nGo to: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Text > Copy without Citation\nAssign a shortcut (like Cmd + Shift + C) to it.\n\n(optional) Step 5. Allow Books.app to access the script\nWhen using the quick action in Books.app, you may encounter an error saying \"Operation not permitted\".\n\nThe reason may be that Books.app is not authorized to access the python script.\nTo solve this, you may grant Books.app Full Disk Access.\n\nThen the quick action should be functioning.\nOne More Thing to Keep in Mind\nWhen you select texts in Apple Books, a small menu shows up.\n\nThe keyboard shortcut and quick action won't work when the menu is shown.\nYou need to click somewhere else to close the menu before using the keyboard shortcut.\nMy Repo\nhttps://github.com/Roger-Wu/remove-apple-books-citation\n\nA: After playing around with this for a while I found a fairly simple solution to this problem using Automator. It requires three separate keystrokes, however. First you have to copy the text in Books, using Command-C. Then create an Automator quick action that does the following three actions:\n\n*\n\n*Get Contents of Clipboard\n\n*Filter Paragraphs to return paragraphs that begin with “\n\n*Copy to Clipboard\n\n\nI assigned the keystroke Command-Shift-I to this quick action.\nOnce it's all set up, you can copy a piece of text in Books, then run the quick action, then paste it wherever you like.\nYou would think it would be easier to make the first step of the quick action be \"Copy to Clipboard\" and then you wouldn't have to begin with Command-C; unfortunately, copying inside of Books doesn't seem to function normally. I even tried adding Command-C via the \"record keystroke\" method and it still produces wonky results. So, after wasting several hours trying to build the copy selection step into the workflow I decided to just accept it as a three step process: copy selection, trigger quick action, paste revised selection.\nWhat you can do to streamline a bit, if you have Alfred installed on your computer, is create an additional Alfred Workflow triggered by a hotkey that triggers, in sequence, the following \"dispatch key combo\" events: Command-C, and then Command-Shift-I (or whatever keystroke you assigned to your Automator quick action.\n\nA: With Alfred, you can do copy without citation:\nopen this link to download Alfred workflow\n", "Q: How to import photos from iPhone 3G to iPhoto in Mavericks?

I have communicated with Dave from Shirt Pocket who advised that Super Duper usually has a lag like this when there are network drives mounted on my machine (i.e. Super Duper would attempt to scan these resulting in the lag). When I turn wifi off, Super Duper starts up immediately.\nI don't have any network drives mounted on my machine and so this has all been very mysterious.\nLast night, I installed WireShark and tried to see if there's anything interesting going over the wire.

The request from my machine to the router sometimes happens repeatedly (i.e. 2 or 3 times) before the notice of failure returns from the router.\nI'm not very familiar with using WireShark and reading information off packets in this way (indeed, it's very odd that this is causing any issue with Super Duper at all given that it shouldn't be going out on the network to look for stuff as I don't have any network drives setup at all on my Mac) - my question here is: does anyone know what is happening here and why do I get a server failure from my router? Internet is working with no apparent issues.\nIn case it becomes relevant: this is on a 2012 MacBook Air with OSX 10.9.4 plus the latest versions of Super Duper and WireShark.\n\nA: \"Server failure\" is, according to RFC 1035, an error that means that \"The name server was unable to process this query due to a problem with the name server.\"  That error code doesn't provide enough information to indicate what the problem is; it could be that the router is having a problem, or it could be that the router is talking to some other name server and got an equally mysterious \"server failure\" error from that server.\nWhat's the host name it's trying to look up?\n", "Q: Contacts missing after syncing with I cloud and gmail I already synced my contacts on my iPhone 4s to my Gmail but I noticed that \nnot all contacts were transferred.

I can even select all the text in a mail, but I cannot see it or increase the height.\n\n*It takes more than one second (!) to display a conversation, no matter how many mails are in it. Used to be instant. Single mails are still displayed instantly.\n\n*Sometimes the conversation indicator (e.g. that [2>] in the screenshot is missing even if it actually is and loads a conversation.\n\n\nMail is working fine if I disable conversations in the view menu. But I like the converation view and would like to keep it.\nBroken output:\n\nExpected output (this is OS X 10.9.3 on my virtual machine):\n\nI tried the following things\n\n\n*\n\n*no logs in Console.app\n\n*I deleted all accounts and all mail settings I could find in my ~/Library/ - no change\n\n*I created a new user on my MacBook and entered one of my mail accounts - same problem\n\n*switched language to English - no change\n\n*compared md5 of /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/MacOS/Mail with other Mail.app's, it still d1911cc8cbdaabc61c409d65b262c5ee - binary not broken\n\n*Used my virtual machine with Mac OS X 10.9.3 (everything works fine), replaced /Applications/Mail.app with the version on my 10.9.4 system, still works fine - Mail.app is not causing the problems\n\n*compared sizes of /System/Library/Private Frameworks/Mail*.framework - exact same bytecount\n\n\nA: I fixed the problem downloading the OS X Mavericks 10.9.4 Update (Combo) from the Apple website and installing it again. Either the App Store version was broken or something went wrong during the installation.\n\nA: Testing on MacBook Air with 10.9.4 and mail 7.3:\nTo expand the preview window (right side) in the conversation view, there should be (I have it) a \"see more from ...\" in the first email (at the bottom of it, in blue font) of the conversation list.\nClicking on it shows full conversation for each email in the conversation group.\n", "Q: Creating a test environment for Mac software My company develops commercial Mac software. Our flagship product runs on OS X 10.6.8+. We want to improve our software quality with better and more comprehensive testing.\nWhat hardware and OS's should we supply our tester with? My thought so far is either a Mac Mini or an iMac with an SSD, lots of RAM, and either Parallels or VMWare so that he can run OS X 10.6.8, OS X 10.7, OS X 10.8, OS X 10.9, and OS X 10.10 in virtual machines.\nIs this feasible? Recommended? I'd love to hear your feedback.\n\nA: I use VMWare Fusion Professional for software testing. Virtual machines make regression testing and replay of problems wonderfully easy.\nI run a copy of VMWare Fusion on my older Mac Pro and it performs well. The professional edition allows for linked virtual machines – linked machines can share common content to save on disk space. Machines can quickly require ~20GB if no content is shared.\nSnow Leopard Server\nBe aware that Mac OS X 10.6 Server is required for a virtual machine. The standard client edition is not permitted to run within a virtual environment.\nOS X 10.7 and later can all be legally run within a virtual environment, so long as the underlying hardware is an Apple computer.\nMaximise Resources\nYou are right to opt for as many resources as possible for your Mac. Running virtual machines can push your Mac. Try not to require needing multiple virtual machines running at once.\nGraphical Limits\nGraphical applications or those needing OpenGL support are not yet well supported by either VMWare or Parallels. OS X copes but falls back to software rendering; this may not best match your customers' environment.\n\nA: It is possible to run mutliple Virtual Machines on a Mac - i7 Macs with geq 16GB of RAM should be okey. If your Application does not need to much resources.\nI think there are better Solutions - for Example a Beta Version ... I don't know what Application you would like to test, and how large the usernumber is.\nAlso interesting is: you can run on a VMware a Macintosh System - so if there is a Virtalization Server or sth like that already in your Company - try to start there a virtual instance ;) \nEdit_2:\nYou can run on Non Apple Hardware a virtual MacOS but if you are in the US you will violate the EULA - here is the Point. For Example in Germany there is no DMCA clause and also the EULA not valid in this form. \nSources: Ask-Different - Chip.de - lowendmac  - \nChip.de\n", "Q: Applescript to set Track Comment to Rating I'm trying to develop an applescript that sets the comment tag to the track's rating.  i.e., if it's a 3 star track, I want the comment to say \"3 Star\".\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n  set theTrack to (item 1 of (get selection))\n  set comment of theTrack to theRating\nend tell\n\nThis isn't working for me.  Any Ideas?\n\nA: First thing is that the rating value is just stored as \"rating\". But iTunes stores the star rating as a value between 0 and 100, so you need to convert from that value to the number of stars.\nThere might be a smarter way to do this but this code seems to work.\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set theTrack to (item 1 of (get selection))\n    set theRating to rating of theTrack\n    if theRating = 100 then\n        set comment of theTrack to \"5 Star\"\n    else if theRating ≥ 80 then\n        set comment of theTrack to \"4 Star\"\n    else if theRating ≥ 60 then\n        set comment of theTrack to \"3 Star\"\n    else if theRating ≥ 40 then\n        set comment of theTrack to \"2 Star\"\n    else if theRating ≥ 20 then\n        set comment of theTrack to \"1 Star\"\n    else if theRating = 0 then\n        set comment of theTrack to \"0 Star\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n", "Q: iMessage altered on iPad iPhone Have a copy of iMessages and one in the string is a photo I did not send and looks like it was sent with my name.  I know you can delete messages from iMessage string.\nHow is it possible that one I never sent was inserted?\n\nA: It is very difficult to answer from your description. The most likely reasons are:\na) You forgot that you sent it.\nb) You sent it without knowing that you did so.\nc) Someone borrowed one of your devices and send it on your account.\nd) You gave your iMessage password to someone, or they guessed it, and they sent the message on your account.\nIt is much more unlikely that it happened due to Apple employees manipulating your iMessages or NSA staff doing the same - and much more unlikely than bugs in the iMessage system letting other people's images appear as being sent from you.\n", "Q: Macbook boots up to grey 'prohibited' symbol I'm having an issue with my '09 13\" Macbook Pro. When I boot it up, it seems to be booting normally until about thirty seconds in, when the Apple symbol is replaced with a kind of 'no-smoking' symbol, without the cigarette in the middle.\nI've removed the drive one and put it in an external holder, and repaired it using Disk Utility on my Macbook Air. It found some things, and said it repaired them. I then put the drive into my Macbook Pro again, and it booted once to only one of my partitions. It acted very laggy and slow, and eventually I had to force kill it with the power button. Now it does the same thing.\nI'm in the process of removing the hard drive to try to repair it again, but I wanted to know if anyone here has any ideas on what this could be. Is it the machine itself somehow?\nI see this:\n\n\nA: There are times when Apple's 'Disk Utility' software isn't as thorough at repairing problems that other applications may be.\nI've had 'Disk Utility' tell me that drives are fine, but it is not until after running a program like 'Disk Warrior' (that replaces the Directory structure), that the hard drive feels 'normal' again.\nThis isn't to plug any particular software, but to let you know that 'Disk Utility' isn't the be all, end all of determining if a hard drive is 'good'.\nGiven your description of the problem, I'd be inclined to make sure I had a backup. If not, purchase a new hard drive, and get all the data off of the old one as quick as possible. (I agree with @Asmus that it appears that you are about to lose a hard drive).\nOn the other hand, you may just need to have the mac reinstall the OS, and fix things that way. Either way - make sure you have a solid backup right away.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Does Time Machine do all I need? I use Time Machine for regular backups, and I have multiple HDDs for redundancy. This works fine for my computer, but the problem is that I have many files that do not reside in my computer and should be synced between these HDDs.\nFor example, photos from iPhoto: from time to time I have to free up space in my computer so the photos goes to the backup disks and I erase them from my computer. The mess increases with my wife doing the same thing with her Mac.\nSo what I'm looking for is a solution where I can tell my computer that I don't want certain files to be in it anymore, they should go to the backup, and that also the backup should be synced between the HDDs.\nIs this possible to achieve using only Time Machine or any non-third party tool? If not, are there any third party solutions that do it?\n\nA: Time Machine is a Backup Tool, not a File-Management Agent.\nAll it does, is copying new files to the HDD (as a mirror) and all older/deleted files go into a time-stamped archive.\nIf the disk is full, time machine deletes old stuff.\nI assume you want to manage the data. Nit really \"backup\".\nBecause you do not copy them, you move them to the disk.\nI also assume you have 2 Hard-Drives (1 for you and 1 for your wife), that should be in sync.\nSo in total you have 2 Macs and 2 Hard Drives.\nNow Unix has a very popular command called 'rsync'.\nYou can sync (copy) or move data via rsync to the Hard Drive.\nRsync is command-line based, so it is a bit difficult.\nBut i would recommend it for your situation.\nAnd because I was bored, here is a starting point for you.\n", "Q: Photo browsing and viewing application Can anyone recommend a good photo browsing application.\nI have hundreds of photos in well organized folders categorized by year and location where they were taken on my mac but I want a way to actually look at them that fast and simple.\nAny ideas?  I am happy to buy an app from the app store.\n\nA: I use Picasa from Google for that.\nIt is not intrusive (will leave your photos in place), and it will not make duplicates (saves space on your disk).\nIt also comes with Google web space (so you can upload/download) and easy share with others.\nHere is what they say about them self:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Picasa does not store the photos on your computer.\n  \n  \n  When you open Picasa, it simply looks at the folders on your computer\n  and displays the photos it finds. It displays the file types that you\n  tell it to find, in the folders that you tell it to search.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your original photos are always preserved.\n  \n  \n  When using editing tools in Picasa, your original files are never\n  touched. The photo edits you make are only viewable in Picasa until\n  you decide to save your changes. Even then, Picasa creates a new\n  version of the photo with your edits applied, leaving the original\n  file totally preserved.\n\n\nA: Perhaps just wait for the new Photos.app within MAC OS 10.10 coming in the Fall.\nIf you need to do something right now, Picasa is an option.\nThough, you may want to just import them all into iPhoto, you can disable iPhoto from making copies of the photos on import (in preferences) and instead just reference the photos where they are currently while still having them to view in iPhoto.\nThere are other options of course, but they require paid software which might be unnecessary. \n", "Q: My MacBook Pro has a flashing question mark in a folder against a grey background My MacBook Pro shows a grey screen with a flashing question mark in a folder.\nI tried connecting it to an older MacBook using firewire cable. I restarted the Macbook Pro in Target Mode. Now I see Thunderbolt and Firewire icons flashing and moving in a grey background. There is a green power icon at the bottom as well.\nI am not an expert even though I have been using Macs for ages.\nHow can I fix this issue so I can recover/backup things in the MacBook Pro hard drive?\n\nA: Either the Mac OS X installation is corrupt and won't startup the computer or your hard drive is faulty, physically.\nYou could try to connect another Mac to your mac via Firewire or Thunderbolt in Target Disk mode to actually see something. \nThat's what the Target disk mode is made for.\nYou could also try booting from the original DVD/USB, then run Disk Utility. If you can see the hard drive in the list, try repairing the disk.\n\nA: Have you tried using the \"Recovery Tool\" when booting?  \nHold down the Command-R keys while booting during the grey screen.  Full details can be found on OS X Mavericks Reinstall\nThat procedure should keep all your files intact.  Also, you should be able to get to the Disk Utility and run some first aid and disk checking procedures there.\nIf that dosen't work then try downloading Ultimate Boot CD.  It is a Linux based disk, but I personally have used it to diagnose issues with Macs in the past.  There are a number of HDD utilities that will test out your hardware for you so you can make a determination if your hardware is good or bad.  (Make sure you use the nondestructive tests)\nIf you hardware fails, you will need to get a new drive.  You may be able to rescue the data but if you haven't done anything like this before you may want to enlist the help of a pro.\nIf it passes, then somehow your data got corrupt.  You can typically re-intstall the OS without overwriting all your files.  \nOr...\nNow is a good time for a drive upgrade.  I would go with an SSD drive and then turn that old drive into an external USB drive for Time Machine backups or extra storage.  If you go this way, you have an even better chance of recovering your files while gaining use of your computer as you work through the recovery process.\nLet us know how things work as you work through the diagnostics.\n", "Q: Restoring past purchases with changed Apple ID How can I restore my past purchases if I wish to change my Apple ID?\n\nA: At the Moment there is no Option to merge two iTunes Accounts ...\nBUT:\n\n\n*\n\n*you can redownload from the old and purchase with the new one\n\n*if you only want to change your e-Mail as \"Account\" everything is the same. \n\n", "Q: iPhoto 9.5.1 deleting photos and library! iPhoto 9.5.1 recently just deleted my photos.

It seems that Time Machine does not back up iPhoto in Mavericks, so I've been reading. I cannot find the iPhoto file anywhere in Time Machine.\nWhere are those photos that were suddenly gone MIA?\n\nA: OK. Please follow those steps : \nOpen IPhoto 9.5.1 while pressing the \"alt\" key. Select \"New\". Name it Iphoto Library 2 for exemple. Press Enter, let IPhoto open.\nNow, go into your Pictures folder. Find the IPhoto Library.

When I log into icloud on macbookpro I can't see any photos or shared streams. Can anyone help?\n\nA: On your mobile device you open the icloud photo stream by its title, tap on \"people\", turn on \"public website\"  then tap \"share\" and send  the stream to your own email. In your email you will get a link to your photo stream under the title of the stream . When you click on the link from your laptop or desktop you will find a webpage with all items in that stream including your videos. Get a video web downloader add on extension for your browser and you can download the video once you've clicked on it to start. From there you can import it to iphoto and sync it with your iphone photos\n\nA: Since iCloud can be unreliable, the best method would be to plug in your phone over USB and copy it from there.\n\nA: I just use dropbox, videos automatically go into the camera uploads folder. If the video isn't showing up because it already got moved to your icloud click the video and hit edit so that it downloads to your phone then plug back in and it will copy to your dropbox camera uploads folder. It can be a pesky process if it's more than one video, wish there was a quicker way.\n\nA: There is now an app available for iOS that allows downloading of videos, live photos, and pictures from Shared Albums:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shared-album-enhancer/id1266163789?mt=8\nDisclosure:  I am the app developer.\n\nA: You can download videos to your computer from photos. Preferences > iCloud\nTo make your folder a system folder you need to select Use as System Photo Library from the General tab. Then it's usable with iCloud.\nIn my case, I had too many photos in my current photo library so enabling iCloud Photo Library lead to Apple forcing me to upgrade. To bypass the upgrade I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Photos library (I called my 'iCloud Library')\n\n*Open the new Library, which is emtpy\n\n*Set new library as the System Library, you can change this later\n\n*Enable iCloud Photo Library and set it to Download Originals to this Mac (you'll need enough space, I'm using an external)\n\n*After they are all downloaded you can drag them from your iCloud folder to your original Photos folder\n\n*Delete the iCloud folder and set your main library back to the system library\n\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Can I use Alfa long distance Wi-Fi with AppleTV AirPlay?

Spotlight does pretty much, but it lacks two critical features.\n\n\n*\n\n*It cannot search arbitrary locations.

I'm not going to do the most advanced of sorts but just custom intros, texts, minor particle effects and so on.\nBecause if it won't work well I don't want to pay for Premier Pro.\n\nA: According to the Adobe Premiere Pro support site, you'll need this : \n\n\n*\n\n*Multicore Intel processor with 64-bit support\n\n*Mac OS X v10.8 or v10.9\n\n*4 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)\n\n*4 GB of available hard-disk space for installation; additional free space required during installation (cannot install on a volume that uses a case-sensitive fi le system or on removable fl ash storage devices)\n\n*Additional disk space required for preview files and other working files (10 GB recommended)\n\n*1280 x 800 display\n\n*7200-RPM hard drive (multiple fast disk drives configured for RAID 0 recommended)\n\n*QuickTime 7.6.6 software required for QuickTime features\n\n*Optional: Adobe-certifi ed GPU card for GPU-accelerated performance \n\n*Internet connection and registration are necessary for required software activation, validation of subscriptions, and access to online services.\n\n\nSo your MBA should be good for it.

But be careful not to fill up your Hard Drive with the games you install as they can stack up your Hard Drive pretty easily.\nI would suggest to install all PC games on an external Hard Drive. Since filling up the SSD could potentially slow down the performance and boot-up speed.\n", "Q: Issue with multiple desktops I have a mac mini with two monitors. On the main monitor I normally keep two desktops and on the second there is only one. I have been noticing that the main monitor seems to add more desktops by itself.\nSo I am not sure if I might be pushing some sort of shortcut to create another desktop or if there is actually something else happening.\nIf anyone has any ideas or if if you have had the same issue and fixed it I'd really appreciate your help.\n\nA: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18757?locale=en_US\nThis link explains it. Its a new(ish) feature. You can zoom to mission control (f3) or for those with a MacBook, and you have new haptic track pad, you just three finger scroll up and if you move your cursor to the top right corner of your screen you will see a plus sign appear. Click on this to add a new desktop. \nYou can get rid of it by Going back to mission control again (f3), where you will see all open apps, and you can just close it (them) by hovering your cursor over it and an x will appear on top left corner it, or anything else, out from there. If you're in mission control it's easy to inadvertently create additional desktops if you thro your cursor up out of your way.., I've done it a few times. \nIt can be super useful when you want one open for work and one for play, but that I guess is not the point. Easy to get and get rid of though.

I'm having issues with kernel panics on a mid-2010 Macbook Pro 15 inch. I have read many threads about this (What's the cause of GPU panics on macbook pro mid 2010?) and the thread that links to are good examples. The panics seem to be related to GPU/especially video for me. Mavericks made them less frequent, but they didn't go away.\nApple was able to tell me that the logic board has already been replaced (before the computer came into my hands, presumably as part of the extended warranty that was intended to fix this problem). \nGiven the age of my computer, I'm wondering what my best options are. Is a new graphics card certain to fix the problem? If so, is it best to send it to Apple or to try to order one and install it myself?\n\nA: Suggested problem tracing /and repair) steps (after each test the performances).\n\n\n*\n\n*Vacuum clean the inside of your Mac to improve cooling.\n\n*Google and Install gfxCardStatus, Leave on Dynamic Switching.

The audio input from the microphone on the EarPods will only work on compatible Android devices—this is not guaranteed. As far as I am aware, there are no Android devices which work with the remote controls on the wire.\n\nA: As you have probably Goolged the answer and found that there are to many possible combinations, without knowing your specific Android model  the generic answers is:\nAs already answered by George Garside, the audio output will work (you will be able to hear).\nThe extra functionality like Microphone input works on most HTC phones.\nThe earpods work on HTC phones (Android & Windows Phones). They do not work on Samsung & Nokia phones. The headset works on any device with a 3.5mm jack, but the mic only works on HTC phones. There may be an exception.\nThe Start/Stop playing does not work on most phones, but it has been reported that using a Application called Meridian player and Droid phone it kindoff works.\nSo why is that and what can you do about it.\nJust give you some background: From the outside the plugs look very much alike, but inside the engineers have decided (for unknown reasons) to switch functions for microphone).\n\nSo what can you do about that: you would need an adapter(bridge) to connect the 2 worlds of engineering.\n\nA: seems everything works with galaxy s4.. and galaxy tab 4\n\nA: Microphone and start/stop works on my galaxy core 2.

I need to rename term which is used many times.\nI've found the find and replace functionality but it appears to only replace one term at a time. Doing one at a time could take hours, is there a way to Find and Replace All?\n\nA: Here are the steps I took to Find and Replace a word with a word(s) in Pages app for iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap in the toolbar and tap Find in the popover.\n\n*When the search field appears at the bottom of the screen, type in the word(s) you’re searching for. The results are immediately highlighted in the document. Use the forward and back arrows to move through the document to see the results in context.\n\n*To replace the found term, tap (gear) to the left of the search field.\n\n*In the popover, you can refine your search by searching for matching cases or whole words only. Or, simply tap Find and Replace and a second text field appears to the right of the search field.\n\n*Type in the replacement word and tap Replace. Pages for iPad finds the first instance of the word and replaces it. Tap the forward and back arrows to find each instance and manually replace it by tapping the Replace button.\n\n*To automatically find and replace all instances of the word, tap and hold the Replace button until Replace All appears in the popover.

I've got to drop my MBP (2010 model) in to the Apple store asap to get it repaired and it'll be out of action for a week during a time I need it most. My thought process is, due to the urgency of it all, to get a Mac Mini to tide me over until the repair is complete and keep working in the mean time.\nIf I buy a Mac Mini, could I just do a time machine restore of my MBP to that and be up and running? Are there any associated problems?\nSecond thought is also, could I just swap out the drive in the Mac Mini with that of my MBP and be up and running without issue? (I know I'll have to put my MBP in for repair with a drive in, got that thought covered).\n\nA: I've had the best results restoring from Time Machine to a freshly formatted drive. I did this for a machine with lots of system modifications, (httpd.conf, ssh_config) and all of these files were restored. When I did that with an OS in place these files were missed. There were no problems when I restored to a clean drive. Everything was restored properly. So, if you buy a Mac Mini, format the drive before running the Time Machine restore.\nI recommend sending machines to Apple as stock as possible. I've put in known bad hard drives with the Apple Logo on them when sending a machine back to Apple. The hard drive was replaced and the primary problem was fixed. The drive swap would be fine, but unless you are in a big hurry I'd discourage it.\n\nA: This is completely doable. I recently swapped the 480 GB SSD from my MacBook Pro with a 250 GB SSD from my Mac Pro which was before part of a RAID0 configuration. Long story short, fired up setup, told it to recover from Time Machine and both machines were back in their previous state in no time.\nTechnically, you should be able to just swap the hard drives, but as I always recommend to have a backup anyway, you can just sit and wait for TM to finish.\n\nA: The Time Machine Restore program might fail because it is a different model.\nI once tried to restore my hackintosh from my time machine backup.  I had customized the model to be a 'MacBookPro8,3', so Time Machine stored that.  But to boot the Apple install CD, I used the nawcom mod CD first.  Nawcom told the Apple install CD that my computer was a 'HacBook1,1'.

The other day one of our employees mentioned being unable to get Thunderbird to start at login or cause Mail to not start--Mail was somehow set to start at login, and he couldn't change the setting persistently.  Since then, we have found that no matter how we go about setting login options, they are ignored and reset upon logging out/in.\nIt may be worth noting that we use LDAP-authenticated accounts with homedirs mounted via NFS.\nI've previously been through Apple's standard protocol of checking and changing these settings by right-clicking icons in the dock as well as in System Preferences -> Users and Groups, and checking the contents of /Library/StartupItems (which is empty), followed by deleting the ~/Library/Preferences file and letting the OS recreate it.\nUPDATE: I've since found a workaround which is quite clumsy, but works.  It appears to be some sort of strange issue with the permissions issued to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist (though they are the same as the permissions for every other file in that directory).  Running chmod 777 com.apple.loginitems.plist prior to making a single change, then waiting for the permissions to be reset before making each subsequent change to the list of login items allows the settings to work as expected.  The file must again be chmoded prior to a reboot or it won't be read properly.  In addition, these settings work as expected for the local administrator account, so I imagine the fact that we use network accounts is relevant.  For whatever reason, I didn't think to check that prior to my first post.\n\nA: Your workaround is the beginning of the right problem analysis.\nVerify that the ACL on ~/Library/Preferences are correct.\nLet's say your user name is BOB.\nWithin Terminal or xterm type:\n\n$ cd ${HOME}/Library\n$ ls -del Preferences\ndrwx------+ 9 BOB  staff  6324 Jul 31 14:10 Preferences\n 0: group:everyone deny delete\n 1: user:_spotlight inherited allow list,search,readattr,readextattr,readsecurity,file_inherit,directory_inherit\n$\nIf your ACL aren't exactly as above, and most notably completly empty,\ncheck that your NFS server is correctly configured to manage ACL.\nOn your Mac which is the NFS client, check with the mount command that the noacl option isn't turned on.\n\nA: This has happened to me before and we had to reset the login settings and turn if the computer, then it worked!

Other than the two links above, Google has not been particularly helpful.\n\nA: Looking at the database being opened by that SQLite snippet in Navicat I don't see any data there; I would assume that the iCloud move caused some changes but perhaps I am not viewing it right.\nIf you have a developer account you might look in the documentation for Address Book programming. There's pretty rich support for searching and I would be shocked if you couldn't look for matching dates.

But I would think it could be extended to handle them (if it still works?)\nGiven the above you might see if you can write a simple Swift app to spit out all entries with anniversaries. You can do command line apps with it. Applescript won't help you - the Contacts as interface doesn't seem to share out other type dates.\n", "Q: How to daisy chain 2 Thunderbolt devices on 1 Thunderbolt port?

It looks absolutely gorgeous but its 10-17 fps frame-rate is very disappointing. \nAre there any settings I can adjust to improve this performance? In Windows it can be \"tuned\" to max performance or battery saving; is there a similar setting in OS X?\nRight now it's on AC power (plugged on the wall), Activity Monitor is reporting that the video-card is being used for D3, is there anything else that I'm forgetting to check?\n\nA: I'm assuming you have the 15\" rMBP with the NVidia GT 750M. If you're trying to run at native resolution, 2880 x 1800, with full effects, that card is likely inadequate.\nThe GT 750M I would estimate is roughly equivalent with a Radeon HD 6850, 6770, or even lower, placing it fairly low on this benchmark chart for the original Diablo III.  The frame-rates there get down into the 20's, and you have a) 25% more pixels then their highest tested resolution, and b) the expansion which likely has had graphical updates in the intervening two years.\nIf you want better frame-rate, you must trade off fidelity.  Lower the resolution, lower graphical settings until you find something you're happy with.\n\nA: There's no such power settings in OS X. And even in Windows, all it does is dimming the display and changing the idle time for sleep. \nThat's not really going to make a difference(using it plugged in I mean), your performance will stay the same. I guess you're going to have to play it on lower settings if you want a higher framerate.\n\nA: Take the resolution down. Remember that the rMBPs have a native resolution that is way higher than 1080p, and expecting them to game at that resolution is perhaps expecting too much. I use a 2014 13\" rMBP (which uses Intel Iris, not an external Nvidia card), and I rarely have any issues running RoS at 1280x80x60 with textures to high and other settings to high or medium. With an external card, I would expect the game to run blisteringly at a sub-1080p resolution. But it's possible we have different expectations around portable gaming -- this certainly isn't a 'gaming notebook'.\n", "Q: Any app that attempts image or movie conversion locks up Last week I made the mistake of opening an old AVI file, which QuickTime automatically converted to m4v. Well it tried anyway; when it got to the end it locked up.\nSince then I cannot do any sort of image or movie conversion. QT Player continues to die immediately after launch. Any other program that tries to convert anything also locks up (beach ball). For instance, I just tried to export an image from iPhoto - dead. \nI assume that there's a file somewhere that lists which files QT was working on, and it keeps trying to open/convert them (I can see the windows open, then die). Does anyone know where this might be?\n\nA: QuickTime in Mavericks saves it's application state to /Users/USERNAME/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.savedState/. If you rename that last folder, then QuickTime should then essentially launch with a blank slate.\n\nA: Alistair's answer provided the key - when QT attempts a conversion it saves the file to:\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information\n\nI could see a file and a plist there. I deleted the file and restarted QT, and presto!\n", "Q: How to restore to Leopard/Snow Leopard from Lion without any disk? My friend has a Mid 2010 Macbook pro with Mac OS X Lion installed on it. She wants to restore it (as in format/erase and get a fresh start). However she does not have any disks. \nWhen trying to restore using the CMD+R option during the boot process she is asked to sign in with her account but then a message saying she does not have OS X Lion purchased under her account prevents her from continuing with the installation. Is there a way to buy this online so she can proceed?\nAlso, she has the Recovery Partition in her HD so going back to Leopard/Snow Leopard is also an option. Is it possible? How?\nAny hints on how to proceed without having to get an actual physical media is appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: There are two possible solutions from my limited knowledge:\nFirst method\nInstall the OS X Recovery Disc Assistant on a USB drive and reinstall Lion.\nFrom the OS X Recovery Disc Assistant guide:\n\nTo create an external OS X Recovery, download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant application. Insert an external drive, launch the OS X  Recovery Disk Assistant,  select the drive where you would like to install, and follow the on screen instructions.\nWhen the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant completes, the new partition will not be visible in the Finder or Disk Utility. To access OS X Recovery, reboot the computer while holding the Option key. Select Recovery HD from the Startup Manager.\n\nIf her Recovery partition won't let you install already, I'm guessing there's a chance this might fail, but it's a least free to test and see.\nSecond method\nBuy OSX Lion from Apple.\nOS X Lion is still sold by Apple, so you could just buy a new disc and install using it.\n\nA: Once you have upgraded your Macintosh's operating system there is no going back without already owning an official CD or a backup of the operating system available.\nYou are going to have to buy a complete new CD from the shops as said above are quite cheap so you may want to consider checking your local store.\nAlso I am running on a Late-2009 iMac so your friend running a 2010 model MacBook Pro should be able to upgrade to OS X 10.9 Mavericks for free from the App Store which is even better than Lion.\n", "Q: Possible to backup External Disk to Time Capsule regardless which machine it's connected to? Here's the scenario: I have two MacBook Pros (Foo and Bar), and their drive's are both called Macintosh HD. I have a Time Capsule called Time Capsule, which is used to back up both Foo and Bar. I also have an external disk called Stuff which I connect to both Foo and Bar.\nIs it possible to have Stuff backed up to Time Capsule in such a way that regardless of whether Stuff is connected to either Foo or Bar, the same destination on Time Capsule is used? I.e. can an external disk connected to two different computers be backed up to the same Time Machine disk without duplication?\nSeems like this might be possible with tmutil but I haven't been able to figure it out.\n\nA: well good question and well described. It is possible to BackUp 2 Macbooks Fooand Barto one TimeMachine Disk. \nI had some problems with SnowLeopard but with Mountain Lion it was a lot better and now with Mavericks it is working fine. \nSo if you have Mavericks installed on both it is no hassle so far in my Envirmonent (have 4 Macbooks and one TimeMachine Disk (in the Network))\nExample of may TM Diks\nTimeMachine\n|- Macbook Pro Martin\n|- iMac Martin\n|- MacPro Martin\n|- Macbook Air \n\n Folder has been renamed in this example \nSo the Devices are seperated in Folders on your TM Disk. \n", "Q: How to check how much RAM a program uses? Is there any recommended way of checking for this?\nThere is another thread:\nHow do I find how much disk space a program is occupying?\nI ask this question because I was under the impression that disk space is not the same as RAM. My computer is running slow and I would like to get to the cause, and the first thing I want to tackle is finding out which programs are taking up the most RAM.\nThanks!\n\nA: If you go to the Utility folder on your Mac, open the Activity Moniitor.\nThen go to the Memory tab.\nThere you will see who is using how much.\nThere is also a Disk Tab, where you can also see who is using how much on active basis (when programs are running). You wont see the passive usage (how much information is stored) in that window.\nIn this example the application Firefox\nUsing Memory:\n\nUsing Disk space:\n\nHow much space is a Application occupying on the disk, is answered by looking in your Finder -Applications then under the - Size coulomb.\nAgain in my example, the Firefox occupies 147 MB of permanent disk space, which is not the same as the information above which was for the active situation.\nBack to your original problem- slow computer:\nIn the Activity Monitor look now in the CPU tab to see who is most active there.\n\nA: Search on Spotlight for activity monitor - switch to the Memory Tab.\nThen you should see something like that:\n\nThere you will see how many memory each Process is using at the moment.\nI hope this answers you question.\n", "Q: Move data from 1 hard drive to the other I have a bootable partition on an external drive with some old data that I want to move to a new external hard drive. The partition on the old drive is 500GB however theres only 320GB of data. So i want to keep the partition bootable and resize it so that I don't have 180GB wasted on my new hard drive. How can I do this with disk utility?\n\nA: I think most disk imaging utilities will do what you are looking to achieve. Try Partition Magic or Macrium Reflect. In fact I know for sure that Partition Magic will automatically estimate the needed and resize the space as needed based on the original hard disk (and its partition) and the destination disk.\n", "Q: screen sharing from Windows to Mac over LAN What software do I need to install / use on a Windows box to be able to remote desktop into OSX locally on LAN?\nVersions don't matter really, but to be specific: OSX 10.7.5, with \"VNC viewers may control screen...\" enabled, Windows can be any flavor of 7 or 8.\nAs it has to be local but also because of the policy, I can't use commercial / free TV, CRD, LMI, etc. on the Mac side, and prefer not to install anything on the Mac as it already has a built-in VNC server (as well as ARD installed). I can however install viewers / clients on the Windows side.\nTried Real VNC (including Enterprise trial) - it gets stuck on the login screen and I can't get past it.\nAny ideas are welcome - thanks in advance.\n(Tried to find threads that ask (or answer) this exact question but couldn't find anything. Regardless - apologies if this is a duplicate.)\n\nA: According to Real VNC support, this is a 10.7 issue. I sort of confirmed it by successfully using Real VNC to connect to 10.6.8 and 10.9.3 hosts. Regretfully my Mac Pro (2,1) is too old in the tooth for OS X 10.9.x, so I have to figure out a different solution.\n", "Q: What is the RDUSB00E6Setupd process running by launchd What is the RDUSB00E6Setupd process running by launchd in a Macbook Pro with  Mavericks? I can't find any information about this and my computer is running quite slow, trying to figure out what is causing it.\n\nA: I found this on Google:\n\nUninstaller (jp.co.roland.rdusb00e6.uninstaller) is a Mac OS X\n  software application that has been discovered and submitted by users\n  of iBoostUp. The latest version that our iBoostUp users have reported\n  seeing on their systems is Uninstaller 1.0.0.\n\nIt sounds like you are trying to install the Uninstaller!\nIf you are not to be blamed :) go to Activity Monitor and kill the process.\nOpen terminal and search for the file\n\nmdfind -name rdusb00e6\n\n\nA: This is from a Roland/Edirol Audio interface.

I would recommend ImageMagick which you can easily install using Homebrew. Then the command is:\nconvert  InputImage.jpg -background blue -splice 0x100 PaddedResult.jpg\n\n\n\nIf you want to add transparent padding, use:\nconvert  InputImage.jpg -background transparent -splice 0x100 out.png\n\nIf you want to composite two images together, you can do this:\nconvert -size 1024x768 xc:blue 1024x768.jpg                    # create big blue image\nconvert -size 100x100 xc:red 100x100.jpg                       # create little red image\ncomposite -gravity northeast 100x100.jpg 1024x768.jpg out.jpg  # superimpose top right\n\nNote that I am creating my images first, you can obviously just use your own.\n\n", "Q: Export an email from Outlook to PDF?

External services are not an acceptable solution.\n\nA: You can use the \"Save as PDF\" option in the Print dialog (drop down is in lower left corner of the dialog window).\n\nA: Export an email from Outlook to PDF? you should read this technet article, which helps you save your Outlook PST mails as PDF format. https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Convert-PST-to-PDF-with-25f19205\n", "Q: iPhone will not connect to my wifi My iPhone says its connected to wifi but it won't let me surf the web. My iPad is using the same connection and I don't have a problem with it. Does anyone have any ideas what is wrong?\n\nA: Is there any IP address assigned? And if so, does it come from your router? (e.g., is it in the same range as a computer or other device that is connected to the same router? ) If it happens to start with 169.254.x.x, then there probably is something wrong with one of the router settings (probably DHCP not configured properly), as that indicates that your iPhone has a self-assigned IP-address. \nYou can check the IP-address by opening the Settings app, tapping Wi-Fi, and tap the blue information-icon (i) next to the connected Wi-Fi network. And are the iPad and iPhone the only two devices connected to that router? Or are there other devices that are successfully connected as well?\n\nA: The network settings may be corrupt on your iPhone.  \nOpen the Settings app and choose >> General >> Reset >> Reset Network Settings\nThis will wipe all previous settings for any wifi networks you've joined in the past and remove any cell tower connection history your phone has stored in memory.  Once the phone reboots it will look for the closest cell tower.  Then join your home WIFI as you normally would.\nIf that doesn't work its possible you may have more serious issues with your phone.

Further to a question I posted on Monday I'd like to know if anyone could shed light on whether this is possible.\nCan I take my MBP drive out, put it in a caddy, plug it in to an iMac and boot my drive via the external then run it as a normal setup? I understand this might run slower, hopefully not too much. The main thing though is to not have to break from routine for long to get things up and running (owing to a huge deadline a week out that my laptop is too unstable to meet).\n\nA: Yes: This is totally possible \nand you should not have any problems at all.\nYou should consider though, that every Mac has a minimum and a maximum OS X Version which is officially supported.\n", "Q: Knowing the format and the protection of a book in iBooks I bought a book on the iBooks Store. Is there any way to know what format it is and what protection if any it has? (PDF/EPUB, type of DRM, etc.)\nI use an iPad 3 with iBooks version 3.2 (last update: 2013.11.14).\n\nA: You can use iTunes to find out the format of the books on your iPad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install iTunes on your Windows PC.\n\n*Plug your iPad in to your Windows PC, iTunes should detect it and a button should appear in the top right of the iTunes window just under \"Search Library\". Click on the button for your iPad.\n\n*You should be presented with a long horizontal list of options including \"Summary\", \"Info\", \"Apps\", etc. Click on the last option called \"On This iPad\".\n\n*You should then see a list of options down the left called \"Music\", \"Films\", \"TV Programmes\", etc. Click on Books.\n\n*Now you should have a list of your books in the centre of the iTunes window. Right-click on the book you want to know the format of and select \"Get Info\".\n\n\nThe window that appears will tell you the \"Kind\" of book it is. If I remember correctly they are \"Protected book\" for IBA or EPUB books with DRM, \"Puchased book\" for IBA or EPUB without DRM and \"Book\" for PDF files. \n", "Q: OSX Mavericks Kernel Panic I am running Mavericks on a mid 2013 macbook air (haswell).

What steps to do I take to restore one photo only for my iPhoto library from a Time Machine?\n\nA: It might not be the most user-friendly way, but one possibility would be to locate the backup file in finder (very probably in Backups.backupdb/latest on your TimeMachine drive), navigate to Macintosh HD/Users/[user]/Pictures. Right-click the iPhoto-library, and choose 'show package contents'. Then open the Masters folder, and navigate to the date (year-folder / month-folder / day-folder). There will be a few folders in there with seemingly random names (on closer inspection you'll see this are the dates and times when they were added if i'm not mistaken), each of them will contain the pictures made on that date.

I'm trying to get around a strange problem concerning an iOS app my company produces. We use a branding process to brand a single executable, assigning it new resources and a new bundle id, but keeping the same core executable across brands.\nThe problem is when a phone has multiple different brands installed, disabling one app for cellular connectivity is inadvertently disabling all of them, and I can't figure out why.\nTo reiterate, each app naturally has its own bundle id, so why would disabling cellular data for one app cause it to break for other brands?\n\nA: I did some further investigation and experimentation, and from what I can tell, iOS is identifying the disabled app based on the app binary in some fashion. That is, the actual embedded executable file inside the app bundle, instead of the bundle id as one would intuitively expect.\nIf I create two different builds, and brand them into several brands each, then disabling one of the branded apps disables cellular connectivity for all brands in that group (i.e. that share the same underlying binary), but do not affect those brands built with a different binary. Furthermore, renaming the embedded binary file has no effect, so it's clearly basing it on the contents of the executable (perhaps a checksum or internal identifier).\nAs far as I can tell this is just a bug in the implementation of this feature on iOS, and I can't think of any way around this that doesn't involve completely changing how we are branding our apps. I've submitted a bug report to Apple.\n", "Q: Shortcut key for fullscreen mode I am new to Mac OS (2014 Macbook Air).\nI am looking at the arrow on top right corner of windows, when I click it, it maximizes window over the top menu and in order to switch back I need to hold mouse in top right corner in order for menu to appear and the button with arrows appears again to [kind of] minimize back as it was.\nIs there a shortcut key to switch between these modes ? I could only find the Command+M shortcut which completely minimizes the window.\n\nA: Try Fn+F, sometimes shown as F\n2022 Update:  The default shortcut in MacOS (I believe since MacOS 11 \"Big Sur\") is now Fn+F which \"out of the box\" seems to work for most applications (at least on my MacBook / Apple Keyboard).\nThe details described below though can still be helpful if you have applications that are not honoring the Fn+F shortcut or you want to change it to something else, like CMD+CTRL+F\n\nThis is very possible.\nI did the following and chose CMD+CTRL+F as a shortcut and worked on OSx 10.8 and upwards.\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences and click on the”Keyboard” icon Select the\n“Keyboard Shortcuts” tab and choose ‘Application Shortcuts’ from the\nlist on the left\n\n\n*Click on the + icon to add a new keyboard shortcut\nfor all applications and type the following exactly:\nEnter Full Screen\n(This is the label as shown in the menu of the application)\n\n\n*Now you need to assign it a keyboard shortcut, I chose Command+Control+F because it's the same as the general default that correctly mentioned\n\n\n*Click “Add” and then click on the + icon again, this time typing:\nExit Full Screen\nChoose the same keyboard shortcut as you chose before which in effect creates a toggle, and click onto “Add” again\n\n\n*Lastly click on the + icon again, this time typing:\nToggle Full Screen\nAgain, assign the same key combination of Command+Control+F\nAs you rightly said, applications like iTerm use this menu option, rather than Enter/Exit Full screen, but assigning to the same key makes it somewhat universal.\nIf you find an application that has full screen and isn't covered by the above shortcuts, add the menu item as above for that Application and again assign to the same short-cut key and all should be good.\n\n\nA: The button in the top right of each window is not for minimizing and maximizing the window, but for putting it in and out of fullscreen mode (which is why it covers the menu bar, as you said). \nThe keyboard shortcut to toggle fullscreen depends on the application.\nMost applications that I use on a daily basis (such as Google Chrome, Terminal, Mail, and Safari) use ^+⌘+F (Control+Cmd+F) to toggle fullscreen mode.\nUnfortunately, not all developers use this shortcut in their applications. iTerm, for example, uses ⌘+Enter to toggle fullscreen mode. If the application you refer to does not use either of these shortcuts, you should look for the fullscreen option in the View menu or by searching for \"fullscreen\" in the Help menu.\n\nA: Take 3 fingers and swipe across your trackpad from left to right. \nThat will get you back to the desktop real quick..not minimize the window completely. it accomplishes the same thing though and i prefer this method better cuz you can get back and forth from page by just a swipe back and forth..\n\nA: Mine is set to fn+F1 to toggle fullscreen on/off.  I can't remember if I set it as this, or if my mac came with it set as this.

I've read that /tmp will automatically have files deleted that are older than 7 days or upon restart, but I can't seem to find where this is documented.

How can I install WhatsApp on iPad mini (cellular)? It's not jailbroken and I am using iOS 7 but I cant install WhatsApp on it.\n\nA: WhatsApp Messenger is currently not optimised for iPad, and therefore you will need to search for iPhone apps in the App Store search using the filter at the top.\n\nA: There is one that I would recommend, it covers almost all features from WhatsApp Web and it is quite fast on iPad: iPad Messenger for WhatsApp - Free\nIt's very sad that WhatsApp does not offer a client for iPad and I've been trying a lot of ways to get it working on iPad without jailbreaking. The web version is for sure the most secure and reliable way to use it on iPad. It is actually pain less to use. The most of the apps on the App Store are not reliable at all because of the excessive ads showing. \n", "Q: Why won't my secondhand iPad let me activate an Apple ID?

When I try and create a new account underneath, it says that this device is not eligible for one.\nHow can I resolve this?\n\nA: Any device (whether iOS or OS X) has a lifetime limit of THREE (3) new iCloud accounts can be activated using it. \nOnce the third iCloud accounts has been activated from that device, that device cannot be used any longer to create/activate new iCloud accounts. \nApple allows the primary and the secondary account, after third they do this to you:\n\nThere is no way around that restriction.\nApple does this to prevent people from having free unlimited storage. \nSo unless you can use one of the exiting accounts you are out of luck.\nHere is some more reading material for the one complaining that I did not provide sufficient link/references:\nCan we have two iCloud accounts on our iPad?\niCloud on Mountain Lion: one account per Mac or one per user?\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/20755523\nPrimary and Secondary account\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ts4020\n\nA: What this basically is telling you is that you have already used 3 Apple ID's on the iPad (must be some pretty shifty owner before you) so you cannot add anymore to it.

Any data being synced with iCloud on this phone will be deleted from it when you delete the account, but will sync back with you sign back in later.\nAfter deleting the account, set up a new one with a different Apple ID.  Then delete this account from the phone and sign back into the original account to sync the iCloud data back to this phone.

This thing has appeared, hovering obtrusively over my desktop (Mountain Lion):\n\nI don't know how it got there. Presumably I pressed some key combination by accident. But I can't for the life of me figure out how to get rid of it again. It has \"Esc\" written on it, but pressing the escape key doesn't do anything. The arrow at the bottom takes me to \"Open Speech Commands window\" and \"Speech Preferences...\", but neither has any obvious option to turn this blue thing off.\nIn several online forums, the advice is to go to Speech Preferences -> Speakable Items and turn it off. But as you can see in the screenshot below it's already off, and the blue thing is still there.\n\nTurning Speakable Items on and off again doesn't help. The blue thing just becomes grayed out (the state it's in in the screenshot above) but doesn't go away.\nHow can I get rid of this thing so that I can watch a movie without it hovering over the top?\n\nA: I was also met with this speech popup a few weeks ago. It can be turned on or off system-wide, but is sometimes app-specific for when it appears. For me, it was because I was using the Chess app, which uses \"Speakable Items\" so that the player can speak moves.\nI had to uncheck \"Allow Player to Speak Moves\" in the Chess preferences pane.

As I normally do, I checked my HDD with the Disk Utility and found some trouble, then I boot on recovery mode to fix my HDD. I realize that the recovery partition was the Yosemite one (It's easy to see since the UI is different)\nI want to get back my Mavericks recovery partition, so I followed along this instructions.\nBut my diskutil list output is a little different:\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         499.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                  Apple_HFS EraseRecoveryHD         650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *496.1 GB   disk1\n\nI deleted my recovery partition successfully with the command:\ndiskutil eraseVolume HFS+ EraseRecoveryHD disk0s3\n\nBut when trying to merge using this command:\ndiskutil mergePartitions HFS+ \"Untitled 1\" disk0s2 disk0s3\n\nI get the following:\nThe chosen disk does not support resizing.\n\nI don't know why my disk0s2 does not have a name and why do I have a disk1\nBTW, I tried to avoid this trouble just by using the recovery partition I have (from Yosemite), I ran the repair disk option on recovery mode, then I booted on Mavericks and the disk utility says my HDD has the same problem as when I first checked.\n\nA: The simple solution is to reformat the whole disk and reinstall Mavericks from scratch.  Doing so will get your Mavericks recovery partition back and you can migrate your data back from time machine.  I get the feeling you don't want to do that however?\n\nA: Well, just I case this happens to someone else.\nIt seems Yosemite (beta 1) messes up with the HDD, as Fyrefly pointed out, Apple_CoreStorage represents two disks acting as one (for speeding up a HDD with an SSD). My MacBook Pro only has one HDD so that's strange.\nAfter I deleted the recovery partition I rebooted my MacBook Pro and it died. So the only solution at that point was clean install. My MBP got into Internet Recovery mode, fortunately I had a Mavericks.app file so I created a bootable USB.\nUse this command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app --nointeraction\n\nNote: Override with the path to your Mavericks.app file\nI think this is the simplest and easiest solution, maybe Yosemite breaks more things so It's better to do a clean install. (In my case, Ruby was broken).\n\nA: As far as I know, the recovery partition is always created with the exact size of 650MB (1269536 sectors), regardless of hardware and OS X version. As disk utility will refuse to copy just the recovery partition, the next obvious option is to dd the stock 10.9 recovery from another machine/disk with 10.9.\nHow to go about this largely depends on what hardware you have available. If you have another mac with the correct recovery partition, just connect your mac in target disk mode and over-write the recovery partition from the other Mac's running system.\nOne important thing - stock 10.9 recovery probably doesn't support CoreStorage, so it will be of little use if your system volume is on the CS partition. And if you need to move the whole system partition off-disk anyway, then that defeats the purpose of copying just the old recovery partition.\n", "Q: iMac (mid-2010) RAM upgrade issue I recently upgraded an iMac to 16 GB of RAM using 1600 MHz clock speed sticks.

If yes give me specific sites which will help me jailbreak it.\n\nA: 'Safe' is a broad term. If you keep a backup though, there's not much that can go wrong as you can always restore that backup. In addition, as there are no updates available for the 3Gs, you can safely restore to a jailbreakable version of iOS if anything goes wrong.\nAs the last version of iOS that can be installed on the iPhone 3Gs is iOS 6.1.6, this can be jailbroken using p0sixspwn. Download it, then follow the instructions.\n", "Q: Macfusion not working I would like to mount an SFTP drive on OS X. I tried MacFUSION but it doesn't seem to work, always gives \"Could not mount filesystem: Mount process has terminated unexpectedly\". According to Can MacFusion be used under Mountain Lion?, MacFUSION no longer works. Are there any alternatives or workarounds?\n\nA: If your looking for recommendations for anything FTP and SFTP, I would recommend either Fetch, or Transmit.  I don't know if there's a workaround to getting MacFUSION to work on Mavericks, sorry.\n", "Q: How can I make soundtracks with one artist sort as soundtracks in iTunes (and iPhone)? Most of the soundtracks in my iTunes library have the Album Artist tag \"Various Artists\" and so they all appear together in the V's in Albums view. A few soundtracks have only one artist (composer) or mainly one artist, and they appear in a different location.\nFor example, the soundtrack for The Incredibles appears with the M's for the artist, Michael Giacchino.\nShould I change the Album Artist tag to \"Various Artists\" to make it sort with the other soundtracks? Maybe I should change the Album Artist tag in all of my soundtracks to \"Soundtrack\".\nAny better ideas? Thanks!\n\nA: You've pretty much figured it out. Just pick a consistent description to use for the Album Artist or Sort Artist and your albums will group together, while being able to preserve the artist for a specific track. The de facto standard for this seems to be calling it \"Various Artists\", but there's no reason you can't do whatever suits you, whether that's \"Soundtracks\" or a specific title for each individual soundtrack album.\n\n", "Q: Using `rsync` as more advanced `cp` For copying large files (and/or large quantities of files), especially across disks, I prefer to avoid using the Finder as it often fails with some meaningless error message and/or complaint about permissions.\nInstead I have been looking at using rsync -- or, more specifically, the latest version of rsync available from Homebrew, which, as of today, is:\nrsync  version 3.1.1  protocol version 31\n\nCapabilities:\n64-bit files, 64-bit inums, 64-bit timestamps, 64-bit long ints,\nsocketpairs, hardlinks, symlinks, IPv6, batchfiles, inplace,\nappend, ACLs, xattrs, iconv, symtimes, no prealloc, file-flags\n\n(Those are the default capabilities that Homebrew uses.)\nThe problem is that rsync is hopelessly complex, and I'm never sure if I am using the proper arguments, or if there are others that I should be using:\nrsync \\\n    --8-bit-output \\\n    --acls \\\n    --backup \\\n    --devices \\\n    --exclude='.DS_Store' \\\n    --executability \\\n    --group \\\n    --human-readable \\\n    --inplace \\\n    --itemize-changes \\\n    --owner \\\n    --perms \\\n    --progress \\\n    --prune-empty-dirs \\\n    --recursive \\\n    --safe-links \\\n    --specials \\\n    --stats \\\n    --times \\\n    --update \\\n    --verbose \\\n    --xattrs \\\n    'foo' /path/to/destination/\n\nArgs I'm not sure if I should be using or not, mostly because I'm not 100% sure what they do:\n\n*\n\n*(one of the other options for links instead of '--safe-links')\n\n*--relative\n\n*--sparse\n\n*--partial\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\nA: Unless you have some specific needs, I would throw out most of those options and keep it simple: rysnc -aEv (on the default OS X version) or rsync -aXv (on the Homebrew version).\nOptions\n\n\n*\n\n*-a is archive mode, which essentially means preserve the metadata (timestamps, permissions, etc.) and do a recursive copy. This is what you want for your standard backup or copy operations.\n\n*-E/-X preserves extended attributes (a.k.a. resource forks). In the past the built-in rsync version had special functionality to cover HFS+ quirks in this regard, but newer default versions of rsync may be improved in that regard now. I would lean towards using the built-in version unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\n*-v is the verbose option, and simply makes it easier to track what's going on if you're running this in a Terminal window. If it's going to be running in a script, you can remove it.\nUnless you know you need them, you can safely ignore most of those options you've got already. Some are duplicated by the archive command, and others (like --inplace, which can slow things down and leave the filesystem in an inconsistent state) are only necessary for specific edge cases. Do yourself a favour and keep things simple — if you run into specific issues with the options I've listed, perhaps enumerate those (in a separate question if need be).\nAs an aside, running into problems copying via Finder is a bit of a red flag IMO. While it may not always be as fast as some options, it shouldn't be throwing error messages. You may want to verify/repair your disk in Disk Utility.\n\nA: you could use ditto which is a more advanced cp and was created by Apple. \n", "Q: Group by subject in iOS Mail app How do I make the default Mail app on iOS group by subject? I've enabled \"Organize By Thread\" but that doesn't help.\nOn my Mac (OS X 10.9.4):\n\nOn my iPhone (iOS 7.1.2):\n\n\nA: Mail on iOS, like on OS X, uses multiple factors to determine whether two or more emails are part of a thread. By not relying solely on the subject, Mail is able to keep a thread together even when other email programs/servers modify the subject (for example, adding \"RE:\"). This is seen by Apple as a feature and is not able to be modified.\nEnabling Organise by Thread is the best you can do. If the emails still don't group together, then Mail is determining that the emails are not part of the same thread and this can't be changed.\n\nA: As others said, that feature is not available in iOS 7, but it looks like it will be available in iOS 8.\nShow related messages:\n\nhttp://gizmodo.com/ios-8-the-best-hidden-features-that-apple-didnt-show-y-1586023628\n\nA: Unfortunately, here we are in iOS 10 and Apple still has not address this capability.  The Apple Mail app does not support thread organization with Subjects that do not match the \"multiple factors\" that @grgarside pointed out. \nSince this is not possible with the stock mail app, @Tonny suggested an alternative which is Outlook.  I have confirmed that Outlook does join conversations that have identical Subjects. \nAn example being the below which will work in Outlook but not iOS Mail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alert Message\n\n*Alert Message\n\n*Alert Message\n\n\nThe below will work in Outlook and iOS mail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Alert Message\n\n*RE: Alert Message\n\n*RE: Alert Message\n\n\nOutlook does not require the words \"RE:\" or \"FWD:\"\n\nA: You can use outlook. I had the same problem, but outlook does better grouping. Even in iOs9\n", "Q: I'm trying to purchase Keynote for Mac Os 10.7 How can I buy an older version of Keynote that's compatible with 10.7?\n\nA: You can purchase the iWork suite (which includes Keynote) from Amazon or a similar retailer. Searching the internet should help you, but I found iWork '09 for $19.99. Note that iWork '09 uses universal binaries so it will work on both PowerPC and Intel Macs.\nYou may want to check which versions are compatible with OS X 10.7. Wikipedia has a good table with OS X / iWork version compatibility.\nYou need either iWork '09 or iWork 9.x. If you are on OS X 10.7.4, you can run any version of iWork up to and including iWork 9.3. \niWork 2013 is only compatible with 10.9, so stick with versions prior to that one on Amazon or another retail site and you should be good. If the version you want is not on Amazon, check eBay or another website.\n\nA: The Mac App Store should let you download an older version compatible with 10.7 once you purchase it. \n", "Q: Reliable instruction on installing Ubuntu on Macbook Pro There are some walk-through kind of instruction on installing Ubuntu on Macbook Pro (as dual boot OS along with Mac OS X), such as Lifehacker's post.  But they are either too old that I worry if the particular details are still currently applicable, or the source is not particularly reliable.  Any pointer to a good, reliable, and current source on this?  I intend to install Ubuntu as a dual boot OS on my Macbook Pro (mid 2011 model).\n\nA: I think the following link will help you : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation#Detailed_How-To\nHere they have explained it very clearly:\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/10/dual-boot-os-ubuntu\nHope this will help you. \n", "Q: Launchpad Issue So I was cleaning up my launchpad since Adobe installs a lot of minor applications and I wanted to have them all in one folder. Then I moved all of those Adobe applications to a new folder but the old folder won't go away. It's just an empty folder with nothing in it.\nI have tried terminal commands, I have tried to hold in Alt and CTRL, I have done multiple restarts, putting things in the folder makes that item disappear and not show up unless I restart the whole dock. I have looked for a way to put a folder inside an another folder to hide it but that does not seem possible.\nIt annoys me but it does not bother me so much that I will do a re-install of Mavericks to make it go away. If there is no way to remove it, I will just have to live with it I guess.\nI have researched this issue with no success. I have only encountered people with the same problem on OS X Lion and the way they fixed it, is not possible on Mavericks, since I tried.\nThis happened after the update to Mavericks 10.9.4.\nMy specs:\nMacBook Air 13\" (Late - 2013)\nMavericks 10.9.4\n\nA: *\n\n*Add an item back to the empty folder that you can't delete.\n\n*Change the name of the folder to something else (doesn't matter what, just some random thing like \"asd\").\n\n*Take out the item you put in it.\n\n\nAfter these steps, the folder should be gone automatically. I got this solution from the last answer below in this Apple discussions thread.\n\nA: Perhaps give either of these apps a try - not exactly ideal to have to install a separate app to manage it but it doesn't seem that there is an easy way to modify the Launchpad DB. If either works you could always uninstall after.\n\nhttp://launchpadmanager.com/\nHas a pay version but seems the free version should do what you need.\n\nOr\n\nhttp://horizon-nigh.org/launchpad-editor.html\nA bit more utilitarian but seems to be free as well.\n\n", "Q: Using dd on video DVDs gets permission denied after about 700MB I bought three movies on DVD on eBay. I am trying to make .iso backups onto my external hard drive. The first one I tried using Disk Utility, but it only produced a partial copy (without generating any errors) so I switched to using dd, which worked on the first movie. For both the second and third movie, dd only partially ran through before giving the following error:\ndd: /dev/disk2: Permission denied\n1438432+0 records in\n1438432+0 records out\n736477184 bytes transferred in 212.743197 secs (3461813 bytes/sec)\nThe number of records/bytes is similar, but not exactly the same, for both movies. I have no clue what else to try, since dd is as low-level a program I know to use. I have no idea why the error would be generated mid-copy like that. Googling for this kind of error leads to answers regarding improper filesystem permissions (I'm running sudo dd) and unmounting first (I'm also running sudo umount), and AFAIK neither would lead to dd working for the first 700MB and then getting that error.\nAlso, I have watched these movies all the way through without incident, so the filesystem appears to be good.\n\nA: I've had some success. After trying a number of things unsuccessfully, including uninstalling packages that link into the filesystem, I found something that works reliably: load the disc using any software that reads the content and unlocks the encryption. Even the built-in DVD player works. Now after inserting a disc, I launch the DVD player and let the opening scene play. After that, dd seems to copy just fine.\n\nA: While writing this question, I remembered something I did different with the first disk and think I figured it out. For the second two disks I was using sudo umount /Volumes/DISK_NAME to unmount the DVD before running dd, which generated the permissions error, so I tried sudo umount /dev/diskX. This works, but only once per boot (it would fail again after one successful dd, until I rebooted). But can anyone explain why it worked? I thought the two invocations of umount were equivalent.\n", "Q: Full Screen Video Crashing For the past few weeks my iMac has been crashing when I watch any Flash or Silverlight video in full screen.

It seems very arbitrary when it decides to show and not to show.\nNote: this folder is on a local drive - the default Macintosh HD.\n\n\nA: You might need to re-index the directories on your system by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Spotlight and chose the Privacy tab.\n\n*Drag a directory (or an entire volume) into the list, and confirm the action\n\n*Remove the directory (or volume) from the list via - it, which will trigger a re-index of the directory or volume.\n\n\nSource\n\nA: Here is what worked for me in OS X 10.10.3\n\n\n*\n\n*Open all the images in Preview.app at the same time; drag them all to Preview.app \n\n*With the Preview.app Thumbnails Sidebar (alt command 2) and the Preview.app Inspector window open (command i) use the arrow keys (up/down) to view through all of the images. Each one should be open long enough for you to see the images dimensions in the Inspector window.\n\n*Close Preview.app and now the Finder Preview sidebar will now show the image dimensions.\n", "Q: What's a way to run an automator/bash/applescript command right when a laptop starts charging and right when it stops being charged? I'm trying to automate running a background application only when my laptop is charging to save battery. \nSo it will launch when I plug the laptop in, and quit when I take it out.\n\nA: You can do that very easily using ControlPlane, a free (open-source) application:\n\nControlPlane, a fork of MarcoPolo, brings context and location sensitive awareness to OS X.

Is similar feature available in Linux?\n\nA: The \"@\" means that the file has extended attributes.  You can see them with the xattr command.  The \"1\" is the number of links to that file.  In most cases, for normal files, this will be \"1\".  For directories, it is the number of files/subdirs + 2 (the two actually represents the directory itself, and the parent directory).\n", "Q: How do I make automator only perform an operation on one file at a time? I have with 'Folder Action' that automatically runs a Photoshop script on each file that is added to the folder.\nThe folder action has two steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open this file with Adobe Photoshop CC\n\n*Run the following AppleScript:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    tell application \"Adobe Photoshop CC\"\n        do action \"frame for print\" from \"Zak's actions\"\n    end tell\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nThis folder action works fine when only one item is added to the folder at a time, but if multiple items are added, the folder action fires on each of the new files almost instantaneously so they all open in Photoshop but the Photoshop action only runs on the most recently opened file. (I'm assuming that is because each time the Photoshop action is started it halts the execution of the previous instance)\nI tried adding a pause after the AppleScript hoping that Automator was just thinking that the folder action was done after the AppleScript fired without waiting for it to finish, but even with the pause the folder action was activated for all new files at the same time.\nIs there a way to make sure my folder action only runs on one file at a time and waits for the AppleScript to execute before moving onto the next file?\n\nA: You can do this multilpe ways, one is to use applescript to do a 'for each' loop.\nTake this applescript code snippet as an example and work it out from there.\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n   repeat with an_item in these_items\n       tell application \"Adobe Photoshop CC\"\n           activate\n           open an_item\n           do action \"frame for print\" from \"Zak's actions\"\n       end tell\n   end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\n", "Q: OmniGraffle: change characters spacing for text to occupy surrounding rectangle how? Is there a simple command in OmniGraffle 6.0 x for (a) stretching the character spaces or (b) increasing font size of a word inside a rectangle (enlarge their distances) such that the word fills the entire rectangle nicely? \nI would like to achieve an effect of the following kind: a square split into equal upper and lower rectangles; shorter word (e.g. \"one\") in upper, longer word (e.g. \"four\") in lower rectangle; words should align at their left and right margins and character spacings and/or font sizes should should remain even.\n\nA: Not sure about OmniGraffle 6.x, but in the most recent version (7.18.5 at the time of this writing), you can accomplish this, although it's not quite as automatic as it could be.\nIf I'm interpreting the split square you describe above correctly and if we make it 100 px × 100 px, it should look something like this:\n\nSelect the top rectangle and, in the Font and Text Position inspectors, change the settings as follows:\n\nSelect the bottom rectangle and do the same, except change 21 to 13.\nThose changes will get you this:\n\nThe most important points here are:\n\n*\n\n*Uncheck Auto-Kern (kerning = space between letters).\n\n*Increase the kerning until the text goes where you want it to. Kerning of 21 and 13, respectively, worked for the two rectangles in this case.\n\n*Change the other settings to fill the space. Kerning in OmniGraffle increases the space after each character, and the other settings serve to make sure it fills the entire space without breaking, etc.\n\nTo make this scalable (or as scalable as you can get it), select the rectangles and, in the Geometry selector, select Scale Font or Scale Stoke and Font (if you also want to scale the stroke):\n\nUnfortunately kerning does not scale with this, so you'll need to adjust the kerning manually each time you scale. For example, in the 80 px × 80 px scaled-down version in the image below, I had to reduce kerning in the rectangles to 17 and 10, respectively.\n\n", "Q: The time using 'Set date and time automatically' differs between OS X and iOS On my OS X Mavericks my time is always a few minutes (about 4 minutes) ahead of my iOS 7.1.2 iPhone.

It has 4GB of memory and a 500 GB sata hard drive (5400 rpm).\nWith this specification, if I have to update one and only one part of my machine, which of the following gives me better improvement of performance: 8 GB of ram vs. 256 GB solid state drive?\nThere is a similar question here, but it is not applicable to me since the OP is already having 8GB of ram.\nI know that ssd improves the boot and wake up time as well as data transfer rate, however, I suspect that with 4GB one bottleneck in my machine is page swamping. Thus, accruing more memory would make sense.\nOn the other hand, I read everywhere that ssd makes the computer much more responsive and this is the main reason I want an upgrade.\nTo add to dilemma, my laptop has sata2 while most solid state drives can shine with sata3 (correct me if this wrong).\nSo here is the situation. If you had my mac, would you upgrade the ram or the hard disk?\nP.S. If I go with ssd, I would remove the optical drive and use its physical space for my current hard drive. Running out of space is not really an issue then.\nP.P.S As a side note, if I somehow manage to do both upgrades, i.e. 8 GB of ram and solid state drive. In such case how long would I expand life time of my mac?\nEdit\nI use this mac for coding (and compiling of course) when I'm not on my linux machine. This also means, sometimes I need to run virtual machines (RAM!). Sometimes I also do photos post-processing which includes using huge raw files. Apart from that, mostly regular daily use of surfing, emailing, reading and writing papers.\n\nA: I used to work with a 2009 MBP 13\" with C2D 2.53Ghz, 8GB ram and 256GB SSD, it worked like a charm with development (Qt, XCode), VM (VirtualBox), image edition (lightroom).\nI changed it because the screen was too small but that shouldn't be an issue for you since you're running on a 17\". So if you change both, you can hope at least 2 more years.\nI would go for the SSD which is awesome : your HDD should reach around 100MB/s in RW whereas the SSD can go up to 375MB/s in SATA2 which is very nice. You'll get more speed in loading softwares, and swapping will be faster in order to compensate the eventual lack of RAM. \n\nA: I have a 2011 MacBook Pro 15\", and upgraded it both to 8GB and an SSD. Both upgrades are extremely valuable. \nSince you are using the MBP for coding, I would definitely go for the 8GB. XCode et al. can use quite a lot of RAM.\nThe SSD will also refresh your MBP immensely! Compiling will be much, much faster. As will be application startup times. Especially iPhoto, Aperture and the like will be incredibly faster, if the photo library resides on the SSD.\nSince Apple is shipping most Macs with 8GB still, I guess this will prolong the work life of your Mac for several more years.\n\nA: On the other hand, I use an old 2010 Core 2 11\" MacBook Air with a measly 2 GB of RAM, and it's quick enough to handle Xcode because it has an SSD.  I'd say put the money on the SSD now and make sure your swapfile is going there.\n\nA: I can't see the speed of your processor being very relevant to whether the laptop continues to be compatible with future versions of OS X. I sold a 2008 MBP to a friend that only had 4 GB of RAM as well and a 7200 rpm HDD and it can handle Mavericks just fine. It has a Core2 Duo, with an i7 you should be set for at least 3 more years, if not 6.\nI hope that you upgraded your OS to Mavericks. It helps make the most of either upgrade. \nIf it were my laptop, I would probably go for the RAM. I don't know if I can give a compelling reason for that; it's just something that seems logical to me. \nThat said, I have a MacBook Air with 8 GB of RAM and an SSD and it rarely uses that much of it's RAM—perhaps 6 GB on a busy day, and that's because mavericks utilizes more RAM than necessary when it can for the speed boost. The logic behind Mavericks though, as I understand it, is that it compresses items in your RAM to boost how much is available, so with 4 GB you might get the performance of 6. With 8 GB and the work I do (some computation and coding but also just a lot of tabs and PDFs), I usually get the performance of 6 or 7 GB as well, because it doesn't seem to need that much. So... The SSD might be the better choice, especially because it will speed up your paging a lot. \n", "Q: Mac showing Thunderbolt Ethernet as Airport My network interfaces are showing different names to others that I have seen and I believe it may be causing an issue when setting up a virtual box.\nIsn't Airport the other name for the Wifi? This shows it as the ethernet port.\nHas anyone seen this issue before? I think it may have happened because I installed Android File Transfer or plugged in my Galaxy S4.\n\n\nA: Are you sure someone isn't playing a joke on you?\nJust rename the service. Click the ⚙ icon...\n\nThen rename the server. You can call \"Thunderbolt Ethernet\" something like \"Wi-Fi\", \"Yo Mama\" or anything you wish. You'll also want to change the name of the inactive \"Wi-Fi\" entry to \"Thunderbolt Ethernet\".

Sometimes, when I have many applications open doing many memory and IO-intensive things, my computer inevitably starts to thrash a bit.  While waiting for things to settle down, I often decide to close some applications that don't really need to be open.  The trouble is that many of the applications (especially ones that have background/idle processes) tend to be intermittently unresponsive until the thrashing subsides, so it either takes a very long time for them to get focus to send ⌘+q, or when I go to close them by clicking on their icon in the dock I am only presented with the option to force quit.  I know that those applications aren't permanently unresponsive, so I'd prefer to send them a gentle TERM signal and have them quit gracefully when they are able.  I usually end up killing them by using pkill from the terminal, however, that's not always feasible, especially if the terminal is also hosed.\nWhat is the easiest way to gently send the signal to kill a process if/when that process is intermittently unresponsive?  (In a situation in which access to the terminal and/or starting a new application is not convenient.)\n\nA: You should be able to use AppleScript:\ntell application \"name\" to quit\n\nUsing 'to quit' rather than 'to force quit' will mean that it won't be forced regardless of whether the app is unresponsive—rather, it will ask the app to quit whenever it can.\nWith shell:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"name\" to quit'\n\n", "Q: Send text messages to iphone by email I'm looking for a cheap hack to text myself alerts whenever my server is down.

In the early days of PCs it could kill a machine through drive corruption but Macs have always been relatively robust. Theoretically it is not ideal but I have never had a problem. Startup can be quite slow after such a restart as I suspect there is disk checking etc. going on during the restart.

Upon further examination, it also appears that when I click on the desktop, finder does not become the active application, clicking the desktop does nothing. It is as though the desktop has ceased to have functionality other then displaying an image.\nAny idea how to correct this?\n\nA: I believe that CreateDesktop is set to false. Try running defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool YES in Terminal (unless you are on Mountain Lion or below, in which case the command is defaults write com.apple.Finder CreateDesktop -bool YES), followed by killall Finder. You should be able to view items on and drag items to your Desktop now, including drives.\n\nA: If these kind of Finder problems are user specific, you can fix them by removing your Finder preference files in your Library.\nThe files you want to delete (backup) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\n\n*com.apple.finder.plist\n\n\nYou can find them in ~/Library/Preferences/ (Home -> Library -> Preferences).\nGo to Finder, press commandshiftG and paste ~/Library/Preferences/\nNow you need to relaunch Finder (logout/login, or reboot, or commandaltesc)\n\nA: This perhaps won't fix your bounty issue, but for Finder not correctly coming to the front... \nOpt-right click the Finder icon in the dock > Relaunch [bottom menu item] Should fix focussing issues with no side effects.

Or is there any official policy which could be construed this way?\n\nA: There's nothing specific in the App Review Guidelines regarding this, although Apple reserve the right to reject your app and/or modify the guidelines:\n\nIt is a living document that will evolve as we are presented with new Apps and situations, and we'll update it periodically to reflect these changes.\n\nSource: App Store Review Guidelines\n\nA: It would be considered \"deceiving\" and probably not allowed.\nIt will be left to interpretation (by Apple), if such pop up is deceiving (witch it is) and what is its the ultimate purpose, since it is possible that some users would react rather negatively until they realize it was a joke.\nIf you app is some kind of game in that nature, then yes, but if it is some kind of board game, then no.\n\n22.2\nApps that contain false, fraudulent or misleading representations or\n  use names or icons similar to other Apps will be rejected.\n\nSource: https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html\n", "Q: Can I migrate all data from my MacBook to my iMac How can I migrate all data from my MacBook to my iMac without losing it from the Macbook?\n\nA: Goto Application > Utilities > Migration Assistant on both the devices, they should be either on the same wifi network, or connected physically with a Cable like thunderbolt, Ethernet etc. It will guide you to transfer the data.\n", "Q: Is there any way to programatically remap the keys in a Macbook running OSX Mavericks? I want to remap the keys on my keyboard. I want to do it programatically, because I will use some logic to decide what to input.

In other words, everytime I type a key on my keyboard, I want to intercept it, apply some logic to it and give it back changed before it goes to the focused app.\nHow?\n\nA: Have you looked into Keyboard Maestro?  I use it all the time,  I believe you can accomplish with what you want using Keyboard Maestro.\nFor example:  You can have it check for a typed in string \"good\" and return morning or afternoon based on the time of day.\n\nWith Keyboard Maestro you can execute AppleScript or Shell scripts.  Keyboard Maestro is pretty powerful.   Your macros can then be global or specific to an application.\n\nA: Most of the text macro tools available on the Mac will be able to trigger scripts (Applescript, shell scripts, etc.) as well as perform standard expansions based on the input and context. \nI like to start my expansions with the semi-colon since I know I will rarely accidentally trigger an expansion in my normal typing, and it's an easy key to hit.\nFor instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I type \";check\", it automatically expands to \"✓\" \n\n*;yen → ¥ \n\n*;dt → 2014-07-11 (current date)\n\n*;email → expands to my email address\n\n*etc. \n\n\nThese expansions can also call scripts rather than basic substitutions to perform more advanced functions if you'd like. Some popular software options for this are aText, Typinator and TextExpander among many others.\n\nA: The answers that others have given are probably the way you want to do this, but if you really wanted to intercept and inject keystrokes, check out how Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) does it. \nHere's the interesting bit: https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/tree/master/src/core/kext\nIt would be pretty involved to adapt their code and do what you want, but it's certainly possible.\n\nA: Another option is to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/, save\n{\n  \"a\" = {\n    \"s\" = (insertText:, \"λ\");\n  };\n}\n\nas ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict, and quit and reopen applications to apply changes.\nThat prevents you from inserting a, but you might replace a with another key combination like ~a (option-a) or \\Uf704 (F1).\n", "Q: How can I \"Delete All\" from Inbox or Sent mail folder in iOS?

However, if this was merely related to re-indexing then one would expect things to go back to normal but this doesn't seem to be the case.\nBasically, now everything (related to podcasts, at least) takes about 100 times longer than it should take. For instance, after clicking on the podcasts tab itself, it takes 10 seconds (with CPU at 100%) and just refreshing podcasts has taken up to 30 minutes.\n\nSince updating iTunes to Version 11.3, it quickly takes up 100% of the CPU and stops responding every time I try to open it.\nI've tried:\n\n*\n\n*Waiting for it to sort itself out on its own\n\n*Force Quitting (and then re-starting iTunes)\n\n*Re-starting my computer entirely (MBP, running Version 10.9.4) and then trying both previous approaches.\n\nHas anyone heard of this issue before? Should I uninstall 11.3? And, if so, how do I do this?\nAgain, this problem has only started happening since updating to Version 11.3 two days ago.\nAnother strange thing is that iTunes does not appear to be totally frozen--for a few seconds the \"(not responding)\" will occasionally disappear and then reappear. Plus, in those few seconds that it starts to respond again, its status will change (for instance, now it says it is \"Processing Album Artwork\" and earlier a random podcast started playing). However, this doesn't seem to explain why the % CPU consistently remains at around 100%. [UPDATE: The 100% CPU/\"Not Responding\"-status may, for some reason, be related to podcasts being refreshed]\nCurrently, the only Applications I have open are:\n\n*\n\n*Activity Monitor\n\n*Google Chrome\n\n*iTunes\n\n*Finder\n\n\nA: Since upgrading to iTunes 11.3 I have experienced a very similar problem.  Every time I refresh my podcasts, iTunes' memory/CPU usage surges, and the iTunes UI freezes up for 5-10 minutes.\nI haven't found a complete solution, but I have stumbled across a temporary workaround.  On my system, the problem only seems to occur when I refresh podcasts while looking at them in the List view, as in the screenshot below:\n\nIf instead I refresh podcasts from the All Unplayed view, there is no freezing at all:\n\nIt appears that the issue is related to viewing the podcast list while refreshing all podcasts.  (You can even avoid the issue if you click refresh in List view and then quickly click away to another view, like Music.)\nNot a super satisfying answer, I know, but for me it has returned iTunes to a semi-usable state.\n\nA: Maybe you can try to restart your computer.

Any help would be greatful as I think the only option\nI have left is take out the hard drive in the imac and replace with another new drive I have.\n\nA: This question is a year old but I am going to answer it incase someone else runs into this same issue.  \nI just bought a mid 2011 27\" refurb iMac from IBM and they scrubbed the HD completely.  This eliminated pretty much every option there was for installing an OS on the Mac.  \nThe problem is that when these models shipped they had either Lion (10.7) or at the earliest Snow Leopard 10.6.6.  They are not backwards compatible with the Snow Leopard retail DVDs Apple offers, which is OS X 10.6.3.  These iMacs originally shipped with installion DVDs but Apple would not send them to me.\nHere's what I had to do:\nDownload/or otherwise obtain an OS X 10.6.7.iso file from wherever you might find something like that.  It will be an disk image for a DVD not intended for this model of iMac, and it will not work.  \nI bought the retail DVDs (10.6.3) from Apple, and they did not work.  I got a RAM Error message (three tones) at boot.  \nIf you have both you can splice the installer package files from the retail DVDs (which work with any Mac) with the installer package files from the 10.6.7 disk image and create a \"universal\" OS X 10.6.7 installer disk image.  This is not fancy it's a simple matter of copy and paste.  Detailed instructions for this process can be found here.\nAfter I had the modified .iso file I converted it into a .dmg using this terminal code.  Again, very simple.  Nothing to be afraid of.\nFrom there I used \"Carbon Copy Cloner\" and Cloned the .dmg file I created through this process unto a thumb drive (needs to be at least 8gb).  Worked like a charm.  Just pup it in a usb port and turn on the iMac.\nYou can also (possibly) use Disk Utility which is a built in utility and \"restore\" the image to your thumb drive, but I wasn't having any luck with my Disk Utility boot disks and so I decided to try another utility.  My feeling is that it likely would have worked this way if i had used DU.  \nMake sure your thumb is formatted for GUID.  Just a word of caution. I intend to upgrade to Yosemite.  The install of Snow Leopard works, but I don't fully trust it and my Airport card is non functional.  Certain things went wrong in the installation process obviously, but it's good enough to boot, and then upgrade, or maybe try to install a fresh unaltered version of Snow Leopard if that's your desire.  \nI hope this helps someone out.  I've tried dozens of different ways to just get this iMac to boot an OS and this is finally the one that worked.  Apple Support was zero help.

I'm a web developer using a MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9.3.\nBefore I started developing in a Mac, I used Cygwin on a Windows machine to see what was happening behind the scene on my web application. I had a Logging system built in PHP which created log files with all the content of the variables I wanted to debug.  \nBasically, this Logging system creates another PHP file with all the debug needed and through Cygwin, every time I refreshed my web application in the browser it would refresh itself synchronously and outputted a new print with all my recent code updates.\nI've searched everywhere but didn't find any close solution.\nThe one I'm using right now is using the terminal and writhing:\ncat /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/BO_V2/data/logs/log-2014-07-10.php \n\nBut it is not automatic and I have to press ↑+enter every time I want to see what the log file has to show.\nOn OS X, is there a way to have Terminal or another application refresh the print from my log file every time I refresh my browser window (Chrome, Firefox or Safari)?\n\nA: Assuming it's the same as on Linux, you could also use:\nless /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/BO_V2/data/logs/log-2014-07-10.php\n\nThen press Shift+F to have it tail automatically, or just Shift+G to go to the end of file.\n\nA: *\n\n*On windows, the Cygwin is a Unix-like environment.\n\n*OS X (now macOS) is full on UNIX, so there is no need for any additions to get these unix tools. \n\n\nOpen Terminal.app and start with manual pages.\nThe more and tail -f commands are typical unix commands to page, search, and watch a log file.\nFor your example, the tail command to watch your log file is:\ntail -f /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/BO_V2/data/logs/log-2014-07-10.php\n\n", "Q: App that allows iPhones to share information while overseas without a plan (and no data) I need an app that allows a number of iPhones to exchange information between each other during an event that there may be no WiFi available while myself and two buddies travel overseas. \nNone of us plan on 'roaming' while overseas on our current plan, we strictly plan to either stick together, or communicate through wifi.

It came down to zero free space and I couldn't do anything except force-shutdown it. I booted into Windows, deleted some files from OSX drive, but now on boot there is a progress bar every time and when it reaches the end (in 15 min), the computer shuts down.\nI went into the recovery mode and tried to repair the disk, but it says \"The Disk Utility cannot repair the drive... backup files and reinstall the OS\" -- something like that.\nI have a time machine backup but I'm currently not at home - going home in 3 weeks.\nIs it \"normal\" that system gets borked like this because of full disk + force shutdown? Seems too fragile to me. I have Mavericks 10.9.4 on this system.\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nA: The problem is that the system goes into a fail-safe mode when the directory structure cannot be presumed to be safe for a new write.\nYou did the correct triage step by booting into recovery mode and attempting to repair the volume with Disk Utility.\nAt this point, you should back up any files you need. Test that your backup is complete and run Disk Utility against it to make sure it's in a good state.\nThen you can boot to recovery and erase the volume or perhaps use another tool to repair the volume. If the drive erases and takes a format - the problem was a directory (data) corruption and not a hardware issue. If the disk can't be erased, then you need to repair the machine before restoring your backup onto a clean install of the OS.\nIn your case, you could possibly back up the changed files since 3 weeks or just get a new external drive and use Disk Utility to clone the volume or terminal to copy what you can using rsync or another tool.\n\nA: Actually Mavericks since 10.9.3 has had a filesystem bug where files are not deleted properly, thus the disk \"fills up\" with files that don't exist, and then when you try and repair it it fails the first time, but may work if you try again.\n\nA: I used Disk Warrior and it fixed the problem.\n", "Q: 1TB ssd in late 2013 rMBP 2.4 i5 I bought a 13\" MacBook Pro with Retina display (Late 2013, 2.4GHz i5), and it only has 128GB storage.

NOT volume control I'm often victim to some loud sound playing on my computer all of a sudden when I have my volume level turned up already to watch a quiet video. I can't turn everything down to the level of the quietest video I will ever watch; that's impractical. I can't even control the volume level of some applications.\nIs there an audio proxy or some other plugin that can limit how loudly a sound will be outputted from my built-in audio card? I'd like an audio output level limit control in addition to the system volume control. For example, if I have my volume up all the way to watch a quiet video, any loud sound that plays should sound as if my volume is set to half or something. I've got my Mac connected to external speakers with an analog 1/8\" cable.\n\nA: For a free solution to add a compressor/limiter to the system-wide audio, you can use Soundflower along with Apple's AU Lab:\nhttps://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases\nhttps://www.apple.com/itunes/mastered-for-itunes/\nFollowing these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Soundflower and AU Lab.\n\n*Open System Preferences > Sound, and set both the Sound Effects and the Output to play through Soundflower (2ch).\n\n*Open AU Lab, and in the Document Configuration window, under Factory Configurations, select Stereo In/Stereo Out.\n\n*Set the Input to Soundflower (2ch), and the output to Built-in Output.\n\n*Click Create Document.\n\n*In the Output 1 channel strip under Effects, select Apple > AUDynamicsProcessor.\n\n*Adjust the settings in the Dynamics Processor window as desired.\n\n\nA similar setup using the AUDynamicsProcessor is possible with the commercial Audio Hijack:\nhttps://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/\nThe Hear app also has a limiter, and seems to use less CPU resources than the above. However, it's no longer in developoment and has limited support:\nhttps://www.prosofteng.com/download/?hearmac\nWhile these are answers to the question of how to add a compressor/limiter to the overall system audio, there are some drawbacks. One is that the above solutions may use significant CPU resources. Another is that you'll most likely need to remember to turn it on and off when watching a movie. Otherwise, having the compressor on all the time may reduce the overall dynamic range and sound quality of your computer, for example when playing music.\nRather than compressing or limiting the overall system audio, another approach is to compress then boost the quiet parts of movies so that you don't have to turn up the volume level on your speakers. I use mpv ( https://mpv.io ) to play video, which has several options for precise dynamics control including the \"lavfi compander\" or the \"acompressor.lua\" script, with very little impact on CPU usage. VLC also has a built-in compressor found in Preferences (Show all) Audio > Filters > Compressor.\nAudio Hijack can be used to route the audio of an app that has no native compression options through dynamics processing. There are also other options with Audio Hijack, such as routing your movie's audio to external speakers, while routing everything else to internal speakers with a separate volume control.\n\nA: It sounds like you're looking to essentially accomplish something like real-time 'Dynamic Audio Normalization'.\nIn order to accomplish this, as answered above, all incoming audio has to be sampled and processed continuously. It can be CPU intensive and/or cause slight delays/glitches in your audio output. \"Real-time\" audio processing is quite challenging.\nWhile it doesn't normalize the volume, Volume Limiter for Mac, available on the AppStore as well as website does limit the volume. (The web version offers a free trial). It has advanced capabilities, including limiting by audio device, which may be a helpful alternative.\n\nA: Sonarworks Systemwide, it's not free. \n", "Q: Look up in dictionary Is there a way to bind the chrome style look up in dictionary to a key binding?

Because when the mac is restarted, I can hear the start-up chime. So I know the audio does in fact work. Alternatively, I can plug up some headphones to the jack and it works fine.

No luck.\nAnyone have any suggestions before I buy a replacement logic board off eBay and replace it?\nI love having a 17-inch MBP and do not want to downgrade to a new 15.\n\nA: The red light in your audio out jack indicates that it is active. That is why you do not hear anything on the speakers.\nYour analog/digital switch in the port is stuck -- the red light is the digital audio signal.\nTry to plug the headphone in, this time wiggling it from side to side while it's plugged in. \nAlternatively try cleaning the audio plug:\nTry inserting a cocktail stirrer or a toothpick and jiggle it around in the audio output port and the internal speakers should come to life.  \nIf you have a compressed air can use it. that seems to work best.\nThere is a switch inside that has to be tripped. \n\nA: Ruskes' answers above work for probably a majority of people with this problem, but if you're like me, and those fixes stop working after a while or don't work at all, it's possible to actually break the circuit that erroneously switches you to the Digital Output and prevent it from activating, leaving you with headphones and speakers and normal.\nThe solution, which originally comes from stin17 on this MacRumors thread, is intimidating but uncomplicated. We simply want to interrupt the line between the audio codec IC on the logic board and the little switch in the headphone jack by removing a component in between. This is usually a small resistor on older models, and after the Retina MBPs I believe it is an inductor.\nIf you can correctly identify your logic board model number (physically located on the logic board itself, usually a 6- or 7-digit number; for example, my 2012 MBP with a 2.3GHz i7 is a model A1286 and board number 820-3330-B) and find the boardview and schematic, you'll be able to find a resistor in line with the digital output switch, which, when removed, will prevent the audio codec IC from reading the digital switch. This permanently disables the optical digital/TOSLINK audio output, and you should not do this unless you are certain you've found the right resistor! However, if you're sure you know which components you're looking at, it takes about 10 seconds to scrape the tiny surface-mount resistor off the logic board with an x-acto knife.\nIf you have an A1286 macbook, it is likely R6805, which you can find in schematics and boardviews; this part number will certainly be different on other models. On my logic board, the circuit we want to interrupt is labeled AUD_PORTB_DET_L. Later models, after Retina I believe seem to rename this circuit to AUD_CONN_TIPDET_1 or AUD_CONN_TIPDET_2; I'd guess TIPDET_1 is headphone detection and TIPDET_2 is TOSLINK detection, but I'm not positive since I don't have one of those boards to check. Make sure you double check these on your particular model! I can't guarantee that R6805 is the one to get, but that's a good place to start.\nThe result here is that the digital switch inside the headphone jack remains physically stuck, but it no longer matters as it cannot complete its circuit to erroneously tell the audio IC that there is a TOSLINK plug in the jack. Again, optical digital audio output over TOSLINK does not work after doing this, unless you replace the resistor and go back to the current \"digital out\" problem, but it sounds like you don't need optical digital audio output. This is straightforward and familiar for some, for others it's new and terrifying! I started learning my way around schematics and boardviews because of this exact problem. If you feel up to the task and you don't need TOSLINK audio output from your headphone jack, this is the most reliable and elegant fix when the other temporary methods fail.\n", "Q: /opt directory doesn't exist on OS X 10.9 Just received my macbook air and discover that i can't run port command because of /opt directory not exists. Is it normal? (OS X 10.9)\n\nA: Yes, OS X does not come with anything in /opt or even the directory itself. I presume you're looking for MacPorts, which is a 3rd-party package manager that installs port. MacPorts has to be installed separately.\nVarious other apps can place files in /opt though.

Normally I receive mail shortly after it was sent, but on occasion Outlook will refuse to check my mail for periods ranging from minutes to hours. \nBy \"refuse to check my mail\" I mean that:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I click the \"send/receive\" button, the button responds with a click animation, but it does not check my mail.\n\n*If I open the \"progress\" window (cmd-7) I can confirm that no activity is shown. \n\n*No error messages appear in the \"errors\" window (cmd-8). \n\n\nDuring these times:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can log in to webmail and confirm that there are messages that haven't been downloaded. \n\n*My mac has full connectivity otherwise\n\n*Outlook is able to send emails, which are received by others right away (but my sent mail box isn't updated either). \n\n*The status message in the lower-right still says \"connected to [account name]\" and accurately displays the last time it connected to the server. \n\n\nThe problem sometimes resolves spontaneously, and I'll get a bunch of old mail at once.\nQuitting and restarting usually fixes the problem. But that requires me to notice that it's happening, which sometimes doesn't happen for several hours, during which I can miss emails that required an immediate response. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions or diagnostic steps? \n\nA: I have experienced the same issue with Apple Mail since updating to Mavericks.  I was hoping Outlook would be better, but it sounds like it has the same problem.\nMy understanding is that this occurs occasionally when checking mail hosted via Kerio or Exchange.  My workaround is to use Thunderbird, which has not had the problem.  I actually have Thunderbird running simultaneously just for the alerts, and if there is an alert but Mail hasn't received new mail, I know to quit and restart.  \n", "Q: Do I need \"Install OS X Mavericks\" after I've upgraded? I have \"Install OS X Mavericks\" in my Applications folder even though I installed it a while ago. Does the system require this for utilities or something, or is there any reason to keep it around?\n\nA: No. If you have no use for it, delete it. The OS doesn't need it any more and if you want to reinstall OS X you can use the Recovery HD, so there's generally no need to keep it.\nThe post-install script will even delete it for you if its found in the default location as far as I know, but if you still have it there's no problem deleting it yourself.\n", "Q: Do I have the latest firmware update for my Time Capsule? How can I force an upgrade of the firmware? \nI am running the latest Maverick. Does anyone know how can I force an upgrade of my firmware?\n\nA: If AirPort Utility doesn't prompt you that an update is available, then you have the latest version installed on the Time Capsule.\n\nHow do I know when an update is available?\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*AirPort Utility automatically checks for updates once a week (even if it's not open), then notifies you if an update is available.\n  \n*When you open AirPort Utility, it will check for updates and display a badge by the name of any AirPort device in your network that has an available firmware update.\n  \n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1218\n\nA: The Airport Utility.app and the Time Capsule utilize separate application and firmware versions.\nAirport Utlility.app is updated via Software Update on your Mac.  As grgarside mentioned above, when you launch Airport Utility.app and connect to a Airport Extreme, Airport Express, or Time Capsule, it automatically checks to see if it is running the latest firmware.  Based on your screenshot, you have an Airport Time Capsule with 802.11n.  I'd look here to determine your specific marketing model number.  From there, I'd Google \" firmware\" to clarify, however I'm almost positive your Time Capsule is on the latest firmware.\n", "Q: All my Time Machine windows are black \nThat was supposed to be my finder window with my backups over time but I only see black screens. :(\n\nA: Go to Finder and select your Time Capsule in the Shared list in the sidebar.

I'm feeling a little tearful here.  I accidentally neglected to back up properly and Time Machine deleted older backups that contained all my sons photos from infancy.  Is there any at all to recover these?  Thank you so much. \n\nA: I'm sorry to say that I don't believe there is a way to get those photos back. The way Time Machine works is, it will make backups of the current state of your computer, and continue doing so until space on the backup hard drive runs out. At that point, once your backup hard drive no longer has space, it begins to delete backups (oldest first) to make room for new ones.\nWhen deleting something from a hard drive, if you immediately stop using that drive, there's some hope of getting it back since no other files have been written over where the old files were. But if Time Machine deleted old backups to make room for new ones, my guess is that they're unfortunately gone.\nTime Machine SHOULD have asked you, at some point, if you were OK with it deleting old backups to make room for new ones. If you declined, it would simply stop backing up your computer until you freed up some room on the drive. If you accepted, you gave Time Machine free reign over the hard drive (which is what most people do).\n", "Q: Download app on someone else's device? If I sign into someone's ipod to download something, using my ID & password and forget to logout, will I be able to locate the device using Find My iphone?\n\nA: Not unless your Apple ID has been logged in for use with Find My iPhone. Chances are this hasn't happened, since the iPod can only be associated with a single Apple ID  at a time for the purposes of device registration and Find my iPhone.\n\nA: No, unless you logged into find my iphone with the apple ID\n", "Q: How to merge two Mac partitions? Recently I ran Boot Camp Assistant to install a copy of Windows 7. The \"Partitioning Disk\" process froze and I force quit it - I know, bad idea - and although I was left with a functioning Mac, I noticed that the Mac is split into two separate partitions. One is 2.2 TB, and one is 801.44 GB (I have a 3 TB Fusion Drive). Previously they showed up as one single partition. When I launch Disk Utility, either from Utilities or Internet Recovery Mode, I get \"The full size of the Fusion Drive is not available for repartitioning.\", and I'm unable to delete/adjust either of the partitions (all the options are greyed out).\nI have Time Machine and I have a separate HD backup, so I don't mind reinstalling OS X - in fact, I want to - but I want to fix the Mac hard drive so that everything appears as one cohesive partition, but I'm not sure what to do.\nI found this site - http://www.rawkode.com/blog/2014/2/12/osx-fusion-drive-boot-camp-assistant-disk-utility-recovery - which seems to do what I want to do, but I'm hesitant on using \"deleteVolume\".

Also repair disk and permissions.\nFrom the screenshot I noticed that you selected your boot disk, which is not possible to edit while OS is running, however second split of HD should be editable. To make less confusion, consider renaming HD, for potential data prevention while modifying HD\n\nA: If you can boot from an alternative startup disk then, you could format the drive with the partitions at the top level (not down in the individual partitions).\nWhich would then enable you to install your new operating system to it.\n\nThe alternative startup disk could be a netboot or a different disk of any type (thumb, ssd, 2ndary HD, cd, dvd… whatever; which has a disk utility…)\n", "Q: Remove Eject Icon from Menu bar ￼How do I get rid of this icon? \nI'm not even sure what it's for.\nIt's possible that it's for remote CD Drive, but I don't remember how I got it up there in the first place.\nDetails:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac 27 inch late 2012\n\n*OS X Mavericks\n\n\n\n\nA: The Eject menu is part of the Menu Extras that are of the standard core service items for the Mac.\nIt is not normally enabled.\nBut one way of enabling it is to double click on the \n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu  file.\nThe Eject menu is normally for your built in disc drive if you have one.\n\nIt may or may not work on external disc drive.\nTo remove the Eject Menu\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the Apple/Command key.\n\n*Click and drag the Eject menu icon off the menu bar.\n\n*Once you start dragging the Eject icon, you can release the\nApple/Command key.\n\n*Release the mouse button when the Eject menu no longer appears in the\nmenu bar.\nThe Eject icon will disappear.\n", "Q: How to mirror one folder to another using rsync 3.x? I have compiled rsync 3.0.9 just because the one included in Mavericks is so old.\nAnyway, I am trying to mirror a folder in my main HDD in another HDD.

Thanks a lot :)\n\nA: If you add the itemised \"-i\" or \"--itemize-changes\" option to your command rsync will tell you why it is transferring the files.\nFor each file you'll see a strings that looks like \">f..t......\". The format of the string is \"YXcstpoguax\". Y is the direction of the transfer. X is the type of object being transferred (for example 'f'ile, 'd'irectory). The rest of the string documents the changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*c for checksum\n\n*s for size\n\n*t for modification time\n\n*p for permissions\n\n*o for owner\n\n*g for group\n\n*u is currently reserved for future use\n\n*a for ACL permissions\n\n*x for extended attributes\n\n\nSo in my example above it transferred the file because the modification time was different.\nThis should help you identify why the files are still being transferred.\n", "Q: ITunes is locked I have installed iTunes on my Macbook-pro successfully today. But the display shows that iTunes is installed but locked and cannot be used for writing.

Check that you have write permission to your iTunes library.\n", "Q: How to tie thunderbolt and power together for Macbook retina docking in Thunderbolt display? When docking my Macbook Pro Retina to a Thunderbolt display I need to plug in two cables (a power cable plug, and a thunderbolt cable). I read in a comment that there might be a simple way of clipping the cables together so that they can be plugged into the Macbook in one motion. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a clip that can be purchased that links the power cable and thunderbolt cable together for individual entry?\n\n*Alternatively, is there some simple do-it-yourself option for keeping the cable together and in the one place?\n\n\nA: After a little searching I found a few options\n\n\n*\n\n*The Macbook Pro Dock Cable from Prototype Asia.. This looks like a very cheap clipping option. However, the company or individual selling it seems pretty small-scale.\n\n*ZenDock is a simple docking solution that makes a single left side plug for power and other thuderbolt ports. At time of posting (July 2014), it is only available on pre-order.\n\n*LandingZone 2.0 Pro provides a docking and security solution that allows for one-click entry of power and thunderbolt. \n\n", "Q: How do I enable a British English voice in Google Maps turn-by-turn navigation on iOS? I'm a UK iPhone user. Google Maps turn-by-turn navigation has always used a US English voice for me, even though both Siri and Apple Maps use a British English voice. I was surprised recently to hear British English directions in Google Maps on another user's phone. I've never been able to find a setting to change it, beyond checking my Siri settings, so assumed I was stuck with a US voice.\nHow do I configure Google Maps to use a British English voice and British variant words?\n\nA: There are two steps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change your Siri voice settings to English (United Kingdom) - as of iOS 7.1.2 this is under Settings > General > Siri > Language and also Settings > General > International > Voice Control (they're both the same setting: change one and the other changes too).\n\n*Change your device Language setting to British English: it's under Settings > General > International > Language.\nThat second one was difficult to find because the default option is English - as opposed to English (United States) which always prompts me to check for an English (United Kingdom) version - and the list is not in alphabetical order: British English and Australian English are both there but way down at the bottom. And weirdly, devices bought in the UK come with most settings defaulting to British but not this one.\nYou'll know if your device is set to British English because the Cellular option in Settings becomes Mobile.\nNB: If your device already has these settings and you still get an American accent, try changing the device language to US English, then back to UK English. \n\n", "Q: Different transparency for in-call menu I'm using ios7.1 and I was wondering if there's a way to change the transparency of the in-call menu?\nWhen I use the dialer's keypad I have about 30% transparency (I can see the background but it's mostly covered in white), but when I'm in the middle of a call, the background is about 70-80% transparent, so if I have a light wallpaper, I can't see the menu or the numbers.\nI'm looking for a tweak that will enable me to manually change the transparency or tweak it from iFile.\nSecond option: set a dark wallpaper only for in-call menu (is it possible?)\nThank you!\n\nA: No, this is impossible using official iOS builds.

If you have MacPorts installed, you can install the coreutils port using the command:\nsudo port install coreutils\n\nThis installs the GNU core utilities (including split) with a g prefix, so you call split using the command gsplit.\n", "Q: How to change Macbook Pro (late 2013) screen and top cover I had an crash accident with my MBPro (late 2013). MB fall down and crashed to its top left  corner. There is a damage to unibody (its not so big problem for me, I can live with it) but there is bigger problem because probably damage of Retina display - when I look at a screen with dark background I can see very tinny and randomly distributed shiny white pixels. It is not much visible but I think it might be some bigger problem with display.\nI would like to change the whole top cover. Is it possible to buy this component? Where? Does anybody have some experience with this replacement?\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem with my MacBook (as I bought it in such a condition). I bought the screen from eBay. Its quite easy to fix if you follow the instructions on iFixit. You should consider buying only display, not the whole top assembly, as the prices really different.

I have an old MacBook running OS 10.6.8 which I want to recycle, but its internal SuperDrive doesn't work, so I can't use the install disk to do it.  I tried plugging in Apple's external USB SuperDrive which I bought when I upgraded to a MacBook Pro which has no internal SuperDrive, but the external SuperDrive doesn't accept the disc; it's as if the old MacBook doesn't recognize the external drive.  I'm thus at a loss as to how to proceed to wipe the hard disk.\n\nA: You should try to create a bootable USB stick with some kind of recovery LiveCD (Ubuntu, BackTrack, ...)\nI recommend using Ubuntu because it is the easiest to create.\nThere is a little tutorial on Ubuntu's website: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx \n(If you Have trouble be sure to ask a question on AskUbuntu)\nAfter you have a recovery usb wipe the disk using your favorite tool. I found a nice tutorial on 'How to geek', but it's a bit outdated.\n(Tip: download wipe from the software center, not from synaptic)\n\nA: If your MacBook is capable of upgrading to 10.7 or newer (the current 10.9, OS X Mavericks is available for free from the AppStore, 10.7 - Lion and 10.8 - Mountain Lion are for sale on DVD at the apple online store for under €20,-) you can use the disk utility from the recovery partition (after installing a newer version of OS X, in this case from a bootable USB Drive) by holding cmd + r during boot.\nElse, if you are not afraid to open the MacBook you can also remove the drive, put it in an external enclosure and format it with another machine.\n\nA: I suggest you borrow or purchase an inexpensive external DVD drive to see if you can boot from the install disc. This Sanyo drive is only $28US and works just fine read/write on all the Macs I've attached it to, old and new. I can't guarantee you will be able to boot from it, as I've never tried that, but if it won't boot your laptop you can always send it back for a refund.\n", "Q: How to determine what is intercepting mailto: links and disable the interception to have the default Apple Mail handle the mailto: links At some point way back in the past, I set up some utility to intercept mailto: links in web pages and have Chrome compose a message in Gmail rather than having it open the Apple Mail app.\nNow, I'm trying to remove it and have Apple Mail open mailto: links, but I can't figure out the utility I used to intercept them.\nI thought it might have been Webmailer, but I checked System Preferences, and it's not in there.

Is the normal, default behavior for an CMD-R based Mavericks OS Recovery to always pull the image over the internet?\n(I am not talking about a deliberate \"Internet\" recovery CMD+OPT+R)\nBack story -- I just purchased an open box 2014 Macbook Air.  It was nominally wiped and recovered with os 10.9.3 -- (although I also am pretty sure I am seeing the previous owner's name appearing as default bluetooth options (probably need to PRAM reset as well)).\nIn any case, I immediately booted again with CMD-R to perform a Full OS reinstall.   It immediately let me know installation would take over an hour.  Looking at the full logs, and my wifi logs, it  spends about 15 minutes downloading \"506 chunks\", of what I presume is the recovery image.\nThe first time this happened, I figured it was doing so possibly because there 10.9.4 is now the current OS version, so perhaps it just does a simple check and downloads a new recovery image if the version has changed.   I let it complete the full install by default.\nHowever, for giggles, after it was fully complete with the install (fully default), I decided to perform another OS install.   Interestingly enough, the same behavior, 15 minutes spent downloading the same 506 chunks.\nI would have expected that the recovery image on the disc would be the primary means of recovery, with deltas possibly being downloaded.   The behavior I'm seeing seems very \"wasteful\" OF bandwidth.\nI'm just wondering the the prior owner did something that is permanently causing this behavior.\n\nA: To avoid having to use Internet Recovery make a Mavericks USB installer.\nFirst, download the Mavericks installer from the App Store. This will be placed in your Applications folder. Once downloaded do not run it or move it.\nNext open Disk Utility and erase an 8GB USB memory stick, naming it Untitled. If you name it anything else be sure to modify the command below.\nOpen Terminal and enter the following command-\nsudo /Applications/\"Install OS X Mavericks.app\"/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/\"Install OS X Mavericks.app\" --nointeraction\n\nWhen complete you will have a full standalone installer, no network access required.\n\nA: What you have would be normal if you do not have local copy of recovery.\n\nOS X Internet Recovery\nMac models introduced after public availability of OS X Lion include\n  the ability to start up directly from an Internet-based version of the\n  OS X Recovery system. OS X automatically uses this feature when the\n  Recovery System on the hard disk isn't available (such as when your\n  hard disk encounters an issue, or when your hard disk has been\n  replaced or erased).

Some sharing panels offer a \"Open  In...\" option in the bottom-right corner. If you check an application that does offer this option (for example Dropbox) you'll likely find Instagram in that list.\nFor some reason Apple doesn't provide that \"Open In...\" option in the Camera or Photos apps.\nThe Facebook and Flickr options are hard-coded by Apple. They always appear in the sharing list even if you don't have the applications installed.\n\nA: It might be easier to try opening Instagram first and then picking out the picture from your photo gallery. If the picture you're trying to share isn't in your gallery, you can take a screenshot of it in order for it to appear in your gallery. From there you will be able to upload the picture to Instagram. Hope this helps :)\n\nA: There is no way to share it straight from the photo gallery as of iOS 7. It is much easier to share it straight from the instagram app.  You can simply do so by pressing the bright blue camera photo on the bottom of the screen in instagram. You will then be directed to some filters you can choose.\n\nIf it still does not work, try quit the instagram app through multitasking and re enter the app.\n \n It might be possible to share straight form the photos app in iOS 8 or you could (not recommended) jail break to get it.\n\nA: Since Instagram developers do not provide a share extension, this is not possible. \nYou can, however work around this using the Workflow application using a simple workflow that takes an image and passes it to Post to Instagram action. \n\nA: The app may have been rerouted to another directory not visible to the parameters of your iPhone's camera roll. Try reinstalling instagram and check its properties. It should work fine the next time around.\n\nA: Access the photo from Instagram, and if you're like me, you won't see the \"channel\" in this case, Instagram to share the photo to, BUT it doesn't matter as you are accessing the photo FROM Instagram, so add text if you want and select post (while ignoring the fact that you haven't selected one of the default channels), and it WILL post to Instagram.  I just verified this.\n\nA: Simply open your Instagram app, tap the center \"camera\" icon (the square with a circle in the middle) your photo library from your iPhone will appear at the bottom of your screen and you can \"select\" a photo from there. Then tap the \"next\" word at the upper right of your picture until you are satisfied with any filters or alterations you want to make, then continue to hit \"next\" again and your photo will post to Instagram. \n\nA: Instagram does provide an extension these days, but it doesn't seem to work for any content you try to share. It does work for the Photos app so it is possible that the extension only allows sharing images.\nReference:\nhttp://www.techtimes.com/articles/163568/20160607/instagram-share-extensions-on-ios-perks-and-limitations.htm\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2016/06/06/instagram-share-extension/\nUpdate: I'm also an app developer and was wondering why the share button in my app(s) had Twitter, Facebook etc show up but not Instagram. Turned out if I disabled sharing text and urls and only provided an image to the share action, Instagram would show up as an option. So yes, the sharing extension by Instagram definitely only supports sharing images and will hide if it sees text, urls or other content coming in its way.

I've changed my mind about having Safari/iCloud Keychain never remember my password for a given website. I'd like to remove that setting and store the password, but I can't find any ability to delete/change it anywhere. I've already gone into Settings->Safari->Passwords & Autofill -> Saved Passwords, and the website in question does not show up in the list with a 'never' entry to delete.\nHow can I make Safari forget to keep forgetting this login info?\n\nA: Manually enter your username and password. Tap \"Passwords\" right above your keyboard. Tap \"Save This Password.\" It still won't autofill when you first load the page, but now you can tap in the username field and hit \"Autofill Password.\" There seems to be no way to actually reset the \"Never for this site\" setting. Sounds like a job for http://apple.com/feedback.\n\nA: I’ve actually figured out a way to undo this. It’s klunky AF, but it works. Go to the login page you’re looking to undo this for, and tap the “passwords” label on top of the onscreen keyboard. From the pop up that appears, select “suggest new password”. Attempt to login with the new password. While you won’t successfully login with it, a login entry for the site will now be saved in your account password settings. Edit the entry with the correct information, and you’re done. \n\nA: On your iPhone just clear the history of your Safari and then visit the website again... it's done, now just go back to the Safari on your iPhone and just put credentials it will ask you for if you want to save or not.\n", "Q: Why does the brightness still automatically adjust after turning it off (Mavericks) I turned off automatic brightness adjusting in the display preference pane (as explained here).

What happened to the celebrity AppleMasters† program that used to live on Apple's website? Is it closed down? Are there any fan sites out there for the AppleMasters?\n†) link defunct\n\nA: From AppleMasters wikipedia page:\n\nThe AppleMasters program was launched in 1996.[3] Based on findings at archive.org's WayBackMachine, Apple removed the program from their web site on or before August 7, 2002.[4]\n\nSo it seems the feature has been long gone, which can be confirmed from the linked Internet Archive crawl index.\nAs for the \"fan sites\": I found one self-proclaimed fan site: kdunn.org. It currently hosts two videos—presumably related to AppleMasters.\nYou would probably have much better results searching the YouTube for AppleMasters than searching for fan sites per se.\n", "Q: Bluetooth not available anymore I have a Macbook Pro (late 2011) with the latest OS X (10.9.4) and once in a while the Bluetooth subsystem disappears and the system hangs for a few seconds every ~10 minutes.

Or (more interesting of course) what is the cause of this infrequent hang and how can I heal it completely?\nI cannot remember which software I've installed at the time the error started to show, it might have been bootcamp to support a 32 bit windows in a virtual machine or some Citrix software (Citrix Access Gateway)\n\nA: Here is the list of all Apple BT symbols and they meaning.\n\nAdditional steps:\nLog in as different user to see if it is your profile related.\nStart in safe mode to see if other applications are making problems\nSince you have another major problem with missing BT in sys pref, resetting SMC and PRAM might help.\nUse Manual method to ON/OFF the BT\nType Bluetooth in Spotlight\nSelect Application- Bluetooth Exchange\nwill bring up a switching window\n\nLast not least, reinstall your OS.\n\nA: If an SMC \"soft\" reset doesn't work using the official method, remove the bottom cover and disconnect the battery for a few minutes. I had issues with a non-existent SD card reader on my 2011 MBP, it wasn't recognised in System Profiler and none of the usual resets would make it work.\nIt wasn't a software issue in my case as booting from an external drive gave exactly the same result. Giving the system a \"hard\" reset by pulling the battery for a few minutes restored full functionality to the card reader and it's been fine ever since.\nThis may or may not help in your case but it illustrates the standard SMC reset routine doesn't always clear hardware configuration and management issues.\n\nA: I have re-installed the software on the computer and pulled off the battery, but the problem persists.

Of course if the other account isn't signed in this won't work, in which case a last known count is fine.\nI suppose maybe I'm just spoiled by smart phones that let you see message count (or even messages) from a lock-screen, but it'd be nice to have something similar without having to actually add the same e-mail account to Mail for both users.\n\nA: I think @Buscar웃 is right, you need to fetch your mail before you know how much mail is in your inbox.\nI think you can use your Terminal for that, and with the combination of 'GeekBench' it might even look pretty.\nA common mailclient for OS X terminal is mail, it is already installed, but unfortunately I have no clue on how to configure it correctly.\nAnother terminal mail client is mutt.

This makes sure that git stays on my path, and makes it easy for me to keep git up-to-date, as well as making it easy to install other software, with its dependencies.\nTo install things with Homebrew, you first need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.  StackOverflow has a great answer on installing the command line tools on OSX 10.9.\nAfter you have installed the Xcode Command Line Tools, you may notice that there is a git command you can use: see Does installing Command Line Tools for Xcode also install Git? That is not the Homebrew version of git, so it doesn't track updates.\nNext, go to http://brew.sh and follow their directions for installing Homebrew.  That will install git into the Homebrew directory, and link git to /usr/local/bin/git.  /usr/local/bin should end up on your PATH before /usr/local/git, so you will end up using the Homebrew version of git.\nAfter that, you can install anything for which Homebrew has a formula, including the latest versions of git. Use brew update to keep your index of available packages up to date, and brew doctor to verify that your Homebrew configuration is correct.  Then you can use brew upgrade git to keep your git at the latest version available to Homebrew. \n", "Q: Failing to connect to WiFi network with MacAuthEvent error I'm unable to connect to any WiFi network.

All I did was to use the HD's OS partition to install OS on the SSD. The HD has another partition that is a time machine backup, but I didn't use that for SSD. This HD had been used as various data backups before I made any partitions in it. I guess what I'm trying to say is, can data that's currently on another partition or was stored in the past on the whole HD unknowingly transfer into the SSD by just fresh-insalling OS?\n\nA: If you used installed OS X on your SSD from a bootable hard drive partition that was cloned from an install DVD, nothing else residing on your hard drive will be copied over without you knowing about it.\nThe only time user data is copied over onto a new drive is when transferring from a Time Machine volume or a disk in Thunderbolt/Firewire Target mode - something that cannot happen without your knowledge or consent.\n", "Q: Commandline tools not installed with Server.app on Mavericks I installed the Server.app from the App Store to use the bundeled postgres DB:\nsudo serveradmin start postgres\n\nThen I found out, that the commandline tool \"serveradmin\" (and others) have not been installed as implied by other postings.\nWas this a change by Apple, or did I miss something?\n\nA: I found the path.

I saw the Intuos creative stylus for the iPad, and as much as I like it, I am not a fan of having to purchase a new Mac product just to use a pen that works with the iPad only... \nIs there a pen out there that works like the Intuos creative stylus pen for iPad that would work with a MacBook Pro? I've heard of using the MagicMouse, but I'm looking for the same concept as the Intuos creative stylus for iPad, where the stylus would connect via a bluetooth, with the same abilities of an Inkling, drawing anywhere...  \nIs this even possible? Paying for it isn't an issue, it's just I can't justify $400+ for a iPad, the software, and the pen itself...\nAny help would be appreciated. \n\nA: Short answer:\nCertainly not possible, and no such product exists. The MacBook screen is not a touch or pressure input device, unlike the iPad.\nLong answer:\nThe iPad stylus uses touch events to communicate position and Bluetooth to communicate pressure. With the MacBook, no positional tracking device exists in the screen.\nGetting around this limitation would involve adding a sensor layer to the glass. This would be a hardware modification and you'd end up writing a lot of software to support it, too.\n\nA: The MacBooks trackpad is basically the iPhone touchscreen without a display.

Even stranger, the length of time to complete each operation in a loop appears to be increasing over time! For example, my script should match about 300 e-mails (processed from a list totalling around 500), after five minutes it will match around 100 e-mails, but after twenty it will only have matched around 125, having slowed down to the point that it takes nearly a minute to process each e-mail, and continues to get worse until the script eventually finishes after about three hours.\nHere's a simplified version of the script:\nset ignoreTheseMailboxes to { \"Inbox\", \"Drafts\", \"Junk\", \"Sent\", \"Trash\" }\nset expiryDate to (current date) - (45 * days) as date\n\nset myLogFile to open for access POSIX file \"/Users/username/Desktop/test.log\" with write permission\n\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theAccounts to every account\n    repeat with eachAccount in theAccounts\n        set theMailboxes to mailboxes in eachAccount\n        write name of eachAccount & return to myLogFile\n\n        repeat with eachMailbox in theMailboxes\n            if (ignoreTheseMailboxes does not contain (name of eachMailbox) then\n                write \" \" & name of eachMailbox & return to myLogFile\n\n                set theMessages to messages in eachMailbox\n                repeat with eachMessage in theMessages\n                    if date received of eachMessage <= expiryDate then\n                        write \"     \" & subject of eachMessage & return to myLogFile\n                    end if\n                end repeat\n            end if\n        end repeat\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nclose myLogFile\n\nYou'll have to forgive any typos from me slimming things down, but the above is the basic behaviour of the script, and exhibits the same problem when run across the same e-mail accounts and messages.\nWhat I'd like to know is, what is the reason that a script like this would experience increasing slowdowns, and is there a way to optimise it to avoid these kinds of issues?\nIt's just unfortunate that we can't see smart folders in Mail, as it could significantly reduce the number of messages needing to be searched (and avoid the need to test them).\n[edit]\nAlso, I should note that during operation the process running the script will creep up quickly to 100% CPU usage, so AppleScript is definitely doing something, I just can't figure out what!\n\nA: It seems the issue isn't with AppleScript, but with Script Editor, after confirming it with a back and forth with an Apple engineer. I'm still not convinced of why this should be the case, but the script runs a lot better when run via osascript, especially after refactoring it to use a whose statement when fetching messages, rather than iterating over them with an if condition.\n", "Q: Can I create a share on a Windows Server Domain Controller for anonymous Mac OS access?

The cause of this according to the /var/lib/mysql/hostname.err file was that TCP over port 4567 was going out via multicast and was getting dropped by our network, so it never completes the mysql start process and hence never creates the PID file.

I Can find a ton of information and fixes online for this issue in a Windows environment, or an Exchange environment, But can't turn up any information regarding this issue in OSX. \nThe issue i'm running into is the same one outlined here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2222370 - But as you can see, there's only information on resolving this issue on Windows. Can anyone shed any light on how i could resolve this under OSX? \nCheers!\n\nA: This is not a client-side setting that you can control.  This is a server-side setting, which is to say, it's something that Microsoft limits (as do most internet service providers).  Since your attachment is larger than their limit, you could upload it to oneDrive and then send a link to the file on oneDrive to your intended recipient.  You should have at least 7 GB available in your oneDrive account, possibly more, depending on which Office 365 subscription you have.\n", "Q: Sync applications between several countries' stores I have a problem with managing purchases from different stores. As you know, Apple doesnt' provide the one global store for purchases made in different countries and some applications are published only in only local country store. Given that, I now have purchases in two countries and realized it's hard to keep track of applications, remove unnecessary and not used and so on. \nI decided to clean up my account and hide not used anymore applications. But it's a completely mess: something is downloaded on my mac, something on iphone, something on ipad, it all syncs in ununderstandable ways.\nMy question is: how do you handle this situation with different stores? I'm thinking about re-purchasing all applications in my current country's  store, but I got used too much to packaging managers and can't imagine doing it manually.\n\nA: I just got my new phone and wanted to sync to the backup of my old phone. The problem was with the apps. I deleted the foreign country's apps that were automatically put on the phone by the service provider (that I was never going to use anyway) and this solved my problem. \n\nA: The simple way to clean things up is to delete all apps you no longer want from iTunes and then carefully examine things the next time you sync.\nBy deleting the apps you wish to no longer maintain, you can avoid updates and installs.\nAs to the purchase history, hiding purchases and avoiding re-downloading is the only mechanism that Apple provides today to manage multiple country purchases against the same one Apple ID.\n\nA: I use to have the same problem, cause I had an account from my own home country, the country where I currently live and the US Store. What I did was delete all the applications from my iPod, iPhone and iPad. On my Mac I authorised the iTunes with all the three accounts, and then I applications that I wanted on each I synced, it asked me for a password if I hadn't used this id on the device and that was it. I still use it and I am not being asked for a password everytime. \nP.S: I basically use the US store for most of the purchases, occasionally I use the regional stores if the app is not available in the US store. \nP.P.S: I download and updates the app from iTunes and not the device directly.\n", "Q: How can an app be running yet not appear in the Dock? On two instances, I've been unable to empty my trash because it contained a pdf that the system claimed was in use. On both occasions, I typed the lsof command to find out which app was using it. In both instances, Preview was indicated -- yet it wasn't shown in the Dock! Activity Monitor does show Preview running.\nHow can this be?\n\nA: It's possible that the plist of the application has been changed (eg, /Applications/Preview.app/Contents/Info.plist).  There is a setting LSUIElement, which if is true, causes the app to be hidden from the dock, the ⌘-Tab application switcher, etc.  See this similar question for more details.\n\nA: What you are experiencing is a side effect of Automatic Termination a feature that was introduced in 10.7 Lion. This feature lets the operating system shut down applications whenever it either needs the resources they are using or when it decides you aren't using them anymore. However while it removes the application from your screen,  if it has enough resources it will keep the process around in a sleeping state just in case you plan to reuse it, allowing it to quickly relaunch it.\nYou can easily test this for yourself by opening a single JPEG in Preview. If you close the JPEG and bring another application to the foreground you should see Preview disappear from your dock almost instantly. However if you check Activity Monitor, for a while, you should still see Preview listed but sitting with 0.0 CPU, and if you run ps -j | grep Preview you should see the process listed but with state set to \"S\" for sleeping.\nIf Preview was preventing you from clearing PDF files from your Mac, my guess is that you had the files open in Preview but the application had been in the background for a while, so the OS decided you weren't using it anymore and closed it. However it still had the Preview process running in a sleeping state ready to bring quickly back to life should you want it, coincidentally keeping access to the PDF files open as well, preventing them being deleted. Given time, the OS would release Preview from memory and release its hold on the files as well. \n\nA: What is shown in the dock has little correlation to everything that's running. The Dock is just a GUI showing, generally, if a GUI component of an app is running. There are hundreds of various background processes running that will not be shown in the Dock; I'd imagine Preview might have some background process to write out changes or something that could stay alive even though the GUI closed. Another thing that might be going on is that the system keeps it in memory for a while even though you closed it, for purposes like caching / faster app startup.\nThe bottom line is that you can't really expect the Dock to mirror what exactly is going on in the system; it's just a simple GUI for regular users.\n", "Q: Running meld: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append_search_path' After upgrading to Mountain Lion 10.8.5 I can no longer run meld via X11.

How can I display the iMac and its menus on another computer to explore other diagnostics? On a Mac Pro?\n\nA: Try an external display. If that doesn't work at all then your display controller may have died. If you do get a display then your internal display panel may have died.\nI had a display failure last year on one of our 2012 iMacs at work. An external display worked fine. The key to resolving our issue was it came up as the only connected display - the iMac had lost communication with the internal panel. The display controller clearly was working as it was happily driving our external monitor. Replacing the panel was the solution in our case.\nIf you still wish to perform diagnostics (and working on the assumption that your iMac doesn't have Screen Sharing, Remote Login or Remote Management enabled in your Sharing preferences) your best bet may be to use another Mac to create a temporary OS X installation on an external drive. On this drive ensure Screen Sharing is enabled. \nThen, start your iMac with the external drive connected and hold down the Option key to bring up the boot selector - which you obviously won't be able to see on the internal display. Press the right arrow key once and hit enter, and all being well your iMac should startup from the temp OS X installation.\nMake sure your second Mac is connected to the same network as the sick iMac. The iMac should appear in the Shared list in Finder and you will be able to initiate a remote session via the Screen Sharing option.\n", "Q: Resetting PRAM without a(n) (Apple) keyboard? A while back I had an issue with my (2013) iMac not recognizing the keyboard after it was unplugged and re-plugged in.  I had to actually power down the iMac and power it back up before it would recognize the keyboard.  After taking it in to an Apple Store (a 30 mile drive, very inconvenient) they simply reset the PRAM and the problem went away.\nNow I find the computer is not recognizing the keyboard again, but this time it doesn't even reset it from a cold boot.  I have tried the keyboard on another iMac and it works there, so I don't think the problem is the keyboard. I would like to try resetting the PRAM again to avoid a trip to the Apple Store if possible, but since the keyboard isn't recognized... well, how do I reset the PRAM?  Is there a way to do it without a keyboard?  Or is there a similar key sequence on a non-Apple keyboard?  I am currently using a Dell keyboard and it works for normal usage, but I don't seem to have all the keys I need to reset the PRAM - I have P and R but where are \"command\" and \"option\"?\n\nA: You can recreate the NVRAM reset's ⌘-⌥-P-R with a PC keyboard by pressing:\n Windows Key + Alt + P + R\n", "Q: What is the correct way to install python on OS X?

How do I stop the Adobe Creative Cloud app from auto-launching on login? I don't see any option of stopping this, and for some reason it's not in OS X's user login options. \n\nA: To turn off everything Adobe launches at startup on the Mac you need to both disable its launchd jobs and the Adobe Core Sync extension.\nFor the Adobe Core Sync extension, it is a Finder Sync extension so you can disable it under  System Preferences → Extensions as described in this answer - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/237585/23876.  From what I have seen, you will need to repeat this step after each Adobe Creative Cloud upgrade.\nFor the launchd jobs, read on. Note that the following will also disable Adobe automatic update checking. So you will need to check for updates from inside one of the Adobe apps or explicitly run Adobe Create Cloud.\nAdobe actually puts their launchd job definitions in several places and those places change depending on the Adobe version. Building on @Alan Shutko’s answer, the following will disable them everywhere. You can ignore any “Could not find specified service” warnings. After running, reboot to enjoy an Adobe free launch (until you actually run an Adobe product).\nlaunchctl unload -w {,~}/Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.*.plist\nsudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.adobe.*.plist\n\nAs background, launchctl unload -w disables each service in the override database. launchd will follow the override database entry even if the job definition (e.g. /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist) is marked as enabled. The override database is on a per user basis. LaunchDaemon jobs are run as root so we use sudo to disable them for the root user. \nFrom what I have seen so far, Adobe installs do not update the override database, so you shouldn't need to run the commands again after an Adobe install (unless they introduce another job). Please comment if someone does see Adobe touching the override database.\nFor more information on launchd, the launchd Tutorial is a great overview on launchd jobs. And LaunchControl is a good tool for working with launchd jobs. LaunchControl is a paid app, but the trial version supports viewing them. Be sure to enable tooltips so you can see the override database values. \n\nA: *\n\n*Click on the menu bar icon.\n\n*Click the ellipsis icon at the top-right.\n\n*Select “Preferences”\n\n\n*Uncheck “Launch at login”.\n\n\n*Note: The “Preferences” option does not appear until you log in to Creative Cloud.\n\nA: It is loaded by default by /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist. \nIf you run\nlaunchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist\n\nthat will disable it for your user.\nTo turn it back on\nlaunchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist\n\n\nA: I'm currently using this set of commands—the wildcard answer will be a bit more future-proof if Adobe adds more services, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple is shifting to having these services embedded inside app bundles, so new services added by Adobe may not appear in the usual /Library/Launch*/ paths but still have the same infuriating launch-at-login behavior and\n\n*this answer lets you target a single user (if you have multiple users on your machine) for the Creative Cloud UI and sync daemon, should you wish to leave them in place for another person.\n\n\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.adobe.acc.installer.v2\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.adobe.acc.installer\nsudo launchctl disable system/Adobe_Genuine_Software_Integrity_Service\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.adobe.agsservice\nlaunchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.adobe.acc.AdobeCreativeCloud.2416\nlaunchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.adobe.accmac.2256\nlaunchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.adobe.CCXProcess.2252\nlaunchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.adobe.CreativeCloud\nlaunchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.adobe.CCLibrary.4032\nlaunchctl disable gui/$(id -u)/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud\n\n", "Q: Overtype mode in Terminal.app As a Linux/Windows user, I am used to switching temporarily to Overtype Mode when using the command prompt.\nAs a new user to the Mac world, I do not know how to change text input mode from normal (i.e. Insert Mode) to Overtype Mode.\nThis is of particular use to me at the command prompt, but also in text editors (eg TextWrangler or Sublime).\nAnyone know of ways (using the keyboard only) to toggle between the two modes?

I tried Fiddler and Keepass on Mono and both these applications start, their icons jump on the Dock, but no window is displayed.\n\nA: This might seem like a silly suggestion but are you giving the applications enough time to launch?\nI tried installing and launching both applications. The first launch took a surprising amount of time; as you describe the icon appears in the Dock almost immediately but then no UI seems to appear. However if you leave it long enough the UI then does appear (about 4-5 minutes on a 2011 Macbook Pro).\nSubsequent launches are a lot faster.\nIf you are curious to see what it is doing you can run this sudo opensnoop -v | grep mono-sgen in a Terminal when you launch the applications. On my system the delay on initial launch just seems to be Mono reading all the fonts on my system and caching them in ~/.cache/fontconfig. Luckily it just seems wants to do that once.\n\nA: I think you need a UI Toolkit to interface with the Mono framework.\nFAQ: Basics\n\nWhat is Mono™ exactly?\nThe Mono Project is an open development initiative sponsored by Novell to develop an open source, UNIX version of the Microsoft .NET development platform. Its objective is to enable UNIX developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET Applications. The project implements various technologies developed by Microsoft that have now been submitted to the ECMA for standardization.\n\nFAQ: GUI applications\n\nWill Mono enable GUI applications to be authored?\nYes, you will be able to build GUI applications.\nIndeed, that was the main driver for the creation of Mono. Today you can use Gtk# to develop GUI applications on Windows, Linux and MacOS X.\nWe are also developing a complete Windows.Forms implementation.\nA list of pros and cons on the various APIs is available in our Gui Toolkits page.\n\nYou can check Banshee (audio player) as a working example.

I don't have an iPhone 5S, but I know that I can set my iOS devices to automatically erase themselves, when the wrong passcode has been entered too many times. Does Touch ID on the 5S do the same? \nI imagine this to be rather inconvenient, since accidentally touching the ID sensor is very likely.\n\nA: Quoting from About Touch ID Security, from Apple’s website:\n\nTouch ID only allows five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before you must enter your passcode, and you can’t proceed until doing so.\n\nYou then get ten attempts at your passcode before the device erases, but these are counted separately from attempts to authenticate with Touch ID.\nThis is slightly different from the other answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*After three attempts, the iPhone will present the passcode screen, but you can still have two more tries at authenticating with Touch ID.\n\n*After five attempts, Touch ID is disabled until you successfully enter your passcode.\nApple’s security documents don’t mention a setting to erase the device after failed Touch ID attempts, and I’m not aware of one. I don’t believe that iOS devices would erase themselves after five unsuccessful attempts, at least not with the current version of iOS.\n\nA: If you try and fail 3 times with Touch ID, then it asks for your passcode.

Here is a site with instructions:\nhttp://www.mactip.net/how-to-edit-the-hosts-file-on-a-mac/\n\nSimilarly, it’s possible to block a harmful domain by mapping it to the localhost. Thereby preventing the computer from reaching the domain. In this situation, map the bad domain to 127.0.0.1. It will not be able to connect.\n\nSo all you have to do is add a line like this:\n127.0.0.1    badwebsite.com\n\nto your hosts file.\n", "Q: How to repair a MacBook Pro 2007 hard drive bus? Is there a repair I can do to the hard drive bus on a MacBook Pro 2007?\nI've changed the SATA cable but it still won't see the drive, which I know is good as it boots externally! Disk Utility doesn't detect it either.\n\nA: If you're certain the drive is known to be good and working and that the cable you're using is also in good condition then the answer is no: there isn't anything you can do to fix a broken controller yourself. You'll need to take it to an authorized Apple Repair Center. These things are usually solved with main board swaps as it's all, more or less, integrated on one board in this case.\n", "Q: Deleting Active Leaderboards and Achievements I know that Apple says you cannot delete leaderboards and achievements once they are active. Is there a way to get them to not show up on an updated version of the game? Or do I have to delete my app and remake everything?

I'm a college student and a student employee at my college's IT office. We recently upgraded to Google Apps for Education for our college email, and we also have a high proportion of Mac users on campus (students, faculty, staff, and administrators). \nMy manager in IT pointed out that since Mavericks came out, it seems as though Mail.app is automatically downloading the entirety of all messages from the server for caching purposes so Spotlight can search them instantly. For normal users, I'd imagine this is fine. We have some institutional users with 20+ years of email (hundreds of thousands of messages), and this new feature of Mac Mail is slowing their computers down significantly. My manager said that Mail.app previously just downloaded message headers, but now it's downloading full text and attachments. From searching this topic on AskDifferent, I know that it's possible to turn off auto-downloading of attachments by going to Preferences>Accounts>Advanced> and unchecking \"Automatically download attachments.\"\nIs there a way to turn off the auto-downloading of full message text as well, and force Mail.app to only download headers of archived mail?\n\nA: You may try a workaround: users with high email count can configure their Google Apps accounts not to sync more than 1000 emails per label (or folder).   \nEach user will have to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Go to their Gmail interface  \n\n*Go to Settings (by clicking on the gear in the upper-right hand side of the page)  \n\n*Select the Forwarding and POP/IMAP tab  \n\n*Look for \"Folder Size Limit \"and check \"Limit IMAP folders to contain no more than this many messages\" and select 1000 (or another number that seems appropriate)\n\n\nA: A contrario to Outlook included with Office for Mac Pro 2011 it seems there's no option to \"download only headers\"...\nHow ever I've seen in older version (or for POP accounts only) you could skip message that are greater than a determined size...

Will disabling Spotlight completely (via mdutil) affect Time Machine?\n\nA: Yes Time Machine require a spotlight index on the backup volume. As a result, you cannot add a Time machine volume in the privacy list.\nApple explained this by stating:\nIf you add a Time Machine backup disk to the privacy list, you will \ncontinue to see messages that Spotlight is indexing your backup disk. \nThis indexing is necessary for Time Machine to function properly and \ncan’t be disabled. Spotlight does exclude from searches any items \nyou store on your backup disk that are not part of a Time Machine\nbackup.\n\nI have just tried adding my TM backup drive to the exclusion list in Catalina 10.15.4 and it was refused stating that I cannot add a Timemachine Backup to the privacy list of spotlight. - Others have tried the same in Mojave 10.14.2, in Sierra and High Sierra, with the same result.\nAgain others have tried doing this more ingeniously in the command line, only to find that mdworker continued to access the backups making indexes.\nOddly, though, Apple has removed its earlier article(s) about this altogether, and there is no longer any official line as to whether it’s possible.\n", "Q: My Mac died and I can't access iPhoto on my external hard drive My Mac died. \nWhen I connect my external hard drive to my laptop I can't access my iPhoto – it says iPhoto won't open because it's a machine backup. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: Background\niPhoto and external storage\nIt's true that with a normally running operating system on a Mac, an iPhoto library can be stored on an external drive. \nNormal running of iPhoto will involve file system writes to the iPhoto library and elsewhere. \nTime Machine and the file system\nWhen Time Machine backs up to an HFS Plus file system, most of the files that are associated with its backups database are saved in a way that prevents further edition; that prevents deletion – prevention until it becomes necessary for a point in time in the backup to be thinned. \niPhoto and Time Machine backup databases\nBecause edition and writes are prevented, iPhoto will be unable to launch and work with any iPhoto library that's within a backup database …\n\nBest use of the backup drive when one of two Macs has failed\nEssentially, as soon as possible, you should restore your iPhoto library – and whatever else you will need: \n\n\n*\n\n*from the backup drive\n\n*to a separate drive\n\n\nThe destination drive can be internal or external. \nSide note: do not aim to restore from the backup drive to a different area of the same drive; you would continue to have a single point of failure, which is horribly risky. \nIf the only failure of the failed Mac was its internal disk drive\nConsider replacing that failed internal drive. Then use Time Machine to restore data to the replacement drive. \n(What model is the failed Mac, how much memory does it have, and so on? Edit your question to include relevant details – thanks.)\nIf the internal disk drive of the failed Mac is a good drive, and if that Mac is beyond economical repair\nTake the good internal drive. Consider arranging for it to be placed in an enclosure that will be suitable for use with your good Mac laptop. So you'll have an additional external drive for use with whatever computer you want. \n(What model is that good Mac laptop, how much memory does it have, and so on?)\nCost comparison\nIt's likely that a suitable external drive enclosure will be more economical than a drive. \nInitial cost should be not the only factor in your decision … adding background information (specifications etc.) to your question should help people to make recommendations in answers. \n\nA: And if you do not connect your external hard drive to your laptop, then you can access iPhoto? This is how I interpret your question...\niPhoto remembers the last selected iPhoto library - may be this is the problem?\nThe solution might be: hold down the option key (ALT) and launch iPhoto: iPhoto will show you a dialog with different options: either you can use the last selected library or you change the current library.\nIf this does not help, then it might help to improve your question. :-)\n", "Q: Change m4v type from Home Video to Movie How can I via the command line change the iTunes Media type from Home Video to Movie?   After I convert a DVD to m4v via Handbrake I would like to set the iTunes media type.\nI can do this manually in iTunes but I'm looking for a command line approach so that I can automate it.\n\nA: The best approach is using Subler to open the m4v file and then fetch the metadata from the iTunes Store or MovieDB. Then, just save it and add it to your iTunes library. This is as automated as the process will get. \n\nA: Just change the extension from \"m4v\" to \"mp4\"?\nBecause \"m4v\" is - if you convert a video with Handbrake - a MPEG-4 file. And the usual extension for MPEG-4 files is \"mp4\" and not \"m4v\".\nThe question seems to be solved, but I have some questions to learn a little bit. :-)\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is Handbrake setting the video extension to \"m4v\"? This extension is unusual and for special content (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4V). As Handbrake says: convert to\nMP4, so the file extension should be \"mp4\" and not \"m4v\".\n\n*What do you mean with \"iTunes Media Type\" and \"Home Video\" - do you mean \"Movies\" and \"TV Shows\"? The difference between \"Movie\" and\n\"TV Shows\" is usually only a difference if you download iTunes DRM\n(aka iTunes bought or rented videos).\n\n*How can I change the \"iTunes Media type\" - and what for?\n\n*You voted \"njboot\" answer as solution, but I do not understand what \"m4v\" has to do with metadata from the iTunes Store or MovieDB.\n\n\nAs I said: just want to learn. My suggestion: just change \"m4v\" to \"mp4\".\nI just converted a DVD with Handbrake and changed \"m4v\" to \"mp4\" - no problem. Then I added the video to iTunes (both: \"m4v\" and \"mp4\") - and both were added to \"Movies\".\nP.S.

It says that I should do this by adding a line to the file .bashrc. However, this file doesn't appear to exist in my computer. I also read something about a file called .profile which doesn't appear either. I found /etc/profile, but it says I have no permission to open it.\nCould you please help me? I simply need to add a folder to the classpath.\n\nA: Yes, this file doesn't exist by default. The difference between bash_profile or .bashrc versus .profile is that the latter will be read by shells other than bash. For your purposes, you can simply name it .bashrc. Open up Terminal and enter the following command:\ncd ~/; touch .bashrc; open -a TextEdit .bashrc\n\nNow you have a created a profile, which the bash shell will read from everytime you log into it. \nNext, simply enter the variable as plain text in the document:\nexport CLASSPATH=/path/to/folder\n\nOr, if your have a current $CLASSPATH that needs to be added to, append the folder to it in your profile:\nexport CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/folder\n\nSave the .bashrc file.

Is this possible?\n\nA: Yes. Log in to the Apple ID that you want to use for iTunes and the App Store in the iTunes & App Store section of settings, then log in to the individual Apple ID for the iCloud account. These will be kept separate and allow individual iCloud accounts but a shared iTunes Apple ID.\nAlso, with the upcoming iOS 8, you can use Family Sharing.\n", "Q: How to back up iCloud Calendars/Reminders/Contacts I use iCloud for my calendars/contacts/reminders because it's just so convenient to share all the data instantly between all my devices, but I can't help worrying about what would happen if Apple's servers have a brain-fart. So I'd like to make my own backups. And, of course, I'd like those backups to happen completely automatically, with no human intervention at all, because I'm sure you all know that manual backups are backups that just stop happening.\nIdeally the code for making these backups would run on the Linux machine that is responsible for all my other backups, and I'm happy to write the code to do this myself.\nMy question is ... can anyone point me at documentation for the protocols and APIs that Apple's applications use?\n\nA: No API. No protocol.\nBut there are three workarounds I can think of.

With it, you can read the mouse position using the p:. command, move the mouse using the m:x,y command, and click using the c:. command.\nThis is a bit of a hack, really, but regarding the multi-monitor support, you can use Slate, where you can programmatically call Cliclick with the coordinates of the mouse in a different monitor. I'm sure there are other alternatives, though. I also used Slate to bind the other first calls to Cliclick.\nThe \"mouse mode\" is a bit tougher. In Slate you can create \"modal hotkeys\" pressing two hotkeys in succession (like ^W in Vim), but no support for whole modes. You could, however, dynamically edit the .slate.js binding file to contain \"normal mode\" or \"mouse mode\" bindings each time you change the mode.\nI did something similar yesterday, so hope this helps. :)\n\nA: I use the nifty app: Karabiner:\nhttps://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\nIt's useful for major keyboard remapping, and there are packaged config options for using the keyboard to move the mouse, click, and even scrolling!\n\nA: I found an app that does this! \nKeytty\n", "Q: How to put a application in fullscreen using shell command in Mavericks?

Is there a way that we can allow for multiple sessions for Xcode development within the server?  Would RealVNC allow multiple remote sessions? If so how many?\n\nA: You get two graphical interface log in sessions simultaneously on OS X (server.app or without server.app) and there is no configuration needed as this is the default settings. Just use any VNC client and set up two or more users local to the server.\nYou'll want to set up the Mac Mini with Xcode Server running and then have each developer run Xcode locally. When they make code changes, you can have the server compile things \"continuous integration\" style.\nSimilarly, you could just run your own CI infrastructure on the Mini running whatever OS you wish, but count on the server to only let two workers (either one local and one remote or both remote) to run Xcode GUI itself from each Mac.\n", "Q: Keep Finder location when switching between list view and icon view In Finder, if you are at a deep in folders or files while viewing as list mode and then you clicked on icons mode, the Finder shows all folders from the root of volume.

So, I coincidentally noticed the following behavior:\nSome windows can be closed by pressing the esc key, like the Preference window in any app or the 'Safari help' window or the 'Fonts' window in TextExit for example.\nOther windows can not be closed by pressing the esc key, like the Safari browser window or the 'Special Characters' window.\nThe default cmd w always seems to work.\nWhat is the rule for keystrokes on closing windows? When are we allowed to use esc ?\n\nA: What you're seeing, namely, the behavior where the Escape key closes the window, is automatically built in to the NSPanel class, which is a subclass of NSWindow.\nFrom Window Programming Guide > How Panels Work:\n\nA panel is a special kind of window, typically serving an auxiliary\n  function in an application. The NSPanel subclass of NSWindow adds\n  a few special behaviors to windows in support of the role panels play:\n...\n• If a panel is the key window and has a close button, it closes itself\nwhen the user presses the Escape key.\n\nThe preferences window (or panel) in many applications is implemented as an NSPanel: for example, Safari, Preview, Terminal, Console. The Fonts panel in Cocoa apps is implemented as an NSPanel. When you choose Safari > Safari Help, it actually launches an invisible background application, HelpViewer.app (/System/Library/CoreServices/HelpViewer.app), whose main window is implemented as a floating NSPanel. For these reasons, those panels will respond to the Escape key by closing the window. Standard general windows, which are instances of NSWindow, don't automatically get this behavior, as only panels are meant to behave that way.\n\nA: Using the esc key to close a modal dialog is usually the same as pressing the Cancel button for the dialog. This is similar to how pressing the Return or Enter keys confirms the action for the button that is highlighted.\nThis has been in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for Macintosh since the very beginning and is not new to OS X. The guideline can be found here under the \"Dismissing Dialogs\" heading:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/applehiguidelines/Windows/Windows.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000961-TPXREF56\nSearch for \"escape\" on that page. The match is about 3/4 of the way down the page and is explicit about this behavior.\nFrom the Human Interface Guidelines:\n\nIn general, include a Cancel button. The Cancel button returns the\n  computer to the state it was in before the dialog appeared. It means\n  “forget I mentioned it.” Also, make sure that the keyboard shortcut\n  Command-period and the Esc (Escape) key are mapped to the Cancel\n  button.\n\nAnother useful behavior, is if a dialog accepts Return or Enter as part of a text field, very often pressing Command-Return will press the default button.\n", "Q: How to (re)create Recovery HD?

But the screen is dimmed so much it is black and cannot tell when to put in the code? Help\n\nA: The screen dim controls on the side of the device won't dim the display that much. It might be a backlight failure and the device could need a repair.\nYou can take the device into a room with a table lamp and usually shine the light on the side to see enough to operate a screen even with the backlight totally failed.\nYou can unlock the device by connecting it to the computer that it normally syncs to in some cases as well.\n\nA: With iOS 7 you can open Control Center to adjust the brightness.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the display on using the lock button.

When I copy/paste a file into a folder where a  file with the same name exists, instead of replacing, it changes the filename to 'file Copy'.\nIs there a way to copy/replace similar to windows or ubuntu?\nI am using OSX 10.8.5.\n\nA: By default in OS X Mavericks, dragging a file into a folder that contains a file with the same name will prompt you for what you would like to do.\nTake, for example, these two folders: Folder1 and Folder2. Both contain a text file called Test.txt.\nDragging Test.txt from Folder1 into Folder2 will result in this dialog:\n\n\"Keep Both\" will result in the file being named Test copy.txt. \"Replace\" does exactly what you want - replaces Folder2/Test.txt with Folder1's Test.txt.\n\nAs user dval has discovered, earlier versions of OS X may require that you hold down ⌘ while you drag a file into another folder in order to see the \"Replace\" option.\n", "Q: Create image links in PDF I have a Word document that has an image link (it has a URL associated with it).  I would like to create a PDF rendition of this document, preserving the image link.\nWhen I save the document as PDF (File > Print... > PDF > Save as PDF...) the link is removed.  Text-based links (e.g. foo.com, http://apple.stackexchange.com) are preserved, however.\nIs this a limitation of PDF or Word's PDF interface?  Is there a solution?\n\nA: This looks to me like a shortcoming of the Word PDF export function.\nYou may try it with the PDFMaker macro (coming with Acrobat). If the PDFMaker macro does not get it through, there is little chance that it is recognized by any PDF exporter. In this case, the simplest way to get the link back in is to open the PDF in Acrobat, use the Link tool and add the link again.\nFWIW, in Acrobat, you may also check whether the Word PDF export does really create a link over text links, or whether it is the PDF viewer recognizing some text looking like a link and make it an active link on the fly.\n", "Q: Error: \"The operation can’t be completed because one or more required items can’t be found.

I tried using iCloud account.  But it did not seem to work.  basically, I signed into iCloud on both iDevices with same Apple ID.  And making sure Notes was set to on.  Newly created notes will show up on both devices.  But I also need the current local previously created notes to sync as well.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: With iOS 9:\nOpen the Folder containing the Notes you want to move.\nClick the Edit button. It is faint. You might not see it right away.\nYou will see a column of selection circles ⭕️ appear, and also the words Delete All and Move All.\nTap the circles for your target Notes, then Move To ..., and the destination.\nAll done.\n\nA: As it turned out, Apple does not provide an option to auto sync/copy previously created notes for Notes app to iCloud in order to sync to other iDevice.  From this doc:\n\"In Notes on your iOS device or Mac, verify that your notes are not stored in a local folder. Example: On My iPhone or On My Mac. If you have notes in these folders, you will need to copy or transfer them to iCloud or IMAP to sync with your other devices.\"\nWell you will need to literately do what what doc said: copy/paste one note at a time to iCloud.  If you had previously create notes and once you signed in iCloud account, the Notes app will show two accounts: \"On My iPhone (or iPad)\" and \"iCloud\".  So you just need to do it copy and paste one note at a time the old passion way.  This is no fun.\n\nA: Its very simple, try Airdrop, open the notes on iphone from which you wish to transfer it, tap on Share icon, tap \"AirDrop\", and simultaneously enable \"AirDrop\" from other iphone, choose \"Everyone\" ,and you are done with it.\nOnly drawback is that we have transfer notes one by one.\n\nA: Apple provides a web interface, so you can log in to https://icloud.com and see which notes are syncing.\nThen once you are logged in, go to one of the devices and sign out and back in with the same Apple ID. Check that the date is correct on the device before signing back in. At that point, go to the settings app and ensure notes are synced for iCloud. Also, update your iOS device unless you have a very good reason to not run the latest version of iOS on each device.\nOnce you have notes syncing from the web to the first device (and back) then you can repeat the same steps with the second device.\niCloud should sync notes to multiple iOS devices as long as you are using the same exact account and have signed in correctly. I've seen a wrong date cause delays or no syncing since the code has to know which device has the last version of each note to work.\n\nA: I used AirDrop to transfer the Notes (one at a time).  The source device had two Notes accounts, one of which was syncing and one local only.  The destination device had only one Notes account, which was syncing.  I transferred each Note using AirDrop from the source device local account to the destination device single account.  After syncing, the Notes appeared on the source device's synced account.\n\nA: *\n\n*iOS9.x\n\n*open notes \n\n*click on the right side \"refresh\" in the section ICLOUD\n\n*click next. let iOS9 upgrades your notes\n\n*now you can move your local notes to iCloud\n\n", "Q: Erased hard drive, trying to Reinstall Lion OS X...

If so, the phone has probably become locked again, and will only work with a SIM card after it has been unlocked once more.\nThis is because in some markets, phones are sold locked to a specific carrier, and will only work with a SIM for that carrier.

This will not give significant if any at all improvement in mac's performance, though.\nTo do it, just clean your home folder, but be careful not to remove the following folders:\n~/Applications\n~/Desktop\n~/Documents\n~/Downloads\n~/Movies\n~/Music\n~/Pictures\n~/Public\nAlso, you can remove all contents of all folders except ~/Applications to keep applications intact.\nNow let's move to actions which will actually help to improve the performance.\nMacs get slow for a reason. What's good about OS X is that you can always see this reason.\nOpen ActivityMonitor application which is within Utilities folder and sort the list by \"% cpu\" in descending order (two clicks onto column header). Now you see which applications consume most of CPU power. Probably the violator will be there. It is up to you whether to uninstall these apps or to keep them.\nNext, open Console, which is still within Utilities and look in All Logs section. If you see some king of logs dropping constantly with high speed that's another possible violator.\nNext, open Disk Utility and perform Check Disk and Check/Repair permissions. Sometimes helps.\n\nA: Mavericks creates a separate recovery partition on computers that can be accessed by holding Command+R while rebooting. Here's a webpage about that. If there isn't a recovery partition because you installed it this or that way, you can create one using Apple's Recovery Disk Assistant or this other method I found through Google. This partition can also be created on an external USB drive or a DVD, I think.\nAs for your apps, make a Time Machine backup and restore the ones you want individually. Most apps allow you to see your license key if you open the application and go under, for example Word > About Word on the menu bar (I know this worked for me with MS Word). If this doesn't work, just search for help on how to recover the license key. Any apps you installed from the app store can be downloaded again with your AppleID. Some apps will simply work if you just restore their application package and perhaps their library folders from the Time Machine backup.\nI did this with a 2008 MBP running Mountain Lion that I was about to give to a friend.

I assumed it worked much like system restore on my laptop.  After resetting the phone and following the instructions, I began the restore from a backup less than 12 hours old. I got a message saying that there was a problem with the backup and I should choose another source.  I attempted backups from all three most recent backups and got the same message. Is there anything besides a corrupted backup file that would cause this? I do have an iTunes backup but I haven't been as diligent about those since I thought that the iCloud backup was reliable. So if I restore to the iTunes backup I'll lose some data that I really don't want to lose (ideas, work notes, etc.) Thoughts? Suggestions?\n\nA: I've encountered a similar error on my iPhone 4S while restoring an iCloud backup. I fixed it by simply updating the firmware/iOS version to the latest version available from Apple. Latest iOS 7.1.2 was out at that time but I was running outdated iOS 7.0.4. Once the phone restored with the latest iOS version, I was able to restore from iCloud. So update your iOS if you're using an older iOS version and try again.   \n", "Q: Can I give something using my iTunes gift card?

I used Boot Camp Assistant to create a 200 GB BOOTCAMP partition on my 1 TB Fusion Drive.  I then rebooted and failed to install Windows because I did not know at the time that having my external backup drive plugged in would cause the Windows installer to not work.  From the Windows setup partition tool, I tried formatting the BOOTCAMP partition.  That did not help, so I tried deleting it and creating a new partition in its place.  That did not work either, which leads me to where I am now.\nI have a ~800 GB Macintosh HD partition and a 200 GB Free Space partition I need to get rid of to be able to give Boot Camp another go.

As I do not have root rights (university computer), I installed Xcode to modify the Makefile:\n#Base directory - adapt as needed\n# Unix:\nDESTDIR?=/Users/.../latex2rtf\n\nWhere ... is my home folder. Then I run the commands make; make check; make install (could not use sudo) and latex2rtf was installed to latex2rtf folder in my home directory. If I try to open latex2rtf file in bin folder, I get a new terminal window, where I can write anything without any kind of response. If I write latex2rtf in terminal I get a message: -bash: latex2rtf: command not found \nSo a simple question: how do I use latex2rtf on OS X in this case?\n\nA: Thanks to Mark for the solution, which was pretty basic, indeed:\nOpen your .bash_profile file in Home directory (you can use terminal to open it, or tick \"Show Hidden Items\" in Finder on OS X 10.9.4). Add following to it:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Users/.../latex2rtf/bin\nWhere the part after \":\" specifies the location of latex2rtf file.

I look into rack consoles and they look pricey for this particular work I'm doing. Do you know if I can turn my old MacBook Pro (early 2011) into one? \n\nA: Just a guess here but it sounds like he wants to use an old MacBook as a glorified KVM. Now Server rack KVMs have a connector that goes to the Keyboard, Mouse and Video port of every server.\nTo do something like this you would need a software controllable KVM switch as you cant plug all of those servers into your MacBook and switch between them without some sort of hardware. Even then I'm not sure you can view incoming video, I am inclined to think not but am not completely sure.\nOne thing you MIGHT be able to do is use RDP and/or VNC on the MacBook and then plug the MacBook into a small dedicated hub/switch that then goes to a \"spare\" ethernet port on your servers.\nMost servers have multiple ethernet ports and dedicating one to a \"soft KVM\" might work if they are not otherwise occupied.\nThe problem with that is that it is not strictly a KVM as it depends on the server's O/S being up and running, where a true KVM is nothing but a switch that connects directly to the server's keyboard, mouse and video ports. Allowing you to see and control the system from power on to power off, BIOS and other non O/S status messages included.\nSo for the TL;DR summary, probably not\n", "Q: What is the icon next to Spotlight in menu bar, and how to remove it?

However I am not 100% sure whether I can restore the backup made in step 2 on a RAID1 system. I assume it makes no difference as a RAID1 should be handled like a single disk by the OS.\nIs it possible to restore a backup from a single disk on RAID1?\n\nA: I believe it can be done but you lose the recovery partition and depending on your IT skills and willingness to start from scratch if the O/S gets hosed it might be a viable opportunity.\nNote that I have not done this with Mavericks or Time Machine.\nYou need to boot from an O/S install disk. you can make one out of an 8GB flash drive with the Mavericks installer app and a number of freely available tools. Once you have booted from the O/S installer flash drive, bring up disk utility and wipe the drives of all partitions. Delete them. Then under the RAID tab make a RAID out of those two disks and partition as you want. Probably just best to stick with one partition unless you have a specific need for more than one.\nOnce that is done you can install the o/s on the RAID and restore your apps/files/settings from the external disk.\nNote that I restored with a disk image using Carbon Copy Cloner from within disk utility, worked great but on an earlier O/S.

At least most of the time (possibly every time) I receive an .ics meeting invitation, the time is incorrect. This seems to be exclusively tied to time zone differences, but makes no sense.\nFor instance, I received an invitation yesterday from someone in California (PST). They had set the meeting for 08:00 their time. I am in EST (+3 hours). The invitation (and the resulting calendar item after I accepted) show as 10:00 for me. Clearly this is neither my time zone nor the originator's. When I look at the entry in iCloud, it shows a \"Floating\" time zone. I cannot change the time of the event in any of my tools (Outlook, iCloud, or iOS), presumably because it of restriction of permissions on events created from an invitation. I also cannot delete the item (without rejecting the invitation), so my only recourse has been to create a duplicate entry at the correct time, hoping I won't be confused by this in 6 weeks on the meeting date.\nIs there any way for me to handle these .ics invitations and have them end up showing properly in my calendar?\n\nA: http://lanyrd.com/help/timezones/\niPhone calendar settings live in Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -  select \"Time Zone Override\".\nI turned it off and it resolved the issue with the time zones\n", "Q: How to find the location of an opened file Imagine that I have two files of the same name in two different folders.

You can select a folder from the drop down to open it in the Finder.\n\n", "Q: Execute simple script I wrote the following very simple script:\n\nroute -n add 192.168.0.0/20 192.168.224.1\n  route -n delete 0.0.0.0\n  route -n add 0.0.0.0 172.20.10.1\n\nAnd would like to just double click it and you know... run it... on windows 8 i would just have to save as a .bat and right click it-> run as admin... How can i achieve similar behavior in mac osx (latest version)?\nExtra points if i can just double click it (cut the run under elevated mode)\n\nA: Instead of .bat, save it as .command.\nA .command file will run the contents of the file in Terminal upon double-click, just like a .bat would do on Windows.\nIf you can't run the file because you don't have permission to execute the command file, you need to set 'execute' on the file for it to allow you to run it:\nchmod u+x /path/to/file.command\n\nu is the owner of the file, +x adds 'execute', so u+x gives the owner of the file the ability to execute it\nAnd to the the commands as admin, OS X always requires you to put in the admin password. For your script, the easiest way to do this, is to run the script as an admin user and change the script to the following:\nsudo route -n add 192.168.0.0/20 192.168.224.1\nsudo route -n delete 0.0.0.0\nsudo route -n add 0.0.0.0 172.20.10.1\n\nsudo stands for Substitute User DO and runs as root by default.

Now I'd like to save it somewhere. (I could have piped it to a file, but I didn't think of that.)\nIs there an easier way to copy it all to the clipboard that by scrolling back and highlighting for pages?\n\nA: To capture your history of commands (but not their output):\nhistory > ~/Desktop/history.txt\n\nIf you want output as well, the shell command script works as well to capture while you type (but it captures key presses too, so watch out) or iTerm will have some option to save a session, like the stock Terminal's ⌘ + S.\n\nA: Oh, right, duh. ⌘ + A to select it all, then ⌘ + C.\n\nA: Click Shell -> Export text as...\nOr press ⌘ + S.\n", "Q: Always show text cursor while moving it in Word The text cursor, or caret, is normally in the visible form in applications at the start of its display cycle. It then goes to the flashing sequence once you stop moving it with arrow keys or typing. However, in Word 2011 I'm constantly frustrated because the cursor disappears, or defaults to the invisible state of the flashing sequence, while I'm typing or moving it. This makes it painfully difficult to edit text without using the mouse. As I write this post and keep going back to word I'm noticing that it seems erratic as to what behavior it's acting. I think that it stays in whichever state it was last in, which 50% of the time is invisible.\nI've since changed the blink rate to 200ms via changing the default in Word's plist file. This helps a little in my frustration, but the behavior really needs fixed.\nUpdate 2014-09-02\nIt doesn't appear to be a problem on documents created locally. It seems to be an issue with documents I've got from elsewhere, quite possibly from other operating systems.\n\nA: I noticed the problem when I tried working on a document I created working on a PC using Windows 8. So your theory on operating systems may be valid.\nI opened a blank document and copied the content out of the dysfunctional one and voila... my cursor came back. \n\nA: In my case, the copy/paste of the document did not work. But after a bunch of tries, I found a workaround:\nMove the mouse pointer outside the Table area!\nYeah I know it sounds weird. But if I use the keyboard arrows to move the cursor in a table cell while the mouse pointer is located inside that table, the cursor will annoyingly start disappearing.\nThis seems related to the Move icon appearing in the upper-left corner of the table when you move in the mouse pointer, which keeps switching on/off when you use the keyboard.\nBTW I'm using Word 2011 v14.4.8 (latest as of now).\n\nA: If it's not affecting locally created documents, could it have to do with Compatibility mode? Try re-saving the doc in the latest native .docx format and re-opening.\n\nA: I had the same issue but it was solved easy. \nYou are probably using a .docx extension if you save as your file to a .doc format the issue will go. I did not test but i think it will work if your original file is a .doc format and you save it as a .docx.  \n\nA: My screw up appeared to be from copy from gmail into word doc for mac yosemite, google search that worked was: copy the faulty doc into a new \"local\" file. fixed it.  \n", "Q: NeoOffice pay version vs free version Do you know if there are any features included in NeoOffice from AppStore but not included in the free version? I suppose not, because as OpenOffice is free software, NeoOffice must be too, so they should release their full work for free.\n\nA: From their website:\n\nNeoOffice 2014.1 Free Edition has the same features as NeoOffice in Apple's Mac App Store.\n  The only difference is that NeoOffice 2014.1 Free Edition cannot save documents.\n\nThe open source license that is used for the NeoOffice source code (GPL) doesn't require that the software be provided for free. It just requires that the source code be made available for free. NeoOffice do offer their source free, but it obviously requires a certain amount of skill and time to compile.\n", "Q: How to search Library on Mavericks Before updating to 10.9 I frequently deleted all the small files some apps leave behing by searching for invisible system files. Now it doesn't seem to work, I can navigate to the file manually just fine, but it doesn't show up in the search. Is there a way to index Library?\n\nA: Are you searching via command-f within Finder? If so, do you see a pair of dropdowns that say Kind is Any? Click Kind and select System files. Any will change to aren't included. Click it and change it to are included.\nIf System files isn't available in the first dropdown, select the last item, Other…, and find it in the subsequent popup. \nIf no dropdowns are shown, click the round + button on the right edge of the Finder window, near its top. \nIf you're searching via Menubar > Spotlight, I've looked in the past for a way to include hidden files in its search results, but to no avail. \nPersonally, I use App Cleaner, by the way, to tidy junk left by messy apps. \nADDENDUM: \nI see now this works for most Library files, like those found in Application Support or Internet Plug-ins, but it fails specifically for .plist files found in the Preferences sub-folder.

I've adjusted the balance in settings but the left side stays silent. I've tried many different headphones and its always the same. Any suggestions? \n\nA: I own a Shure headset with 3 connectors and it does not work on my MacBook Pro Retina 15''late 2013 nor does it with my iPhone 4S --- only the channel marked with 'left' works. And even the 4 connector versions are different among the various Notebook/Phone manufacturers compared to Apple. There are special Apple compatible versions advertised. Best, Peter\n\nA: does your headphone come with three electrical connectors at the plug or with for? The newer generations of MacBooks require 4 connectors to be able to play on both channels.

I usually run with the lid closed plugging into 2 Apple cinema displays. Everything works great, except when I accidentally bump the power cable, at which point it goes to sleep.\nIs there any way to prevent this? Clearly it isn't a power issue, because with the lid open and no power cable it drives all 3 monitors just fine.\n\nA: The power adapter is required for closed display mode on any Apple portable machine, without it you can't use closed display mode. \nReference:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3131\nThere is however a third party solution, called Caffine.  Which when enabled, forces the mac to stay on until the battery dies, it won't ever sleep.\nhttp://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/\n\nA: I was hoping to figure out how to do this with the pmset utility (man page).

Will I end up with a bunch of duplicates? Or will it import from my phone only any photos that weren't previously uploaded, for whatever reason, via photo stream?\n\nA: No duplicates will be uploaded to Photo Stream—only media that didn't get uploaded will be uploaded. This general rule also applies to photos transferred to other devices; the other device won't upload duplicates either.\n", "Q: No NTFS read support in OSX Mavericks? I recently upgraded my mac Mavericks at the same time as I swapped the hard drive for a new, larger capacity one, making for a fresh install (i.e. not an upgrade of the software). I kept the old hard drive, mounted it into an external caddy, and I am now trying to recover my files.\nThe issue I am having is that I cannot access (or even see) the old NTFS Boot Camp partition. I can access it with a windows laptop, so I know the partition is there and seemingly healthy. My mac can access the old HFS+ boot partition, but Disk Utility doesn't even identify the ntfs partition as existing. The disk has a GUID partition table if that makes any difference (I suspect that isn't the problem however, since it can see the size of the HFS+ partition).\n\nI am finding this to be a difficult problem to diagnose, as every search I attempt reliably informs me that all recent versions of OS X have read-only support for NTFS built-in, and thus most articles and forum posts are about how to enable write support. While writing to the disk would be nice, I only really need to be able to read from it for now.\n\nA: Mavericks does have read support for NTFS partitions enabled by default. However I doubt the problem is with the NTFS filesystem itself.\nMore likely the problem is with the partition table on the drive. If you are confident in the use of command line tools you can use TestDisk to attempt to locate and restore the missing NTFS partition. There is a detailed guide here on how to restore missing partitions.\nPLEASE NOTE: Before attempting this though I would backup all the data on that drive (using the Mac to backup the HFS+ partition and the Windows laptop you mention to backup the NTFS partition), as a misstep could result in losing both partitions.\n", "Q: Bought 2nd hand AppleTV, Privacy? I bought a second hand appletv. My main concern now is my privacy.\nWill the person from who I bought it from see what I am doing with it? Will he see when I try to log in using my appleId and see where I live and what I buy?\n\nA: I'd say it is very unlikely, but if you want to you can do a factory reset which will wipe the device settings, and also download and install the latest system software for your device.\nApple TV (2nd and 3rd generation): Restoring your Apple TV\n", "Q: Partition for iTunes I have a Mac with bootcamp and unfortunately i see myself using bootcamp far too often because I'm a developer and VS2013+SqlServer is way too demanding for my 8gb ram... but i use iTunes a lot... so i was thinking, if i create a Fat32 partition and put my iTunes folder there so i can point both my OSX iTunes and my windows iTunes and be able to not only read but write (app updates, new songs, etc...) will it work?!? or maybe the folder structure is different or something like that?!?\n\nA: You can use the same folder for Mac and Windows versions of iTunes. I would recommend use the exactly same version though. Here is more info on how use it through the network: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070424081346722. It's the same logic, but you will be using the same local folder instead a network shared one.\n\nA: No you cannot.

I restored my iphone 4s from a 1/2/2013 backup. Looks like I lost everything that was current like texts. Can I get it back to the state it was in before I restored it from that 2013 backup?\n\nA: Only if you have a more recent backup.\nDo you have iCloud Backup set up on the phone? If so, you most likely have a more recent backup on iCloud.\n", "Q: I don't have the apple ID on my iPod so I cannot delete iCloud? So I bought my iPod from someone, and their iCloud account is still on here, which means the pictures I take and everything, they can see. I just noticed this and I tried to delete it, but it asks me to put in a password to turn off \"find my iphone\" and I do not have that password because it is someone else's iCloud account.\n\nA: Your device is most likely Activation Locked. In order to remove the previous owner's Apple ID, you should try to get in contact with them and arrange to have them remove their ID from the device.\nActivation Lock is an anti-theft feature, so if you do a factory restore in iTunes, you will be prompted for the previous owners Apple ID password when the device activates during initial set up. At this point you won't be able to use the device anymore.\nHere are some Apple knowledge base articles that explain Activation Lock in a little more detail:\niCloud: Activation Lock: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13695\niCloud: Find My iPhone Activation Lock in iOS 7: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5818\n", "Q: How to tell VLC 2.3.0 to scan a local folder on an iPad I'm trying to load some of my son's favourites videos on his iPad (7.0.4).\nWhen I plug the iPad on my Linux Box (mint 17), the iPad folders are automatically mounted in read and write mode. So no problem to transfer the files on the iPad.\nStrangely enough though I can't get VLC to detect the files. It's a breeze on android's version of VLC but the IOS version of VLC has a different UI.\nAll sorts of ways are available (itune, wifi upload, dropbox and gdrive) but no way to scan a folder apparently.\nAm I missing something here?\n\nA: iOS does not expose its filesystem to apps, outside their own sandbox. As far as an app is concerned, the only files on the iPad (or iPhone, or iPod Touch) are its own files, in its own sandbox.\nYou can upload the files to VLC by either using 'open with' (from Dropbox or from other apps that expose the ability to open files in other apps), or by going to iTunes and copying the videos to the VLC app. This puts the files in VLC's own sandbox.\n", "Q: Why does my phone only turn on when it's plugged in? My iPhone 4 doesn't turn on unless it's plugged in. When it is plugged in, it briefly shows the Apple logo and then shows my lock screen. Where it should say Verizon and show how much signal I have, it only says searching. It also says my percentage is at 100% but I know it's really somewhere around 30-40% because that's how much charge it had before it turned off on me. Also, when I try turning on the wifi it tells me that the wifi networks are not available, but I have the wifi working at home. What does this mean, or what should I do?\n\nA: A common solution to this kind of problem is a complete restore (possibly in DFU mode). Before proceeding, make a backup of the entire content of your iPhone via iTunes or iCloud.\nThen, download the latest firmware available via iTunes. Charge the battery entirely before the restore, just to be sure that the iPhone won't shut down during the process.\nProceed by putting the iPhone in DFU; let then iTunes do the rest. \nI suggest you to DO NOT restore your iPhone from backup after finishing. Test everything, including Wi-fi connection. Install an app that shows you the actual battery cycles. Maybe replacing the battery could do the trick. If possible, try to connect to different hotspot; if the iPhone could not connect, maybe another problem is in the antenna.\nLet us know.\n\nA: Have you tried a reset?\nFrom Apple Support:\n\nHow to reset\nYou should reset your device as a last resort and only if you can't restart it.\nTo reset, press and hold both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo.\n\nSupport link with pictures: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1430\nIf that fails: Plan B is to take it to the Verizon store or Apple store.\n\nA: i suspect the battery connecter needs soldered back on the board.\n", "Q: Exchange Account on iPhone Without Unlock Pin My work exchange account forces me to use an unlock/passcode on my iphone. Is there any way to disable this?\n\nA: Read this thread for suggestions for things that you do - but be aware that if your employer has a policy that you shall have a passcode on your phone while connecting to their Exchange server, that it could involve written warnings and possible termination of employment if you are seen to be in contravention of the company's security policies.\nOptions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the Exchange mail account on the phone\n\n*Buy a beer for your friendly IT dude where you work (always stay friendly with these guys!), and get him to add you as an exclusion to the passcode requirement\n\n*Use a passcode\n\n\nYou should probably always use a passcode anyway, as without one your phone is worth a lot more to a thief (think of all that lovely personal data on there!).

I have been measuring my primary disk I/O with the following command :\n\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=2048k of=/Volumes/Toshiba/tstfile count=1024 2>&1 | grep > sec | awk '{print $1 / 1024 / 1024 / $5, \"MB/sec\" }'\n\nThis test is obviously for a write operation, read can easily be measured as well.\nBoth read and write give a speed of about 28MB/s which seems pretty poor, despite the age of my mac mini (2GHz core 2 duo).\nFurthermore, a 1TB usb 3 drive from last year gives the same performance, below 30MB/s always.\nI have tried changing the file size from 1MB to 500MB, results are consistent.\nSince both drives behave the same, i suspect a bottleneck somewhere else in the hardware or the software.\nWhat are the suggestions to investigate further?\nThanks\nNick\n\nA: My experience with dd is that as well as the file size, the block size makes a huge difference. Try playing with the bs parameter (try 128 - 10240) and see what sort of a difference it makes.\nAlso - a sustained 28MB/sec write speed is not all that bad for a 5-7 year-old computer. (Although if you multiply by 8 to get the speed in bits per second, you will see that it's 224mbps - around 15% of a SATA-I bus.)\nThings to consider include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the HDD a 5400rpm or 7200rpm model? For sustained larger file writes (as opposed to many small files), it makes a difference.\n\n*Not all HDDs are created equal, with some models being faster than others. Find out what model yours is and search a bit to find out how they usually fare.\n\n*Have you considered upgrading to an SSD? This will make a huge difference, even if the interface on the computer is only SATA-I (quite likely), as a decent SSD should be able to saturate the SATA bus.\n\n", "Q: Will everything be erased? And will I get caught? Ok so I updated and I restored my iPod so everything about cydia on my ipod will be erased? If I go to an airport will they be able to tell that my iPod was jailbroken?\n\nA: Nobody cares about jailbroken iOS devices.\nEven Apple only care if you take it for a warranty repair (as handing a jailbroken device to them and saying \"this doesn't work\" will probably get a response of \"well, you jailbroke it\").\nI would say relax and don't panic.\nTo answer the first part of the question, doing a system Restore will remove all traces of the jailbreak. It's MUCH harder to jailbreak an iOS device than it is to remove a jailbreak :)\n", "Q: Folders on top, on desktop Is it possible to get 'folders on top' on the desktop (too) by any plist file hack or third-party app?\nMy desktop (OS X Mavericks) is a bit cluttered and I've already sorted them on kind, but all .AI, .PSD, .INDD, .PNG, .JPG, .HTML files come first. I'm already able to sort them on top in Finder, via a third-party addon for Finder, but I need it even more on my desktop.\n\nA: You can sort your Desktop as you can do it with your Finder folder structure.\n\nJust sort by \"Tags\" and thats it:\n\n\nIn my tests, folders are showen before other files. \nBut of course, if you have Tags given, it gets sorted differently.\nSo three solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Give specific Tags and sort by Tags\n\n*Give non Tags and sort by Tags\n\n*Give your folder names starting with \"_\" or \"#\" and sorty by Name\n\n\nA: To make the folders come first in finder, change the order of data categories in spotlight.\nHit Command plus spacebar and then type spotl.  That opens spotlight preferences.  You will see all the data categories you have checked, or are checked by default.  Simply drag \"folders\" to the top of the list.  You can also arrange all the data categories in the order you want.  So when you are looking in Finder and opt to arrange by \"kind\"  the folder show up first together with any other changes in the order that you made.\nThanks to David Pogue's OSX Yosemite, the missing manual,  Page 132.\n\nA: This solution might sound to easy, but for me it works!\nSelect your entire hard drive in the Finder. Then click the view options:\nIn the next dialog select:\n\n\n*\n\n*Arrange by: None\n\n*Sort by: Kind\n\n\n\nNow (even whitout using the \"Kind\" fillering option), all your folders should show up first.

I'm using an iMac mid 2007 core 2 duo with the Western Digital 320Gb drive.\nConfusion has arisen due to my prior installation/update of Mavericks over one of my backup clones connected via firewire 800 - which is a doggy old IDE drive in an ancient icecube enclosure, and it works really well!!\nSo thinking that I might just clone my working external Mavericks to my internal drive, kick it in the guts and see how things work out - and it didn't.  Sat on the initial grey startup screen for 15 minutes before I got bored with the spinner and rebooted back to my working system.   What is going on?  I haven't been able to find any reference to required hdd specifications in documentation.  If my only option is to upgrade my internal disk then I will do it.  I was just just struck by the oddness of the refusal to ran on a particular disk.\nMy question is: Can I do anything about this reluctance to upgrade on my WDC WD3200AAJS?\n\nA: Usually when there's a problem with upgrading you have to \"re-bless\" the HDD. This often comes from a permissions problem with something on the HDD. You can open the Disk Utility and do a full permissions check to find any problems.\nIn my experience I've found the best way to accomplish this is to create a boot-able USB device using something like \"Disk Maker X\" and then boot from that. Once in the installer Open the Utilities and run Disk Utility from there. This will allow the permissions to be accessed from outside the disk, which helps since you won't have anything dependent on your log in. After the permissions are fully repaired try rebooting to the USB device and re-installing.\n", "Q: Run program if connected to specific wifi?

Just install the app, configure the places that you frequent, (home, work, a coffee shop, etc.) and never fuss with your settings again!\n\n\n\nA: wifi-location-changer is a project on GitHub which runs the shell script locationchanger every time the Wifi SSID changes. locationchanger sets the variable LOCATION and runs scselect \"$LOCATION\", you can replace that with your own action.\n\nA: You can use ControlPlane where you can set up rules to carry out tasks such as opening apps based on various criteria which includes connecting to Wi-Fi.\n\nControlPlane supports multiple contexts where a context is defined as a location or activity you are performing.  Using evidence sources you can create a set of rules that tell ControlPlane what context to apply to your environment.  When ControlPlane enters or leaves a context a set of Actions are performed.\n\nControlPlaneX, an unofficial fork of the open source project, has kept the project working to Mojave.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15\" late-2012 no input/output devices detected I did something silly. I replaced the trackpad in my MacBook Pro 15\" mid-2012. It (for some reason) involved taking the motherboard out (via iFixIt's instructions). Everything works now, except the sound.\nOS X reports no input or output devices. Nothing works, even when I plug headphones in. I'm not sure how OS X detects that a sound device is actually recognised, so I can't really troubleshoot the hardware. Any ideas?\nI've tried all the usual, reset PRAM, SMC, etc.\n\nA: I can't be sure, but I think that the first step to solve the problem is to check the connection of speakers to motherboard. Are they connected properly? Disassemble the laptop and check all the loops and wires.\n", "Q: Endless loop of iCloud prompt rendering iPad unusable I hadn't used my iPad in some time, and recently tried powering it back on.  As soon as iOS starts up, I am prompted to enter my iCloud password. My home WiFi network has changed since the last time I used the iPad, so there is no internet access.  The iPad won't accept what I believe to be the password for my Apple ID the last time I used it (I have since changed it, but imagine it's expecting me to enter a cached password since the device hasn't been in contact with Apple's servers in some time).\nI'm unable to connect to my new WiFi network since the iCloud prompt appears every second after hitting cancel.  Is there any way out of this loop?  I've tried restoring the device via iTunes, but it tells me that that Find my iPad has to be disabled before doing a restore (which, of course, requires entering the iCloud password).\n\nA: I found a (much less than satisfactory) solution to the problem.  There is a slight delay between when pressing \"cancel\" on the iCloud password prompt and when the next popup opens.  I was able to navigate to the WiFi settings, and after a lot of frustration, was able to connect to my new wireless network.  After doing so, the prompt accepted my updated password.  Quite annoying.\n\nA: Of course, in the future, you could just temporarily change your wifi back to the old settings that match the iPad, allow it to connect, and then when complete, change your wifi back to the new settings.\n", "Q: How to number pages in pdf document?

Arma dei Carabinieri - Attenzione! Il Suo computer personale è stato bloccato per I've a MacBook Pro and Mavericks. My browsers are blocked by ramsonware. It asks 100 $/Euro and says that your computer is blocked by the Italian cops and constantly redirects you to a fake page.\n\nI've tried to remove it resetting Safari and Chrome, but the virus is still alive.\nWhat should I do to remove this thing?\n\nA: Here is a link for removing ransomware on a Mac.\nit's pretty easy:\nhttp://www.thesafemac.com/fbi-ransomware-virus-rampant/\nFrom the post:\n\nThere have been many reports among Mac users recently of being “infected” with an FBI ransomware “virus,” telling them that their computer has been seized and that they have to pay money to get it unlocked. Fortunately, from the reports I’ve been getting, there is no indication that this is actually Mac malware of any kind. It’s simply an obnoxious browser pop-up, displayed via JavaScript, in an attempt to fool people into paying.\nI have yet to see this behavior first-hand, but it’s undoubtedly being caused by JavaScript that has been injected into legit sites, either through malicious ads or by hacking the site. Keep in mind that the old wisdom that you’re fine if you avoid “bad” sites is no longer particularly good. Most malware these days is distributed through legit sites, so any site could potentially fall victim.\nforce quit Safari\nThe question, then, is what to do if you see this pop-up. If you cannot close the window or the browser, then you will need to force the browser to quit. Press command-option-esc to display the force quit window. In that window, make sure your web browser is selected, then click the Force Quit button. Once the browser quits, you can close the force quit window.\nDepending on your browser and/or system settings, your browser may try to reload the pages that were open the last time it quit. This could cause the problem to recur immediately, as soon as you open your browser again. In Safari, you can avoid this by holding down the shift key while opening the app.\nOnce you have your browser open again, you should be fine. You could clear your cookies and browser cache if you like, but that really won’t be particularly useful. Contrary to popular belief, this will not cure such problems or prevent them from occurring.\n\n\nA: I've solved my problem deleting all the files related to Chrome/Firefox with AppCleaner and restoring Safari. Also i've changed my DNS settings using the ones from Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).\n", "Q: Location not loading When I try to change my location for the App Store, it wint load. i go to fetured, my apple id thing, put in my password and everything, but when i click on the country/region button to change it, the page won't load.

I'd like to create a new Favorites folder item in the Finder, how can I tell the Finder that I would like a particular folder to appear in my list of Favorites shown on the left hand sidebar of the Finder window and in dialogs to open a file in an application?  I expected to find this in the Finder's Preferences, but the Sidebar tab of the preferences only allows you to toggle the visibility of your existing Favorites, not add new ones.  I see that applications like DropBox are able to extend this Sidebar, so what about an end user, how can I extend it?\n\nA: To enhance the accepted answer, paraphrase another, correct one more and to add my own input, I offer the below summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag and Drop\n\nDragging and dropping the folder use to work for me, but seems to be largely hit and miss these days. For me I'm usually adding network folders and these sometimes don't drag too well. If it does, and the horizontal bar appears in Favourites where you would like, then well and good. If not, try the following options:\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: CTRL+CMD+T\n\nThe Old keyboard shortcut use to be CMD + T but that got dropped when Finder introduced tabs. That now opens a new tab. The keyboard shortcut has become CTRL+CMD+T.\n\n*Finder \"File\" menu\n\nThere is an option on the finder menu to \"Add to Sidebar\" (and you can see the keyboard shortcut listed to the right)\n\n\nWhen the above don't work\nOften I find that I can't drag and drop the folder to the sidebar and this can be frustrating, and going to the File menu sees the \"Add to sidebar\" as disabled or greyed out. But if you use the shortcut in this scenario, it should still work (it has worked for me just now under El Capitan). \nAlso, the \"hack\" within these answers of \"drag and drop a subfolder and press escape\" trick has also allowed me to add it. (Thanks @LWTBP, I didn't know this method before tonight). \nFor me, the scenario was:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I had a network share I wanted to add to Favourites\n\n*I'd brought up the particular folder in the navigation area of Finder but every time I dragged it to Favourites, it would only allow me to Drop it onto an existing folder\n\n*I opened the carat to a subfolder and attempted to drag that in and the horizontal bar appeared\n\n*I pressed ESC, re-selected the parent folder and dropped it in the desired Favourites position\n\n*And all was right with the world :)\n\n\nA: Sometime a folder might not show the \"horizontal location-line\" graphic as you drag it into the sidebar, making it impossible to attach it to the sidebar. In such situations, you can drag a folder within the folder into the sidebar and cancel that action (press 'esc', etc.) once you see the location line graphic. Then try dragging the main folder again onto the sidebar again—it will work.\n\nA: Drag the folder to the desired position in the sidebar. This adds the folder to the sidebar in every current and future Finder window, as well as Finder Open/Save windows/sheets.\n\nRemoval is done by dragging the folder from the sidebar out to the side.\n\n\nA: Select folder you are intending to add to side bar and just type ⌘ CMD+T.\n\nA: I accidentally 'dumped' my google folder from my Favorites menu but managed to re-add it by opening a google folder window, then taking the little icon at the top of the window and just dropping back into Favorites. \n\nA: If you've got a network share that you can't drag&drop onto the Favorites, go look for it under /Volumes/ShareName and drag that instead.\n\nA: Opening the folder and then dropping the icon from the header worked best for me as cmd drop only adds a link and not the actual folder-a very important distinction.\n\nA: [mac OS Sierra] I needed to add a folder in my user directory - /Users/sean/workspace/ - which I couldn't find in a Finder window. Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Click File > New Smart Window*\n\n*In the search field at top right, enter 'workspace' (or your folder name)\n\n*Verify desired folder (blue icon) appears in the results\n\n*Drag the folder into the Favorites in the left sidebar\n\n*Discard the smart window\n\n\n*Regular windows, even Smart Window via system tray Finder icon don't work.\n", "Q: I have an iphone 4 with ios7 and I don't have any camera filters or different camera options I updated my phone and It updated everything expect my camera.

But my iPad is working fine. I didn't change any setting in iPhone, when I try to connect, it shows busy icon and that's it. \nWhat can be wrong?\n\nA: This probably happens because some of the wireless settings have gone wrong.

I have a 16gb iPad 2. Most of the space is taken up by games and it's hard figuring out what games I want to remove to open up space. Is there a way to transfer the games wirelessly to an external hard drive? I know on Android, you can transfer games to a micro sd card. Not sure if it's possible on an iOS device.\n\nA: No, unless the device is jailbroken.

I.E. We want it to be deleted.\nWhen I try and sync all her music on the laptop, it complained that there was not enough space even though her entire library is less than half the phone's capacity.\nSyncing an existing album duplicates the album inside Music.\nSyncing a new albums copies over the new album and that is manageable through iTunes.\nNo existing music can be deleted.\nWhen I check \"Manually manage music and videos\", none of the existing music appears.\nAt the moment I have the following options checked:\n\nSummary\n\n*\n\n*Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected\n\n\n*Sync only checked songs and videos\nSync music\n\n*\n\n*Selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres\n\n*\n\n*<Selected a new album>\n\n\n\n\nThe following questions do not help.\n\n*\n\n*iTunes sync does not delete songs\n\n*How can I remove unchecked and deleted songs in iTunes from my iPhone?\nDevice info\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 4\n\n*iPhone iOS 7.1.2\n\n*iTunes for Windows - just downloaded from website, I assume it is the latest but I cannot find \"About\"\n\n\nA: I had the exact same issue when setting up a new computer—frustrating. What's happening is that iTunes sees that the current songs on the iPhone are taking up a lot of space, but iTunes is unable to figure out that many of the songs that are already on the iPhone are the same ones that are in your iTunes. Instead of syncronizing it to make all the songs match, it's saying there isn't enough space on the iPhone to add all of the songs in your iTunes library.\nBased on a couple of posts I read on the web, I just tried this solution and it worked: \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have all of your songs organized the way you want them in iTunes on your computer.\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer and sync your iPhone with iTunes, but on the music tab in iTunes, uncheck \"sync music.\"  Set up all your other synchronization settings as you want them (Calendars, Contacts, Photos, Podcasts, etc). This way everything but your music will be correctly synched between your iTunes and iPhone. Once you have iTunes set to sync, click \"Apply\" in lover right corner of iTunes. This will sync everything except your music.\n\n*Next, you need to erase all of the songs on your iPhone. If there are any songs on your iPhone that aren't in your iTunes, you'll lose them, but that wasn't the case with me. To erase songs on iPhone, go to Settings → General → Usage → Manage Storage → Music → Edit (top right of screen). Click the red \"-\" to the left of \"all songs\" and tap delete.  Scary, but this will delete all songs on the iPhone itself.\n\n*Not sure if it's necessary but I restarted my iPhone after this.\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer.  Click on the little iPhone icon in the top left of the iTunes screen, and then click the Music tab in iTunes.  Put a check in the box by \"Sync Music\" and then select whether you want to sync your entire library or selected playlists, artists, etc.  Once you've selected what you want to sync, click on \"Apply\" in the bottom right corner of iTunes.\n\n\nThis will dump all of your iTunes songs/playlists back into your iPhone.\n", "Q: in terms of battery life for the iphone 5, which battery is better? 3.8v1440mAh or 3.8v1560mAh? ok so if I have this right milli Amp hour= mAh, Whr = Watt hour, and v = Volt is charge capacity? Where is potential discharge or work capacity and V is the rate at which the \"work\" is being done?\n\nA: The battery life of your iPhone depends on it's usage. 1440mAH or 1560mAH refers to the basic term that if your phone uses 1mA per hour(i.e 1 W/v) it can last for 1440 hours. But the usage will depend on what all software you are using. Like mobile network and heavy graphic intense games will use more power, applications that don't require a lot of processor power to work,(such as a clock) will not take so much amount thus you will have a longer battery life.\nThere are various articles explaining this online, if I find a suitable one I will post it in an edit soon.\n\nA: You have a skewed understanding from what I can tell. This may be a bit overkill, but some simple physics couldn't hurt. Let's start with the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Voltage, measured in Volts (V), is the potential energy of electrons between to points. It is analogous to pressure in pipes.\n\n*Current, measured in Amperes (A), is the rate at which electrons flow, equivalent to 1 Coulomb per 1 second (1 C/s, 6.241×10^18 electrons per second). It is analogous to the flow rate of water in pipes (the volume of water that flows by per unit of time, e.g. Litre/second).\n\n*Power, measured in Watts (W), is the rate at which electrons flow, multiplied by the potential energy of each electron. It is equivalent to a Volt Ampere (VA). I.e. 1 Amp of current at 1 Volt potential is 1 Watt of power.\n\n*Energy, measured in Joules (J), is the product of the power multiplied by the time over which it was applied. It is equivalent to 1 Watt Second (WS). I.e. 1 Watt of power being consumed for 1 second is 1 Joule.\n\n*Charge, measure in Ampere-Hours (Ah), is the product of the current flowing by how long it has been flowing for, regardless of voltage.\nMultiplying charge by voltage gives you the Voltage-Ampere-Hours (VAh). From above, we can see that Voltage-Amperes are the same as Watts, so this gives us Watt-hours (Wh). Watt-hours are a measure of power, multiplied by a measure of time, which we've also established is Energy\nA milliampere-hour has 3 parts: \"milli\" denotes that the quantity is 1 thousandth of the base unit, \"Ampere-hour\", which is a unit of charge.\nAt the same voltage, charge is proportional to energy stored in a battery.\nWe can run the simple calculations:\nBattery 1)\n3.8 V * 1440 mAh\n= 3.8 V * 1.4 Ah (milli denotes 1/1000th)\n= 5.32 VAh (multiply the values)\n= 5.32 Wh (VA is the same as a W)\n= 5.32 Ws * 3600 (3600 seconds in an hour)\n= 19,152 Ws\n= 19,152 J (Ws are the same as a J)\n\nBattery 2)\n3.8 V * 1560 mAh\n= 3.8 V * 1.56 Ah (milli denotes 1/1000th)\n= 5.928 VAh (multiply the values)\n= 5.928 Wh (VA is the same as a W)\n= 5.928 Ws * 3600 (3600 seconds in an hour)\n= 21,340.8 Ws\n= 21,340.8 J (Ws are the same as a J)\n\nAs you can see, the second battery holds ~11% more energy than the first.\n", "Q: Is it safe to keep iPhone's Hotspot on? I want to keep my laptop tethered to my phone's connection and was wondering if it is safe to keep emitting the personal hotspot wifi signal all day and anywhere I go (underground station, work, busy streets etc). Or would that have a risk of intrusion ?\nMy personal hotspot is password protected.\n\nA: If you've password protected the network, the only worry you should have is battery life on the phone providing the hotspot.  You could also use a password with more entropy bits, but which is easier to remember. I would hazard a guess that not many folks are actively trying to crack random personal hotspots on the tube, walking around the park, grabbing an eel pie, or whatnot. I would suggest that if you remain concerned about it, just turn it off! You will certainly be saving some battery power and not zapping your gonads with wifi radiation, especially if you carry your phone in a pants pocket.\n\nA: If you're concerned about Wifi cracking, you can disable Wifi on your phone. Hotspot will prompt you if you'd like to turn it on or not, but if you leave it off, tethering will only function over USB or Bluetooth.\nThe opportunity and ability to crack Bluetooth is significantly harder.\nUSB is quite easy if you leave your computer unattended. Difficult otherwise.\n", "Q: Why are my top-row keyboard buttons not working on Mac Lion? A kid tampered with System Preferences on my Mac Air running Lion, and now, none of the top-row keyboard buttons work. For instance, altering screen brightness, toggling the dashboard, and altering volume don't work.\nThere does seem to be some mismatch though. For instance, pressing the eject button now takes me to the dashboard.\nHow can I restore the default functionalities of the top-row keyboard buttons?\n\nA: If you check the Keyboard pane in System Preferences, you should see an option called Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys. I think you'll find it checked. The default is to have it unchecked.\nThen within the Mission Control pane in System Preferences, I think you'll find that \"Show Dashboard\" is set to F13. The default is F12 (note that the default doesn't work if Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys isn't checked).\n\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue but the Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys checkbox did not make any difference. What worked for me was resetting the SMC.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup accidentally unplugged, can't repair I accidentally removed my Time Machine backup without ejecting. It didn't show up in Finder after I plugged it back in and Disk Utility cannot repair it. Disk Utility recommends reformatting the disk, but I want to make sure I'm doing it right. I don't really care about restoring the files because they are just old backups of my stuff (I only need a backup that works!)\nIn Disk Utility, I have a listing called \"750.12 GB WD My Passport\" and under that, I have a partition called \"My Passport\". I tried to Erase the \"My Passport\" partition, but Disk Utility couldn't find it. So now do I try to erase everything under the 750.12 GB WD My Passport option? \nI'm pretty confident that the drive is not dying because it happened after I removed it without ejecting. \n\nA: Yes. Reformat and partition the HD. When you unplugged the drive, you severely damaged the directory information on the 'My Passport' partition, rendering it unusable. If there is nothing of value on the drive, this is your best bet.

How do I get the iphone to have the same email as the server?\n\nA: POP mail servers do not synchronise their data between devices in the way IMAP does. \nEach device will download any mail in the queue when asked & will not auto-delete anything, except for any set server timeout interval, which is adjustable from Mail on the Mac or from iDevice - Settings > Mail, Contacts… > [the email account] Advanced > Delete from Server…\nOther than that, deletion once downloaded is manual, per device.\n", "Q: Can I control my Mac with my iPhone -- over Bluetooth? There are about nine thousand apps that will allow me to use my iPhone to control my Mac over wifi. \nI just moved, and I don't have an internet connection in the new place yet. Additionally, I can't tether with my iPhone's connection (thanks to my carrier's rules). \nCan I turn my iPhone into a Bluetooth trackpad somehow? This would need to be a standalone solution on my phone, since for obvious reasons I can't download client software onto the Mac. \n\nA: I don't know of a general purpose Bluetooth only control that exists on the App store (but that store is really hard to search these days for a needle in the haystack of apps), but one of the more common remote control software packages does say it will work without WiFi on the Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.airkeyboardapp.com/faq#no-wifi\nOnce you've installed the free Mac software and tested that you are OK tethering the Mac to the phone (which can use prodigious amounts of cellular data) you can download the free and ad supported iOS app.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/air-keyboard-free-wireless/id541873446?mt=8\nThere is IAP to remove the ads if you really like it over time. I prefer to use the computer's create network and tether over USB if needed for control in situations where I don't have a pre-existing WiFi network. The apps I prefer for that are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touchpad by Martian Craft - about $7 on the app store\n\n*Rowmote Pro by Evan Schoenberg - about $5 on the app store\nTouchpad is truly standalone, just turn on screen sharing on your Mac and run the app. Rowmote Pro is more integrated with various apps such as spottily, hulu, etc... Both function fabulously as a keyboard and mouse/trackpad for OS X from iOS and I find I use both for different tasks at different times.\n\nA: If your iOS device is jailbroken, you can install WeBe++.\nThis app can be used in Bluetooth HID mode which means that no software is required on the Mac to 'receive' the mouse input. This is what requires the jailbreak and why apps that do this in this way won't be found on the App Store. WeBe++ uses BTstack, a separate Bluetooth stack that gives more possibilities to tweak developers—BTstack will temporarily disable Apple's Bluetooth to override it into HID allowing representation of mice/keyboards, meaning no software is required on the Mac. WeBe++ supports clicking as well as scrolling, but no multi-touch gestures.\nThe Wi-Fi apps that are available require software to be installed on the Mac regardless of whether Wi-Fi is present or an Ad-Hoc network is created. If you can manage to get software installed on the Mac to connect to Wi-Fi mice apps, then you can create an Ad-Hoc network to connect your iOS device to. Go to the AirPort menu bar item and create a network. Apps that work over Wi-Fi will work over an Ad-Hoc network, so this may be something you could set up for future necessity.\n", "Q: How to install wifi in Macbook Pro Currently I am using a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.8.5 and I just noticed that there is no Wi-Fi option on this machine.\nTo try to add Wi-Fi to the menu bar, I went to System Preferences → Network and clicked the \"+\" button from the left list, and in the interfaces section I found nothing named Wi-Fi!\nI also tried to search for \"wifi\" in Spotlight, but there is nothing named like that.\nI'm wondering if somehow the software is not installed in this machine. I don't know whether this software comes with the OS X installation or not.\n\n\n\nA: I had the same issue and finally found a fix!!\nNot only did I NOT have wifi, but I didn't even have an option for \"wifi\" under network preferences.  When clicking the (+) under network preferences I only got options for Firewire, Ethernet, Bluetooth DUN, VPN PPPoE, and 6 to 4. \nI tried a number of \"fixes\" including terminal commands to manually turn the airport power off and on again, deleting the existing wifi option (the one that wouldn't turn On) using the (-) button, and restarting my mac numerous times both in Mac OS and my bootcamp Windows OS. \nFinally, i fixed this issue doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac. \n\n*upon start-up, hold down the Opt key until you see your drives. \n\n*click on the recovery drive (note: this will not affect or delete any files you currently have). \n\n*login if needed. \n\n*in the top right hand corner you will see the Wi-Fi icon (hopefully). Click the icon and then click \"turn wifi Off\" and then again click \"turn wifi ON\" \n\n*restart your Mac again and start it up normally. \n\n*recover from your near-heart attack\n\n\nPlease let me know if this worked. \n\nA: You could have a hardware problem with your network card.\nWhen there is no wifi hardware installen/found on the mac, I would go to an apple store or authorised service provider to have this problem fixed. When your mac is still in warrenty, it normally is free to repair.\nWhen it is out of warranty I would first call Apple care to see if they will repair as a gesture of goodwill.\nYou will get a case ID than.

I searched for 'T' and there's no Tumblr!\n\nMaybe it's bit blurry, but there's all the apps which started with T. I've searched in the search Spotlight too but also, nothing appears with 'Tumblr'.\n\nA: Reboot the device by holding both the power and home button until the Apple logo is shown. This will reset the SpringBoard cache which should show the app on the home screen if it's been downloaded (and in Spotlight).\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup to drive shared on BTHomeHub3? I have a Freeagent GoFlex Drive hooked up to my BTHomeHub3 router. My Desktop PC is backing up to it fine but I'm having troubles with Time Machine.\nMy Mac can mount the drive perfectly fine and use it but it won't show up in time machine's list of disks.\nI've enabled showing unsupported volumes on my Mac to try and make it appear but it won't appear.\nAny ideas how I can get it to show up in Time Machine?\n\nA: For Time Machine to back up to a disk, the disk must be formatted as Mac OS Extended to allow for the hard links and other special metadata that Time Machine uses. However, the BT Home Hub doesn't let you share such a disk over the network (haven't tried the new 5, but I know the 3 doesn't let you). This means you need to set up a sparse bundle on the disk to contain the backup. This should be done automatically, but as with everything relating to the awful BTHHs, it won't happen—afaik the Home Hub uses a non-standard method for sharing network disks. Whilst you may be able to get it working by creating your own sparse bundle using Disk Utility, then mounting that and using that as your backup destination, I wouldn't trust my backups over it.\n", "Q: How to create your own wifi network in mac without internet cable I want to create a network in my room with my mac. I have low wifi signal in my room and my ipad cannot detect it but my mac can. However, I am using a retina mac and thus cannot connect the ethernet cable. Is there any way that I could partition my air port to create a network while connected to my home wifi? \nFYI I am using a late 2013 retina macbook pro with the OS X mavericks\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't use your Macbook to extend your wireless network in this way. It seems to only be able to connect to an existing Wi-Fi network or create its own. It can't extend an existing Wi-Fi.\nThree options are:\n1) Purchase a Thunderbird to Ethernet adapter so you can connect the Macbook to the network over ethernet and then share the ethernet connection over wireless.\n2) Connect your iPad to your Macbook by USB cable and then share the Wi-Fi connection over \"iPhone USB\".\n3) Share the Wi-Fi connection on your Macbook over \"Bluetooth PAN\". This last one is probably the most attractive as it doesn't involve using a cable of some sort.\n", "Q: Fix Terminal error message \"-bash: /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh: No such file or directory\" I am trying to remove the following Terminal error message:\n-bash: /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh: No such file or directory\n\nI recently uninstalled RVM (Ruby Version Manager) from my MacBook Air. The terminal error appeared after I finished the RVM uninstall. The error appears every time I launch Terminal. My troubleshooting so far (seaching google etc.) lead to suggestions to modify my bash files. I have checked the two files listed below and found nothing pointing to \"/etc/profile.d/rvm.sh\"\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n\nAm I missing a bash file that is causing the error? I was assuming the error had to stem from one of those two files listed above, but obviously I was wrong.\n\nA: You should also look at /etc/profile file, as it may have references to /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh. \nIt's also worth it to read the manual for bash, as it lists all files bash will look at for configuration. This will be towards the end of the man page. To read it, in Terminal.app type man bash.\nFinally, you can run, again in Terminal.app, the following command: \ngrep -R 'rvm.sh' /etc\n\nThis will look for all files inside /etc, recursively, that contain rvm.sh text in them.\n\nA: cd /etc/profile.d/\nls\n\nthe output will contain a file such as vte-XXX.sh\njust type\ncp vte-XXX.sh vte.sh\n\n", "Q: open multiple files in one emacs window I can open a file in emacs with this command:\nopen -a Emacs main.cpp\n\nBut when I apply the same command to multiple files\nopen -a Emacs main.cpp test.cpp\n\ntwo emacs windows will appear. I would like to open them\nin the same emacs window, is this possible?\n\nA: Instead of starting Emacs with open you can use emacsclient to send files to an already running Emacs. For this to work you need to start the corresponding server inside emacs by including\n(server-start)\n\nin your emacs init file.\n", "Q: Apple Map App for use as GPS on my iPad air.

I've begun downloading LaTeX and the download is 2GB. My MacBook Air has a 4GB 1600 Mhz DDR3 memory and a 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 processor. Will this large download have any impact of the long-term performance of my laptop considerably?\n\nA: Adding application software will have no effect on the performance of your computer unless 1) the software is running or 2) it installs persistent background processes that consume resources. LaTeX does not do #2, so you need not worry that this will affect your computer in any negative way.\n\nA: No, the speed differences should be unnoticeable as the data will be written to disk as it is downloaded. The only noticeable change may be in your internet speed as the download consumes bandwidth.\n", "Q: How to locate UI Button for AppleScript using Accessibility Inspector There are several articles here that address this question, but none offer the help to connect-the-dots.\nThe attached screen shot shot shows Accessibility Inspector for the button in question, which answers to 'process java'. It also shows the properties of the window (bottom) and 2 code strings to have AppleScript press the continue button. These are:\nif exists (button \"Continue\" of window 1) then\n    click button \"Continue\" of window\nelse if exists (button \"continue\" of window 1) then\n    click button \"continue\" of window 1\n\n\nI am almost certain 'tab' and 'space bar' might work for this. But, can it be done through the window? If so, how?\nEDIT: Tried to get info about the buttons with:\n get every button of window 1 of process \"java\"\n    --> {button 1 of window \"Security Warning\" of application process \"java\",\n         button 2 of window \"Security Warning\" of application process \"java\",\n         button 3 of window \"Security Warning\" of application process \"java\"}\n\nIt appears the buttons are 'close, zoom & minimize'. (upper left 3 dots)\n\nA: To get information about UI elements in Accessibility Inspector, you just need to hover the mouse over whichever UI element you want to know more about. For the purposes of closing this security warning, you need to be able to identify which button and which window. So if you hover the mouse over the title bar of the window you can see the AXValue is \"Security Warning\". And if you hover over the Continue button you can see the AXTitle value is \"Continue\".\nFrom this you can create the following AppleScript which will close this dialog...\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"java\"\n    click button \"Continue\" of window \"Security Warning\"\nend tell\n\nAlso you can get AppleScript to tell you the actual names of the buttons in the window with. Please note that it will list the three standard Close, Minimise, Maximise traffic light buttons in the top left corner as well.\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"java\"\n    get name of every button of window \"Security Warning\"\nend tell\n\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Bulk conditional file name change I've been doing a lot of organising of my files using terminal commands (mostly for further terminal education).\nI've learned about bulk renaming in terminal, e.g. replacing all underscores with spaces, bulk case changes, etc.\nWhat I'm trying to do now is insert a character, or set of characters, either in a specific place in the file name or conditionally.\nEssentially I'm trying to add a hyphen \"-\" between the track number and title of a list of audio files.\nSo where I have:\n\"01 First Track.mp3\"\n\"02 Second Song Title.mp3\"\n\"03 Third.mp3\"\n\"04 Fourth and Final One.mp3\"\nI'd like to replace the \" \" in the third position to be \" - \", leaving:\n\"01 - First Track.mp3\"\n\"02 - Second Song Title.mp3\"\n\"03 - Third Thing.mp3\"\n\"04 - Fourth and Final One.mp3\"\nIs there a way to append a character conditionally?  Say, check for a number (anything between 0-9), and replace the character directly after with another character?  Logically:  for i in *; if $i === \"0-9\" and + === \" \" replace + with \" - \"   .... something like that?\nAlternatively, could I just point to the third position of the file name and insert \"- \"?\nThe problem with simply replacing ALL \" \" with \" - \" is that this would replace each space in the file name with a hyphen.\nPerhaps there is a way to only consider the first instance of the \" \" in the file name and ignore later instances?\nBut I'd like to learn if there is a way to replace characters conditionally.\nI've been googling with:\n\"terminal bulk replace character conditional\"\n\"unix batch file name conditional\"\nand similar, but so far have only found character removal/replacement, or plain appending (i.e. replace all X with Y, or for each file, append a sequential number to the beginning).\n\nMany thanks.\n\nA: You probably want to use regex for this. Depending on the version of your question, it's pretty straightforward. There are a number of good sites to get started on the basics. In a sense, you already have seen a little taste of it: the \"*\" in \"*.mp3\" is a regex concept (meaning 'match any symbol 0 or more times'). Try something like (https://www.debuggex.com) or (http://www.regexr.com).\nThe simple version of your question is actually very simple indeed, so you might get away with just this approach:\necho '01 ab cd.mp3' | sed 's/ / - /'\n\nThis sed command is basically a regex-defined find and replace. It finds ' ' and replaces it with ' - ', the first time only. (Much more on sed here: https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#The-_0022s_0022-Command)\nI would also be surprised if there weren't a number of scripts and things specifically for processing mp3 filenames that will already do this for you, but there's no reason you can't do it yourself in Terminal.\n", "Q: How to interface with iOS lockdownd I used nmap to portscan my iPod Touch, and found a single port open, which was port 62078, labeled as \"iphone-sync\". I did some research, and found that the proccess behind it was a program called  \"lockdownd\" which could be used to interface with the iPod.\nI was wondering if and how I could use this to interface with and possibly control my iPod.\n\nA: Port 62078 is the port on which the iOS lockdown daemon listens on. Normally it is interacted with via usbmuxd which is a protocol that allows arbitrary TCP connections to be made over a USB connection.\nlockdownd can be used to do a lot of nifty things with the built-in services Apple expose on unjailbroken devices. The goto library for interfacing with this service seems to be libimobiledevice which is an open-source library implementing the usbmuxd and other iOS protocols. For a better overview of the capabilities of lockdownd and the iMobileDevice library, take a look at some of the packaged tools the library provides. If you know C, the source code for these tools is here.\n\nA: Obviously (and someone has already mentioned this in a comment), it can be used for syncing the device over WiFi because iTunes does it.\nHowever, the interface is undocumented, and as such unsupported by Apple.\nAnother option, if you are looking at controlling the device remotely and generally having fun with it, would be to jailbreak it and writing your own control software that would run on the phone. That would allow you to connect over an interface you would create yourself.\nSuch software may even already exist in the jailbreak community.\n", "Q: Is there any way to use iBooks author like pages/numbers/keynote on icloud?

If you want to create a new background with an image you import, make sure you pull down the divider on the sidebar and add the image to the MASTER slide. Then you can save the theme. I tried saving the theme before doing this and couldn't figure out why it still looked like the old theme when I opened the new one.\n", "Q: Apps for making geometric shapes (math) Is there any apps for making geometric shapes (math)?

What are some things that I should try?\n\nA: From iPhone and iPod touch: Charging the battery:\n\nIf your battery doesn't charge, or if your device shows a low-battery image, black screen, or \"accessory not supported\" alert, follow these steps.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Inspect the connector at the bottom of the phone:\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that there are no bent pins in the connector.\n  \n*Make sure that the connector is free from debris.\n  \n*If there are bent pins or debris, please contact Apple Support.\n  \n  \n*Otherwise, continue troubleshooting.\n  \n*Make sure that the outlet you're using works.\n  \n*Make sure that the Apple USB cable and Apple USB power adapter work.\n  \n*Plug the device in to power and let it charge until your device turns on. This could take between 10 and 30 minutes. If you don't have an Apple USB power adapter, try connecting to a computer's high-power USB 2.0 port (not a keyboard). The computer must be on.\n  \n*If the device still exhibits an issue, try turning your device off and then on again while connected to power.\n  \n*If the issue persists, please contact Apple Support.\n  \n\n\nA: I have found from personal experience (not only my cell-phone) that debris are very often the root cause of the \"not supported cable\" alert.\nCleaning the female connector (on the device) always fixed the problem in these cases.\n", "Q: Remove battle.net setup from Spotlight I installed battle.net a long time ago.\nEvery now and then I use spotlight to invoke it by pressing ⌘ + space and I start typing \"battle\" every time, the top hit is \"Battle.net Beta Setup\". I do not want to invoke the beta setup, in fact, I am not aware of the existence of these files on my computer, not sure how to search for them except by using spotlight, but there doesn't seem to be a way to find out where they are, and I am reluctant to click on them in case it starts up a setup program and interferes with my existing installations.\n\nA: You can find the location of a Spotlight result by highlighting the result and pressing ⌘+Return. This will reveal the location in Finder.\nAs it's the setup app, it's probably safe to delete, but you can also move it to a location that Spotlight won't search to remove it from the search results but keep the data.\n\nA: George Garside's answer is probably the best, as this sounds like an application you'd want to delete, and not simply 'remove from spotlight' (as in hiding it).\nI've seen instances where a file is stuck in the spotlight search even though it's completely removed from the system.  Sometimes this has to do with permissions of a certain folder and how spotlight indexing works.\nIf this is the case, and the file has already been deleted, it might require a re-indexing of the drive the file is stored on.\nTaken from Apple.com:\n\nFrom the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences. Click Spotlight.\n  Click the Privacy tab. Drag a folder or an entire volume (your hard\n  drive) to the list. If prompted for confirmation, click OK. Remove the\n  item or volume you just added to the list by clicking it and then\n  clicking the minus (\"-\") button. Close Spotlight preferences.\nSpotlight will re-index the contents of the folder or volume.\n\nHowever, since the index most likely screwed up due to a permissions error in the first place, it's a good idea to do more than simply re-index, and instead use one of the many good maintenance applications that exist to repair permissions / clean up misc files / and re-index spotlight all in one sweep.\nPersonally, I use an excellent app called \"Maintenance\" (also referred to as Mac Maintenance, though I've found another application with that as it's name, that didn't work as well in my experiences).\nHere is a link to download if you want to try it.\nhttp://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/16790/maintenance\nAnd Finally (though as I mentioned earlier I don't believe this is your intention) you can actually 'hide' files and certain extensions from the spotlight results on a folder-by-folder level (This feature is often used to keep adult files away from the eyes of children, etc)\nFrom apple.com:\n\nchoose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Spotlight. Click\n  Add (+), then locate the folder You can also drag a folder or disk\n  from your desktop or the Finder into the list.

The user doesn't have Open Firmware Password Protection installed -- what other reasons could there be for cmd+S not working? \n\nA: Core Storage\nIf FileVault 2 is enabled for the OS X startup volume, then EfiLoginUI will present a graphic login dialogue before the start of OS X – seconds after the startup chime. \nIf the startup key combination is timely, then startup should proceed to single user mode after a user's passphrase has been entered. \nFirmware\nWhilst I don't know the model of your Mac, I can draw attention to a 2011 topic that was resolved in MacRumors forums: \n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Mini won't recognize Apple Aluminum Keyboard startup keystrokes\nWireless keyboards\nApple Wireless Keyboards: Using startup keys\nIf I recall correctly, one type of Apple wireless keyboard is (or was) known to be problematic … at the moment I can't find a reference – sorry. \n", "Q: XAMPP on Mavericks install APC and Memcached What I already did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download latest stable release from pecl.php.net with wget- \n\n*Unpack archive\n\n*Run phpize, ./configure, make, make install, etc..\n\n\nThat stuff went well, now I have:\n/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/apc.so\n/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/memcached.so\n\nIn my php.ini (Loaded Configuration File from phpinfo) I added:\nextension_dir=\"/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/\"\nextension=memcached.so\nextension=apc.so\n\nBut the problem is, the libraries are not beeing loaded, the correspondent sections in phpinfo() are missing.\nI have tried to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart apache\n\n*Comment out \"extension_dir\"\n\n*Use \"zend_extension\" instead of \"extension\"\n\n*Specify the full path to the .so files\n\n\nRestart of XAMPP happens without problems, no error log is generated.\nAnyone of you have an idea what could be wrong here?\n\nA: If you've installed XAMPP then you'll have two versions of PHP on your system. I think the problem is that you are using the XAMPP version of PHP, but the extensions have been compiled against the OS bundled version.\nIf you are using XAMPP then you'll need to use the toolchain that comes with XAMPP.\nFor example, try sudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/pecl install memcached, this seems to download, build and install memcached correctly for me so that XAMPP can use it.\nAfter that I just needed to add the extension=memcached.so line to php.ini and now memcached is appearing in phpinfo().\n", "Q: Having trouble connecting via 3G network using my iPhone 4 I'm having trouble using the 3g network I do believe it was a day or so after apple software update 7.1.2 IOS. I can use wifi but not 3G network for some reason.  So I did all of the stuff people were saying reset the  phone. So did and then I even did the airplane mode on and off, then shut off the phone. Nothing seems to work. When I'm at work I have no Wifi and resetting the phone over and over has me extremely frustrated.\nI have searched for a solution and everything I have been finding about this problem was last year in 2013. Are there different troubleshooting steps or ideas to solve this problem?\n\nA: Check to see if your network carrier data options are enabled (probably through your account with the carrier).\nIf so check to see if you have your data turned on Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data switch is to green.\nReset network settings Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings\nIf none of the above work you can always take your backplate off and ensure that your antenna is still connected to your logic board (plenty of tutorials online)\n", "Q: How do I create a scheduled task that deletes files of a certain name everyday? Our voicemail system sends our messages to us via email as mp3 files. When I download the file, it comes down as \"message.mp3\", but of course OSX will rename them \"Message (x).mp3\" when you have more than 1. What I want to do is create a script/task that will automatically delete them everyday (or whatever I choose) as long as they're more than a couple days old.\nI don't know how to a cron task, and one solution I came across was to create an AppleScript (which I also don't know well) and then use iCal to schedule an event everyday that runs the script. But it doesn't work.\nHere's the AppleScript:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    try\n        delete (every file of folder \"Macintosh HD:Users:username:Downloads\" whose name starts with \"message\" and modification date is less than (get current date) - 2 * days)\n    end try\nend tell\n\nAnd in iCal I created a repeating event, with the script attached.\nDoes anyone know how to do this (perhaps a better way?)\n\nA: Add the following to your crontab (run env EDITOR=nano crontab -e to edit your crontab):\n@daily /usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to delete (every file of folder \"Macintosh HD:Users:username:Downloads\" whose name starts with \"message\" and modification date is less than (get current date) - 2 * days)'\n\nUntested as I have no such files on my system.

Safari has suddenly stopped to load Flash videos. \nOn YouTube, for instance : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJENlHEZi18 \nOn another site too. \nIn place of the video, I just have a black rectangle. \nIn Activity Monitor, I do not see any Flash plug-in process. \nSo I guess the bug is in Safari. \nAnyway, I did clear the Flash data in the System Prefs. To no avail.\nIt was working yesterday. Now it is broken. I did not change the prefs. I did not quit Safari.\nThis random bug is really annoying. I have reported it to Apple.\nIn the meantime, how can I have Safari load Flash videos again ?\nThank you.\nI have Safari 5.1.10 on Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: One solution :\nKill the process Safari Web Content. Warning : In all pages, you will lose all the data you may have entered.\nExplanation :\nThe process Safari Web Content has just been killed without human intervention. And Safari reloads all the pages. This is a bug in Safari. It happens from time to time, when many pages are loaded, it is a kind of process apoptosis. Now, I have the Flash Player plug-in process running, and Safari loads the Flash videos. :-) \nConfirmation : \nThe bug has occurred again. This time, I have killed the process Safari Web Content myself. This solution works.\n[Edited : Confirmation of the solution]\n", "Q: iPhone 5s email deleted from Inbox not synchronizing correctly to Exchange server/Outlook inbox I have an iPhone that is configured for Activesync and has been working fine. Over the weekend I was completely offline and while my iPhone was not connected to the internet I deleted around 450 email messages from the iPhone inbox. Around 18 hours later I was back in cell phone range, the iPhone synchronized my new email messages, all looked good.\nThen a few hours later I launched Outlook and found all the messages I had deleted on the iPhone were still present in Outlook. I logged into OWA and confirmed the messages were still showing there too so the Exchange server has not been updated with the changes I made on the phone.\nNow my iPhone is happily receiving new messages and if I delete these from the iPhone they are deleted in Outlook as expected. However, my Outlook Inbox is still showing the 450ish messages I deleted. These messages have not synchronized back to the iPhone.\nI want my Inbox as it currently appears on the phone, not as it currently appears in Outlook. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I resolve this apparent sync conflict and just make my iphone 'win' so that it updates the Exchange server?\n\n*Why did being offline for around 18 hours while deleting messages on the iphone cause this to happen?\nThanks in advance for any assistance.\n\nA: Well I ended up solving this problem with a slightly lateral solution. Despite the fact that the iPhone was not updating the changes I made while I was offline, it was synchronizing all new changes just fine. Given I wanted to maintain the inbox on the iphone, I just created a sub-folder under the inbox and moved all my messages there (on the phone), that change was successfully sync'd to Outlook and then I just deleted all the messages from the inbox on Outlook (Inbox represented the 450 messages I had deleted on the iphone while offline) and then moved the messages from the temporary sub-folder back into the inbox. Everything continues to sync correctly.\nObviously this is not a technical solution as I had only 75 messages on the iphone inbox that I wanted to maintain it was an easy fix. If anyone knows how you might better deal with this scenario when there are thousands of messages in play I'd be curious to know!\n\nA: I know it was a couple of months ago but this may help in the future.\nFrom Outlook at the bottom left are a set of icons. (Mail, Calendar, Contacts...)\nOne of the icons is Folders.  Click it and now in the list of subfolders above on the left there will be one called \"Sync Issues\" expand it.  There maybe a hint to what happened. \n", "Q: How do I get QuickTime to store temporary recordings on another drive? When you do a movie recording or screen recording, QuickTime stores the in-progress recordings in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Library/Autosave Information.\nOn my machine, I have a fast SSD mounted on /Volumes/SSD but a slow platter drive on /. I'd like to send the autosave files to the SSD. With professional programs like Premiere, you can just set the scratch location, but with QuickTime it seems impossible. However, I really like QuickTime's screen recording feature and would like to use it with my fast SSD.\nI tried to ln -s the Autosave directory to point at my SSD, but QuickTime errors out with an \"unknown\" error after that.\n\nA: A much more robust way to do this is to store your entire user folder on the external drive. This avoids needing terminal and also avoids confusion with symbolic links and them breaking when software doesn't expect to see a link or a system upgrade script touches the Library folder contents.\nYou could make a second \"recording\" user to log out of the normal user and have all that user's files on the external drive.\nTo make a new user on an external drive named \"Retina\" and to name the user \"external\", follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Users & Groups\n\n*Unlock the pane if needed\n\n*Click the + icon (lower left)\n\n*Make the new user (I called mine external)\n\n*Control click on the user name and choose Advanced Options...\n\n*Look closely at the Home Directory field - you will make a new folder on the external drive named the same \"external\" as the short name for your chosen user name\n\n*Click Choose...\n\n*Navigate to the external drive (Command-Shift-C shows the computer). I use the Command-Shift-N shortcut to make a new folder called Users, then make a second new folder inside the /Volumes/Retina/Users folder named external - the same case as the user's short name.\n\n\nThen you can use the Apple menu to log out of your current user (or enable fast user switching) to change between the user that has all temp files and recordings to the external drive by logging on to the \"external\" user account.\n\n\n\n\nA: I know it doesn't answers the question specifically to Quicktime, but the above answers didn't solve the problem for me.\nHowever, using OBS Project (which is free / multi platform) I was able to save/stream it directly to the external hard drive.\nYou just have to configure it under Settings.\n\nAnd then start recording.\n\n\nA: Turns out this is actually possible by employing a double link trick. In the terminal:\n$ cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX\n$ mv Data Data_bak\n$ ln -s /Volumes/SSD/QuicktimeScratch DataSSD\n$ ln -s DataSSD Data\n\nand voila! This sets up Data as a link pointing to the local DataSSD file, which in turn is a link pointing to the actual SSD scratch location.\nQuickTime works fine now, and puts its temp files on my SSD just as I wanted. No more screengrab stutter!\n", "Q: FaceTime/FaceTime Audio calls to ipad and iphone simultaniously from overseas (15 calls) Yesterday I received a call from a strange number: +7 (987) 753-20-26 via FaceTime and FaceTime Audio to my ipad and iphone simultaneously.  I did  not answer because I didn't recognize the number, but each time my face was visible (as though I was on a call).  I had a repairman at the house and as soon as his face was the one that was visible the calls stopped.  There were 15 calls, rapid fire, one after the other often at the same time on each device.  It sort of creeped me out, but then I wondered if our system could have been hacked.  Again, it is an unknown number.\nIs there something I need to do to be sure I wasn't hacked?  Could it be a stalker?  Thank you for any suggestions/comments.\n\nA: \n…to my iPad and iPhone simultaneously […] at the same time on each device\n\nYou will receive simultaneous calls on all devices with the same Apple ID. This is how FaceTime works and is not due to any action on the part of the caller.\n\nbut each time my face was visible\n\nThe background to a FaceTime call that has not been answered will be the camera feed from the front camera on the device. This is not transmitted anywhere as the call has not been answered.

Also Safari now opens some pages much slower then Opera.\n\nA: This is spam, introduced by an extension, through superfish.com. AdBlock is not the cause! AdBlock blocks the injected ad, so the extension inserts the text equivalent.\nDisabling AdBlock will remove the text, because it allows the original injection to take place, and will decrease page load time as the secondary text injection is no longer required.\nEnable AdBlock so that the text is shown, then disable other extensions that you have enabled, until the text is no longer inserted.\nThere is a thread over on adblockplus.org regarding this and including a list of extensions (for Chrome) that caused this for people:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=24143\n\nA: Disabling AdBlock extension in preferences seems to help with both the text and speed.  \nBut I still don't understand what was the problem, AdBlock worked for me normally for months.\n\nA: I use Mozilla Firefox on Windows 7.  I removed FastestFox and WindowShopper, and the problem went away.  Do NOT remove AdBlock, as the latter is doing it's job by only allowing the \"App of the Day\" message to show, rather than allowing those two add-ins to work.  This would appear to be new code in those two add-ins, per forum posts on MalwareBytes website.\n\nA: Removed FastestFox.

You can read in more detail about this file here.\nAlbumData2.xml\nThis file is only created by iPhoto 8. It is a smaller version of the\n  AlbumData.xml file that only contains information for the library's\n  albums and events, and none of the actual photos. This file is faster\n  to read for programs that only need to get the list of albums and\n  events in the library.\nAttachments\nThis folder is used by iPhoto 9 as a temporary holding place for\n  photos that are being sent using iPhoto's built-in email features.\nAuto Import\nThis folder is created by iPhoto 7 and later. There does not seem to\n  be any mention of this folder in iPhoto's documentation, but if you\n  put some photos into it, then quit and reopen iPhoto, it will\n  automatically import those photos into the iPhoto library and then\n  delete them from the Auto Import folder. There is also an \"auto\n  import\" Applescript command which does not appear to do anything when\n  called. It's not clear if this was a planned feature for iPhoto 7 that\n  ended up getting pulled out (but not completely, apparently), and it\n  doesn't seem to be very useful for anything, especially since that\n  folder is buried inside a package now, but that's what it does if\n  anyone is curious.\nBackup\nIf a library has been upgraded from an earlier version of iPhoto to\n  iPhoto 9, a copy of the original database files from the library are\n  stored in this folder before performing the upgrade.\nCaches\nOnly present in iPhoto 8 or later, this folder contains additional\n  data for the iPhoto library. Unlike some other Caches folders that can\n  be safe to delete, this one is not, so don't go deleting it in an\n  attempt to clear up disk space.\ncom.apple.iPhoto.plist\nThis file is actually not written out by iPhoto itself, but rather by\n  iPhoto Library Manager. It is a copy of the preferences file that is\n  associated with this library. When you switch between different iPhoto\n  libraries, iPhoto Library Manager will swap out this preference file\n  for the existing preferences before opening the library up.\nContents/PkgInfo\nThis is part of the new package structure in iPhoto 7 that gives the\n  package a type and creator code so that the Finder knows what\n  application the package belongs to.\nface.db, face_blob.db\nContains the data for faces identified by the face recognition feature\n  added in iPhoto 8.\niLifeShared\nStarting in iPhoto 9, the AlbumData2.xml file is now stored within\n  this folder rather than at the root level of the library package.\nInfo.plist\niPhoto 9 added this file, containing basic version information about\n  the library\niPhoto.ipspot\nThis file is written out by iPhoto and read in by Spotlight in order\n  to index the information about the photos in your photo library. You\n  must have iPhoto 5.0.2 or later for this file to be present.\niPhotoLock.data\nThis file is used by iPhoto to help prevent more than one copy of\n  iPhoto from accessing the library at one time.\niPod Photo Cache\nThis folder is created by iTunes if you choose to sync your iPhoto\n  library with a photo capable iPod. It contains cached information\n  about the last time the photos were synced and help speed up the\n  syncing process, allowing iTunes to tell which photos have changed\n  since the last sync and only update those ones. You can delete it if\n  you want to clear up space, but iTunes will have to create it all over\n  again the next time you sync your iPod's photos.\nLibrary.data, Dir.data (iPhoto 2), Library.iPhoto, iPhoto.db (iPhoto 4, & 5), Library.iPhoto6 (iPhoto 6 & 7), iPhotoMain.db, iPhotoAux.db\n  (iPhoto 8), Database (iPhoto 9)\nThese files/folders serve as the central database where iPhoto stores\n  your library information. All your event, album, and photo metadata is\n  stored in these files.\nData, Originals, and Modified\niPhoto 6 organizes its photos fairly differently that previous\n  versions. Imported photos will initially be stored inside the\n  \"Originals\" folder. Within that folder, photos are organized into\n  subfolders based on the roll that they are in, so each roll gets its\n  own folder. Those rolls are then sorted by date (2006, 2005, etc.) and\n  put into dated folders accordingly. So, if you had a photo in a roll\n  named \"Vacation\" and dated February 24, 2004, to find that photo, go\n  into the \"Originals\" folder, then into \"2004\", then into the folder\n  named \"Vacation\". When you edit a photo in iPhoto, the original stays\n  where it is, and the edited photo is placed in the \"Modified\" folder,\n  which has the same per-roll organization scheme within it as the\n  \"Originals\" folder does. The \"Data\" folder contains all the scaled\n  down thumbnail version of photos in your library. If you upgrade to\n  iPhoto 6 from a previous version, iPhoto will rearrange all your\n  photos from the old scheme into the new scheme. After upgrading, you\n  may still see one or more leftover folders named \"2004\" and such.\n  These folders should no longer contain any files being used by iPhoto\n  6, and can be disposed of safely.\nThumbnails, Masters, and Previews\niPhoto 9 organizes photos in much the same way as iPhoto 6-8, but uses\n  the folder names Thumbnails, Masters, and Previews instead of Data,\n  Originals, and Modified\nMetadata Backup\nCreated by iPhoto 8, containing backup copies of the metadata for your\n  photos, events, albums, and other library content. This information\n  can be used by iPhoto to recover a library whose main database has\n  been corrupted.\nProjectDBVersion.plist, Projects.db, Projects.db-journal, SharingActivity.db\nThese additional data files exist only in iPhoto 9 and contain\n  information relating to \"keepsake\" items such as books and slideshows,\n  and information for albums published on MobileMe, Flickr, or Facebook.\nThemeCache\nA cache file used by iPhoto to store theme data used to make books,\n  calendars, and cards\nThumb32Segment.data, Thumb64Segment.data, ThumbJPGSegment.data\nIn order to improve performance, when you add photos to your library,\n  iPhoto creates small \"thumbnail\" versions of your photos and caches\n  them in these files. In iPhoto 5 and earlier, these files are instead\n  called Thumb32.data, Thumb64.data, and ThumbJPG.data.\n\nNote that there are some small and some large differences in the folder structure depending on what version of iPhoto you're using.\n", "Q: Xcode word completion shortcut Xcode's code autocompletion is quite good, I am missing one thing though:\nin vim I can press ctrl+n to autocomplete any word, even those in the comment.\nHere is a screenshot from xcode to show what I mean:\n\nI am wondering if there is a keyboard shortcut to achieve I am looking for.\n\nA: Control–Space bar is used to either turn the Auto-Complete ON/OFF.

Initially, I was convinced the hard drive (ssd) was dead. If I booted from a recovery USB, disk utility would not even find the drive. However, for whatever reason and luck, restarting the computer eventually fixed it; the startup disk would be found and the computer would boot up with no problem. I then checked the disk with a few utilities, none of which found any problems. But, if I turned off the computer, again it would most likely not find the startup drive. I would say it finds the startup drive about ten percent of the time. So if the computer restarts, then I might be rebooting it a dozen times before it boots up. Another thing is that if the computer has booted up, if I put it to sleep, it will not wake up; or it tries to but then it freezes. So that necessitates another round of restarts hoping it will boot. So I have backed up the hard drive contents fairly well, and I've since never turned the computer off or let the computer go to sleep unless it freezes. Fortunately, OS X is stable and I have something like 95 day uptime going, however, the computer is essentially a desktop now with no portability. Does anyone know what might be wrong with the computer? I'm pretty sure I've tried resetting the PRAM and SMC, though this was a long time ago... Anyway, does anyone know anything about a problem like this? I am running 10.7.5 on a Mid-2011 Macbook Air 11-inch, 1.6 GHZ i5.\n\nA: Hard disk drive failure\nA few weeks ago I found similar symptoms with a colleague's iMac: \n\n\n*\n\n*sometimes it behaved as if no drive was installed\n\n*sometimes during normal use, the Mac stopped working (not a total freeze; the reported symptoms were as if there was an I/O issue) – this was less likely to occur if the Mac was cool\n\n*in FireWire target disk mode, every time I tried to fully optimise its disk, the Mac behaved as if the drive had disappeared. \n\n\nA replacement hard disk solved the problems for the user. \nTesting your own hard disk drive\nIf you have an external optical drive, you could perform a thorough backup then try the most powerful test of HDAT2. \nCaution\nA routine that is intended to reallocate bad blocks may lead to dataloss. \n\nIn response to commentary\nA clean installation might complete without error – and you might precede that with a single write of zeros throughout a volume – but still (I could/should have mentioned this in my first edition): I'd be wary. \nIf an entire drive has failed to present itself to software, at any time in the past, then to me that sounds a quiet but unforgettable alarm … expect the unexpected, and so on. \nI should either:\na. no longer trust that hardware; or \nb. perform extraordinarily time-consuming stress tests, which might reveal the nature of the failure and/or partially rebuild trust in the hardware. \nIn a geeky way I'm sometimes happy to spend/waste that time, but option (b) is not for everyone. \nRelated, in Ask Different\nFor bad and/or marginal blocks on hard disks, can anything be more effective than a single pass of zeros?\n– all three answers were good. The accepted answer there links to a Tom Nelson article that includes: \n\n\n*\n\n*use of Drive Genius (page 3) – in my experience not extending the scan significantly reduces the likelihood of detection of bad blocks\n\n*a Disk Utility approach to stress testing (page 4) – and for that stress test to be most effective, you should aim to repeatedly write over as much as possible of the disk before your clean installation of the OS. \n(I wonder … can a Disk Utility approach be thorough enough to repeatedly write over the areas of disk that would be used for the GPT, and so on?)\n\nPersonally: if presented with a disk that might benefit from a multi-pass stress test, I would prefer HDAT2 to Disk Utility. Set aside the machine for a few days, allow HDAT2 to write repeatedly to the entire device …\n\nA: I am not sure if I found a real solution or not, but I've got my computer working properly again at least for the last few days. \nI believe the problem is mechanical; the contact between the hard drive and the logic board is not great. I hypothesize that it's something to do with batteries expanding somehwat inside the case, causing problems, but it could be anything. All I did was open up the case after buying the proper screwdrivers and looking at the tutorials for hard drive replacement. After opening it up, I unplugged the hard drive and reattached it. And now it seems to work okay. But it's only been a few days.\n", "Q: Iphone 4 works with radio, I phone 5 doesnt I have a Pioneer T1809 car stereo with aux adapter for Ipod/phone. It will work with my friends Iphone 4 but will only charge my Iphone 5.. No music.. It doesnt recognize it as being hooked up. Will I need to get a new cable or a new adapter for the existing cable. I had to use an adapter to hook it up to the 5 obviously, do I have the wrong one or do I need an entirely new cable. \n\nA: I have read that most adapters will charge the 5 but not play music unless it has the 3.5mm plug.  People then complain that doesn't work well unless you take the case off.  Read the reviews of these adapters.  It looks like you and I may have to get a bluetooth adapter for our t1809s.  Look up Coolstream Duo or go here.  We will have an opportunity to hide the bluetooth behind the console using this.\n", "Q: Image on external monitor is off-center I have a 13\" retina MacBook Pro and an Acer X223W external display, connected via an official Apple Mini DisplayPort > VGA adapter. The Acer is set to 1680x1050 (its default resolution).\nI wanted to adjust the colors on the Acer, so as a start I hit the physical Auto button on the display. As soon as I did this, the image on the display jumped over to the left by about 2\". So the image is now cut off on the left, leaving a big black gap on the right.\nIf I switch the resolution to anything else, e.g. 1440x900, it'll fill the display like normal again. But if I switch it back to 1680x1050, it gets shifted over to the left again.\nI tried adjusting the horizontal position of the image with the display's on-screen controls, but (a) it was already set to 50/100 (which should be the center), and (b) the maximum value of 100 doesn't move the image far enough to the right to eliminate the gap. So that apparently isn't the issue.\nI also tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting/rebooting the laptop\n\n*Turning the external display off and back on\n\n*Unplugging the Mini DisplayPort > VGA adapter and plugging it back in\n\n*Restarting/rebooting with the adapter unplugged, then plugging it back in\n\n*Repairing permissions\n\n*Repairing color profiles\n\n*Using different color profiles (including one downloaded from Acer's website)\n\n*Forcing OS X to detect displays (System Preferences > Displays, hold Option and click the \"Detect Displays\" button)\n\n*Resetting PRAM\n\n*Plugging the adapter into the laptop's other Thunderbolt port\n\n*Switching the arrangement of the displays\n\n*Changing which display is the primary\n\n*Enabling/disabling mirroring\n\n*Resetting the display via the OSD's built-in reset function\n\n*Hitting the Auto button again\n\n\nNone of those steps made any difference.\nThen I tried plugging the adapter into a different MacBook Pro entirely (non-retina 13\"). Amazingly, it does the same thing – the image shifts 2\" over to the left at 1680x1050.\nI'm running OS X Mavericks 10.9.4 on both MacBook Pros if that's of any relevance, but it seems like the issue is with the display itself since everything was perfectly fine until I hit the Auto button.\nFurthermore, if I take a screenshot of the external display, it captures the full image. So that suggests the laptop is outputting the image to the display correctly, but the display itself is showing it off-center.\nI've found other forum threads that suggest using a different adapter (e.g. DVI instead of VGA), but given that I've always used this display at 1680x1050 with the same adapter, I know it works...\nI'm at a loss as to what else I can try to get the image to reposition correctly. Any help appreciated!\n\nA: Solved it! I had to plug the adapter into my non-retina MacBook Pro, then hit the Auto button on the monitor. It readjusted itself and moved the image back to the center of the screen. Now it's plugged back into my retina MacBook Pro and working perfectly.\nSo I guess it's some kind of weird issue between the retina MacBook Pro specifically and the monitor, since the non-retina MacBook Pro is running the same version of OS X (10.9.4).\n\nA: I had the same problem but with an iMac and a second monitor, where the second monitor, on applying a custom resolution, shifted the screen 2 inches right.\nUnplugging the monitor from the back of the iMac, and plugging it back in adjusted the shifted screen back into place.\n\nA: VGA is analogic, so you have to use Auto function of your monitor to calibrate it's correct size/position. You can also set it from the monitor's OSD control.\n\nA: I connected a new Mac-mini to an existing Acer monitor with an HDMI to DVI cable. The picture was about 2” to the right. After reading the above text, I pulled the HDMI plug from the Mac, plugged it back in, and the picture was perfect!\nThanks. \n\nA: Adjust settings on your monitor. There must be horizontal and vertical positioning setting somewhere. This worked for me for my old Samsung monitor.\n", "Q: Changing display resolution on Retina machines while in Command Line Mode I frequently prefer to boot into the command line mode (CMD + S on boot) instead of booting to the normal GUI-imposed version. I do most of my work in the terminal, so it's nice to save some time and bypass all the unnecessary UI.\nHowever, on retina machines, the command line mode displays at a 1:1 ratio (instead of a 2:1), meaning all text is very, very small. I really want to reduce the resolution it displays at by a factor of two. Is this possible, and if so, how?\n\nA: I found this for you\nscrutil\n\nSlightly more advanced due to the nature of the command line, the free utility called screenutil gets the job done immediately with a quick entry into the Terminal.\nLaunch Terminal and drag and drop scrutil into the command line to use it once, but if plan on using it often it’s a good idea to toss scrutil into /usr/local/bin for easy future access. Once installed, changing the retina display to native 2880×1800 with screenutil is achieved with the following command example:\nscrutil s 2880 1800 16\n\nThe command will report back the resolution change, the 16 at the end is color depth so you can set that to something else if you’d like. You can set it back to the default resolution either through System Preferences or with scrutil s 1440 900.\n\nThere is also this: \nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090413120929454\n/*\n * COMPILE:\n *    c++ setgetscreenres.m -framework ApplicationServices -o setgetscreenres\n * USE:\n *    setgetscreenres 1440 900\n */\n\n#include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>\n\nbool MyDisplaySwitchToMode (CGDirectDisplayID display, CFDictionaryRef mode);\n\nint main (int argc, const char * argv[])\n{\n    int h;                          // horizontal resolution\n    int v;                          // vertical resolution\n    CFDictionaryRef switchMode;     // mode to switch to\n    CGDirectDisplayID mainDisplay;  // ID of main display\n\n    CFDictionaryRef CGDisplayCurrentMode(CGDirectDisplayID display);\n\n    if (argc == 1) {\n        CGRect screenFrame = CGDisplayBounds(kCGDirectMainDisplay);\n        CGSize screenSize  = screenFrame.size;\n        printf(\"%d %d\\n\", screenSize.width, screenSize.height);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    if (argc != 3 || !(h = atoi(argv[1])) || !(v = atoi(argv[2])) ) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"ERROR: Use %s horres vertres\\n\", argv[0]);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    mainDisplay = CGMainDisplayID();\n\n    switchMode = CGDisplayBestModeForParameters(mainDisplay, 32, h, v, NULL);\n\n    if (!

It might work for your purposes.\nhttp://www.pyehouse.com/cscreen/\nThe dev updated it for Intel machines a couple of years ago but did not have a retina machine for testing.\nI expect we will all have to deal with this problem eventually.\n\nA: I wrote a command line application that supports multi-display resolutions, rotations, mirroring, and positioning called displayplacer. In addition to GitHub releases, you can also install via Homebrew: brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer\n\nA: To actually answer the original question regarding single-user (text) mode: the resolution of the text console is typically a kernel parameter (e.g. on linux it's the vga= parameter).\nI don't have a pre-Mojave system to test on, but see this description of boot-args, which implies you may be able to get VGA-res with:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"Text Mode\"\n\nor set the resolution explicitly:\nsudo nvram boot-args='\"Graphics Mode\"=\"1024x768x32\"'\n\nYou'll need to run nvram with system integrity protection disabled (reboot into recovery mode with ⌘-R and run csrutil disable first).\nNote that these days (Mojave) ⌘-S on boot does not leave you in a text mode - you will end up with a WindowServer and can use CoreGraphics-based utilities like scrutil and displayplacer to change the resolution, even though the text mode displays temporarily during boot.  But then since you'd be using Terminal.app anyway, you can just change the font size ;)\n\nA: Assuming you have a WindowServer (as the scrutil, setgetscreenres and displayplacer answers assume, and true under Mojave even with ⌘-S), you can also try the displaymode command-line utility to change the resolution.  Grab it from:\nhttps://github.com/p00ya/displaymode\nTo change the resolution to 1280x800, run it like:\n./displaymode t 1280 800\n\nThis is a simple replacement for scrutil that doesn't use any deprecated or private Apple APIs, and is built for modern architectures.\n", "Q: How can access to start up menu on Macbook Air 2011? I have a Macbook air 2011 /4g/ 11\" , I format my hdd from disk utility and now I want to access to startup menu to reinstall it, I try that with holding option key and it just show me the internet recovery, my  internet speed is very low, after about 8 hours it's show me the start up menu finally and ask me to reinstall the lion 1.7 so on that time because of some issues I just turn my macbook off because I think everything downloaded,\nNow, again when i turn it on for continue the installing process it's show me again the internet recovery and want to download from internet again\nHow can I access to the downloaded data and continue the installation (command+r and option key again get me directly to Internet Recovery)?\n\nA: You need to start using Internet Recovery, and once it's started (which can take a while) you can then select the menu item to install the OS. See the (rather detailed) description of the Internet Recovery system here.\nPlease note that with a slow internet connection, this is going to be a slow process. This is because after downloading and running the Recovery system, it is then going to go away and download the OS installer - and that is quite large.\nAn alternative might be to go to an Apple Store and borrow their (rather fast!) WiFi connection to do this, if you have one close by.\n\nA: Another option is to use the USB recovery key that comes with the Macbook Air.  If you don't have the one that came with this computer, that's another thing you could ask for at an Apple Store (or from someone else who has an Air).\n", "Q: Applescript Command as Specified User to Delete All Files in a Particular Folder I am looking at using the POSIX path to delete the contents of a particular folder on users computers but it must be performed as a particular user.\nI can deploy the script silently from my side using LanRev (Absolute Manage) so the user won't see the password.\nIn my scenario below, I am trying to execute the script specifying the user as \"secretAdmin\" and the password will be \"secretPass123\".\nThe system would be deleting the contents of the folder ~/Library/Keychains/\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    delete (every item of folder \"$HOME/Library/Keychains\") with user secretAdmin password secretPass123\nend tell\n\nUnfortunately this doesn't work.

I recently had to (hurriedly) back up data on an older Macbook before migrating it to a new one. Since all I had at my disposal was a large FAT32 formatted drive, I used that and a manual copy. I've since used rsync to put it back on a (non-journaled) HFS+ drive (under Ubuntu).\nNow most of the files have a corresponding ._ file alongside them. I understand that this is how OS X stores extended attributes and other information on non-HFS+ filesystems. So my question is: now that I have these files back on a HFS+ filesystem, how can I reconcile the information in the ._ files? That is, since the data in those files can now be stored in the HFS+ metadata for each file, how do I put it back?\n\nA: dot_clean\ndot_clean(1) Mac OS X Manual Page\nApple's description: \n\nFor each dir, dot_clean recursively merges all ._* files with their\n  corresponding native files according to the rules specified with the\n  given arguments.  By default, if there is an attribute on the native\n  file that is also present in the ._ file, the most recent attribute\n  will be used.\nIf no operands are given, a usage message is output.  If more than one\n  directory is given, directories are merged in the order in which they\n  are specified.\n\nProceed with caution. Whilst the man page lists no known bugs, it is possible to lose data through careless use of the command.  \n\nA: You can copy the files using Finder. It seems Finder can reconcile these when copying from a partition type that doesn't support extended metadata to a partition type that does, reversing it's procedure for doing the reverse and creating the dotfiles.\n", "Q: How does Sublime open file with cmd+click on its path in Terminal? \n*\n\n*For example:\n$ ls -lsa\n4 -rw-r--r--    1 denis     404 Jul 16 18:36 pgadmin.log\n\n\n*cmd+click on pgadmin.log\n\n*Sublime opens pgadmin.log (if path is 'pgadmin.log:12', it opens it and sets cursor to 12th line).\nHow to change the App, which opens the file?\n\nA: I've checked my suggestion and it worked: if you try to open a file in Finder, this file will be opened with default Application, assigned to its extension. So, if you change default App for this file, you'll get it while opening file from Terminal by click. \n", "Q: Facebook not showing map for places anymore on iPad Under places in the Facebook app for iPad, I no longer get a mapview as it should be, but rather a listview of the places I have visited. Any tips?\n\n\nA: I am not really sure if this is the case but sometimes Facebook tests new features and GUI with some users, often without notification. I haven't heard of that being done with places, but it is the only thing I can think of.\n", "Q: Edit Content of IPSW file to install older baseband firmware I just got this old iphone4 from my aunt a few days ago and it is locked to AT&T... it has already been updated to the latest version 7.1.2 and has never been jailbroken. I have read that the only baseband that can be software unlocked is the 1.59 baseband... What i would like to ask is if it's possible to edit the iOS7.1.2 IPSW file and make it install the 1.59 baseband instead of the current 4.12.09. I was thinking of something like copying some file from the iOS4.0 IPSW file and replacing a coresponding file on the newer IPSW. I have absolutely no idea behind the engineering of these things, so I apologize if I come off as a noob.\n\nA: Downgrading the baseband hasn't been possible to do on the iPhone 4 since iOS 4.0.x. Even if you had been preserving the baseband, the tool to do this with (sn0wbreeze) hasn't been updated since iOS 6, so you wouldn't be able to do it anyways. And to answer your question directly, no, it's not possible to downgrade it by injecting the older firmware into the IPSW. It kind-of used to work that way, but things have changed drastically since iOS 4 (and you needed a bootrom exploit to do it anyways on iOS 4).\n", "Q: Bulk downloading PDF files in iPad I'd like to know whether there is an app or a service which allows bulk downloading of PDF files from a site page. More generally, is there an app that allows bulk downloading to iPad given a string pattern, like the file name or the file extension?\n\nA: curl\nYou can use a curl client for iPhone/iPad to do this (e.g. iCurl or iCurlHTTP). Than you can use this client to download multiple files like this:\ncurl -L -O http://www.example.com/file[1-5].pdf\n\n", "Q: Is there a significant reduction in cooling fan noise level in recent MacBooks? The MacBook Air 11'' (Mid 2012) I am currently using has a fairly loud cooling fan. It doesn't help that it's on most of the time. \nAre the cooling fans in more recent MacBook Airs and Retinas significantly quieter? \nThe question is not about how often they activate, I understand that newer, faster machines are likely to require less cooling. It's all about the cooling fans noise at full speed.\n\nA: The MacBook Pro with Retina Display received an overall update to pretty much most of the internal architecture. According to Apple the fans, vents and many other internal parts underwent redesign and development.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple => High-efficiency fans: Asymmetrically spaced impeller blades and back and side airflow vents work together to move the maximum amount of air while reducing tonal impact.\nPersonally, I have not had any extensive experience with the Retina models, but according to the statement on Apple's website it can be assumed that the noise should be dramatically reduced in comparison to other previous models.\nThe MacBook Air has, to my knowledge, received this update. Even after a quick Google search I could not find any 'fan noise' changing events or developments. However, working occasionally on an Air, I cannot complain about any extensively loud fan noises in comparison to my mid-2012 MacBook Pro (non-Retina). \n\nA: I just got a new retina display 15\" last week . Yes, it does not activate as frequent as the older one. Still when i am doing something performance intensive like Lightroom photo editing or facetime call along with browsing with music playing in the background... The fan gets activated and is loud enough to notice. \n\nA: I hope that this works as an answer to your question. But my Macbook Pro Mid 2010 has stopped making all those horrible noises after over-heating for quite a while now since I discovered there are certain processes calling that issue; i.e. Shockwave Flash Player that's mostly used with Chrome which apparently seems to have the only purpose of draining the battery, overheating the CPU and overusing the fan. Kill that process from Activity Monitor app and that fixes the problem! It's helped me for quite a while now and it's been like a year that I do not get that noise nor the overheating issue anymore.\n", "Q: How to run a script from Alfred or Spotlight or any run dialog?

I want to create a second a partition in my hard disk where one (about 900 GB) is used for Time Machine and another (100 GB) is used to store info like a thumb drive.\nI don't want any existing data to be lost. I know someone who partitioned his hard drive and it is now spoiled and not repairable. I have important info in this hard drive and this is my only one.\nFor your info, I am using a retina MacBook Pro with Mavericks and want to repartition a WD My Passport for Mac hard disk.\n\nA: The reason that everyone always harps on creating a backup before running any kind of partition command is that if something goes wrong, then generally every thing is gone.  I have preformed this kind of operation on PC's many times, generally it has gone well, but the two times over the years the process glitched the partition table was destroyed.  Once I was able to purchase a low level sector recovery tool to get files out that way, the other I had backups and just relied on them.\nIf you don't have any backups, and you preform a partition re-size, and there is a problem, you better hope for either backups, or plan on paying for data recovery.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Yes you can repartition without losing data. Using Disk Utility, perform a repair on your drive to make sure the drive is free of errors (even better, use Diskwarrior if you have a copy). Then unmount your drive but don't eject it. Select the drive in the left hand pane, then go to the Partition tab. On the Partition Layout section click on the \"+\" to create a new partition. Optionally you can specify the new partition size.

The problem is with my local network over wifi.\nOn my Mac OS X 10.9.4 I try to ping its own address, and I get nothing:\n$ ping6 -n fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c%en0\nPING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c%en0 --> fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c%en0\n^C\n--- fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c%en0 ping6 statistics ---\n5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss\n\nOr this:\n$ ping6 -n -I en0 fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c%en0\nping6: UDP connect: Network is down\n\nOr this:\n$ ping6 -n fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c\nping6: UDP connect: No route to host\n\nHere, en0 is my wifi interface, and fe80::bae8:56ff:fe1b:d57c is the address taken from ifconfig or System Preferences pane.\nSame happens when I try to ping6 router's address.\nSame happens when I use %lo0 instead of %en0.\nCuriously, ipv6 localhost is working fine:\n$ ping6 ::1\nPING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) ::1 --> ::1\n16 bytes from ::1, icmp_seq=0 hlim=64 time=0.185 ms\n^C\n--- ::1 ping6 statistics ---\n1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.185/0.185/0.185/0.000 ms\n\nEven more curiously, it works fine via the ethernet cable: both fe80:: address and router address are reachable with ping6, and internet works over ipv6. But not WiFi.\nFirewall is disabled. All settings are default, which usually means \"automatically\". Setting them manually or setting ipv6 address to \"link-local\" changes nothing.\nThe question: what do I do wrong? How to make ipv6 work on my Mac OS X?\nHere is some detailed information below:\n\n$ ifconfig\nlo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384\n    options=3<RXCSUM,TXCSUM>\n    inet6 ::1

I just got a Apple-refurbished mid-2013 13-inch Macbook Air.

I have the same model and the keyboard is also noisy. Although I get it with both typing and just brushing over the keys. I believe this is by design because a lot of people like having that tactile feel of a mechanical keyboard.

(That topic no longer exists, only parts of it were saved locally. I'll append this answer with some of that topic content, slightly adapted.)\nAmongst the other features of HDAT2, there's the ability to destroy data …\nSuggestion\nIn brief: \n\n\n*\n\n*download the UBCD image\n\n*burn the image to CD\n\n*set aside plenty of time for the destruction\n\n*boot the Mac from the CD, this is very quick\n\n*use the keyboard to select and open the Diagnosis submenu\n\n*use the keyboard to select HDAT2\n\n*accept a default\n\n*at the command prompt, type hdat2 then key Enter or Return\n\n*… and from there things should be self-explanatory\n\n\n– just take care to select the correct drive before proceeding with destruction. \n(I'm working from memory, whilst my copy of UBCD is running in my other Mac … the actual routine might differ slightly from what's above but the general idea should be the same.)\nHint: HDAT2 is powerful and versatile, so the documentation may appear daunting, but this should not be an obstacle. If you skip the manual, the on-screen routines are well-designed – alongside technical phrases, in many areas there are plain english hints. \nIn Super User\nHow to erase a hard drive with unwritable sectors?\n– a few good answers, but the accepted answer there involves ddrescue, which is not integral to OS X. \n\nOriginally posted to Apple Support Communities\nIf ever you see the following phrase in red in Disk Utility –\n\n... cksum mismatch ...\n\n– treat it as a red alert that should not be ignored.\nWhilst a subsequent run of Disk Utility may complete without error – whilst the utility may state that a volume appears to be OK – you should not assume that the affected storage is completely OK.\nAim to check all affected devices. So if the checksum mismatch affected a Fusion Drive – or any other application of Core Storage that involves multiple devices – aim to check the whole of each physical device within the affected Core Storage logical volume group (LVG).\nPrecautions\nSome approaches to identification of failing drives (failing e.g. bad blocks) may cause dataloss. So, the usual advice:\n\n\n*\n\n*be thorough with backups.\n\n\nExample\nOn Friday 2014-07-11, whilst running running a released version of OS X on a MacBookPro5,2 with an internal solid state hybrid drive (SSHD), ￼some software behaved in ways that made me suspect a failing disk. \nSaturday morning, from a Disk Utility log:\n2014-07-12 08:01:41 +0100: Checking volume\n2014-07-12 08:01:41 +0100: disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers\n2014-07-12 08:01:41 +0100: disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels\n2014-07-12 08:01:41 +0100: Invalid Disk Label @ 132817997824: cksum mismatch\n\nMinutes later, a subsequent verification completed with no mismatch. Disk Utility described volumes as apparently OK.\nI could have ignored that mismatch as a one-off – maybe something transient. However, the previous day's observations – some of which are confidential (and unrelated to Apple) – made me believe that neither fsck_cs nor fsck_hfs would be capable of revealing the nature of the problem. (It's not clear what approach to scanning is taken when fsck_hfs is used with option -S, and so on.)\nI decided to boot from Ultimate Boot CD 5.3.0 and use the most powerful test in HDAT2.\nDuring use of HDAT2\n\n\nAfter use of HDAT2\nI booted from a different physical disk (external), and refrained from unlocking all Core Storage logical volumes on the affected disk (internal) – whilst I await replacement, I wish to minimise use of the drive.\nBecause Disk Utility can not display S.M.A.R.T. information for disks where Core Storage is used, I ran the nearest available alternative (SMART Utility, on trial) to gain an alternative view of the state of the SSHD. In this case, things seem perfectly clear; the disk is failing:\n\n\n\nReviews with Apple Disk Utility\nSubsequent runs of Disk Utility, e.g. from Recovery OS 10.9.4, continue to describe the affected volumes as apparently OK.\nRelated\nIn a topic in MacRumors Forums: Disk Utility, checksums, fsck_cs cksum mismatches and disk/storage problems. Note:\n\nI should not treat Yosemite as a cause of storage-related problems of\n  this type. …\n\n\nOther parts of that Apple Support Communities topic are lost to me. \nUpdate, 2014-12-12\nStill using the same disk, checksum mismatches have been rare. A summary, maybe not comprehensive: \n2014-07-01 22:18:42 +0100: Invalid Disk Label @ 132809609216: cksum mismatch\n2014-10-02 13:01:37 +0100: Invalid Disk Label @ 133167747072: cksum mismatch\n2014-10-07 09:41:43 +0100: Invalid Disk Label @ 133176135680: cksum mismatch\n2014-11-08 04:13:17 +0000: Invalid Disk Label @ 133163552768: cksum mismatch\n2014-11-13 18:25:07 +0000: Invalid Disk Label @ 133163552768: cksum mismatch\n2014-12-02 09:02:58 +0000: Invalid Disk Label @ 133171941376: cksum mismatch \n\nI no longer plan to replace the drive; I'll get a newer computer. \n", "Q: Mavericks frequently doesn't resolve any hosts after router switch; pings fine After a switch to a new router, I frequently experience that all sites fail to resolve under Mavericks 10.9.4 on MBA mid-2011, both with Safari, Chrome and pinging google.com. It lasts for variable time, from few seconds to several minutes. Same for wifi and Ethernet.\nHowever, during such outages:\n\n\n*\n\n*repeated pings to 8.8.8.8 works fine from OS X Terminal\n\n*sites open fine in Windows under Parallels if network is set as \"Bridged\", doesn't work when network is set to \"Shared\"\n\n*another Mac (MBP 2010) with OS X Mountain Lion resolves and opens sites just without a problem (checked by a script repeatedly pinging google.com) has the same problem as MBA\n\n*iPhone connected to the same wifi resolves and opens sites just fine\n\n\nSwitching back to my original router seems to solve the problem.\nHow to debug and resolve the problem?\n\nA: Turned out the root cause was problematic new router (Sercomm RV6688BCM in my case). After Internet provider replaced it with another instance of the same product, the problem resolved itself.\n", "Q: Enable/Disable Sharing (SSH/File) Based on Network? Is it possible to enable and disable the Sharing features (ssh, file sharing, etc) based on the current network?\nFor example, I want file sharing and SSH to be enabled on my trusted home network.  However, I don't want these enabled when I am connected to untrusted public networks.\nIs it possible to set up this policy?  To differentiate between a home and public network?\nI don't think this occurs by default because I often see shared folders and shared itunes libraries on public networks.  While they are protected by passwords, I would rather be completely sealed up on public networks.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can use ControlPlane for this. It allows you to control your context, like home and other, and set actions for it: when 'enter' home context, enable file sharing, when 'leave' home context, disable file sharing.\n", "Q: Why is everything set to immutable and how do I reverse it? I can't seem to change the permissions (let alone delete) anything in directories like /usr/local (which I should be). My research has indicated that it's due to OSX automatically setting everything to be immutable. I was able to work through my problem by booting into single-user mode and remounting the partition with -uw. From there I was able to use chflags to remove the immutability.\nHowever, I would REALLY love to not have to do this every time. Is there a way I can disable immutability globally across the system? Is there a reason I shouldn't?\n\nA: The root user should always be able to change permissions on the filesystem. I believe things are made immutable by default to help avoid footguns by people who try to copy/paste things from the Internet. Requiring a root password may give people some pause, or at least give them the idea that changing files in /usr/local at random may not be a good idea.\nHomebrew, the Mac package manager, makes /usr/local writable to be able to install packages from the web without needing to use the sudo command every time. It runs the following two commands to achieve that:\nsudo chmod 775 /usr/local\nsudo /usr/bin/chgrp \"admin\" /usr/local/<unwritable directories/files below this>\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to stream audio via AVB between two Macintoshes? I have two Macs that I am trying to stream AVB between. Both machines are running Mavericks and can see other AVB devices and stream with them.

We have tried with an iMac, two Mac Mini, a Mac Book Pro, and a Mac Air.\nIs it possible to stream between two Macs for just audio? Under Audio Midi Setup the network devices is empty.\nThank you.\n\nA: You need an avb switch, like the one from motu or presonus. \n", "Q: Suddenly cannot print over WiFi I have an Epson Stylus NX625 that my family had been using from several Macs and Macbooks until recently.  Now when we attempt to print the Mac reports \"Looking for printer\" for several minutes followed by \"Printer not connected.\"  The printer reports no error (it thinks it is properly connected to WiFi.)\nThis problem started around the time I replaced my old Airport Extreme with a new 6th gen Airport Extreme (the tall one, with 802.11ac).\nMy Macs can still print properly if I connect the printer directly via USB (it is normally configured for wireless printing.)\nI have updated the printer drivers and reset the printing system on each Mac.\nI am stumped.  Any ideas?\n\nA: I had the same issue, had to turn off and on the printer to get it to print every time even if the jobs were only a few minutes apart.   I was not thrilled about changing the 5GHz name as suggested above.\nI resolved my issue by going into the Airport Utility on my iphone, go to Edit->Advanced->Add WPS Printer->With pin   \nNow my Epson Workforce 845 works as it should.  I assume there is something in the router that treats a printer different than a general client and adding it as I did above solves it...at least it did for me.\n\nA: I have dozens of clients using 6th generation Airport Extreme routers. Wifi printers connected to the Extreme (via wifi) sometimes half-drop (i.e., the computers still show connectivity to the printer but nothing prints); this happens to 3 or 4 of my clients about every 6 months. Power cycling their Extremes has been the effective and tolerable workaround for a long time now. \nI think the AE needs power cycling about every 6 months, anyway, to fix other wifi-connection and speed glitches.\nI dealt with Apple engineering on a totally different whacky wifi problem but my client stopped the troubleshooting because he didn't want to pay me for it anymore. That episode showed me, though, that there's definitely some strange wifi problems with the AE, which I still recommend and install more than any other router.\n\nA: I just fixed the same problem. New AE with ac channel. The ac takes over the 5GHz channel and appears to be the problem. Open the Airport Utility, go to the wireless tab and pick Advanced. Check the box to rename the 5GHz and reset the AE. That forces the printer onto the 2.4GHz channel\n\nA: There's a new problem arising with wifi printing in that printers will only connect on the 2.4GHz band.  This band is now congested in many homes in residential areas so the printer may work for a while but then loose connection and not be able to reconnect because there are no available wifi channels.  I hope printer manufactures will quickly get 5GHz support for there printers in the mean time using a Ethernet cable to your router will work as long as your printer supports Ethernet.\n", "Q: Do all editions of OS X use the New Oxford American Dictionary? I know that my US-based MacBook has NOAD as its dictionary reference. Do other parts of the world have the option of other built-in dictionaries? If so, is NOAD still the default?

Does Great Britain have the option of the OED instead of NOAD, for instance?\n\nAll parts of the world have options of other dictionaries. To add (or remove) alternate dictionaries, launch the built-in dictionary application and open the app's preferences. From there you can add or subtract as many dictionaries as you'd like - including the Oxford English Dictionary. \n", "Q: Where can I find this iPad mini wallpaper used in Apple's advert? Can somebody help me find this wallpaper (image taken from http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/). I've looked all over the internet but couldn't find it.\n\n\nA: Apple sourced this image from Robbie George Photography. It's called \"Lake Mattamuskeet\", you'll find it on his page. \n\nA: One way it could be done is to take the image you posted, and using Photoshop or other graphics editing app, magic-wand select the image on the iPad, copy and paste into its own layer, select it again and use the Edit menu >Transform > Skew to square the corners. Then save the now relatively rectangular image as a JPG or whatever and use that as your background pic.\nOR\nGo to Google images and click on the camera icon:\n\nUpload the file, and see what google finds for you.

I've looked for an answer to this but still haven't found one that works.\nI want to use my iPhone as my primary source of internet. I am currently an ATT Uverse DSL customer, but I want to cut the cord and use our current DSL modem/router, the one and only Motorola NVG510 for it's wireless signal only so that my wife and I can airplay from our phones to our Apple TV. \nIs it possible to use our Cell Data to stream a video and then airplay that streaming video to our Apple TV at the same time?\n*Using the iPhone as a hotspot is not an option.\n\nA: See my response to this question on the Apple discussions.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5770041?tstart=0\nBasically, use a static configuration for your WiFi Network, but leave the Router IP address blank.  The LTE icon will be displayed, and the mobile network used for all non-local traffic (ie, Internet) but you will still be connected to the WiFi network can can use all local LAN resources.\nEdit:  I also notice you said use it as your primary Internet connection.  I originally assumed that you meant only for the iPhone.  If so, then my response above should work for you.  If you meant use it as your primary Internet connection for all other devices (laptops, etc) in your home, then of course the only way to do that IS to use your iPhone as a hot spot.  That's kind of the definition of a hotspot.\n\nA: Netflix and YouTube is not possible. I have not found this info anywhere but Apple and/or Netflix apparently do not allow AirPlay without Wifi. Using the latest Apple TV A1469 \"EMC 2633\" you are able to AirPlay without wifi from iOS 7 or later but if you try to \"mirror\" Netflix or YouTube you will receive error messages and the videos will not play. Hulu works\n\nA: It IS possible.  We do it in our camper.  Generic router or access point, connect your phone to the wifi signal (sometimes it takes a while because it says no internet, after a bit it asks you if you want to continue without internet, say yes); connect your apple TV to the same access point. On your PHONE, go into Settings - WiFi, and select the network you are connecting to without internet, then select the little 'i' on the right.  Then select \"Static\". Set IP address to 10.0.1.4 and subnet mask to 255.255.0.0\nLeave all other blank.\nThis will ensure your phone looks to cellular for internet connection, but allows the wifi necessary for AirPlay.  Just make sure you have a fast enough wifi access point/router or you'll have trouble. Also, some apps WANT wifi internet to work right.  But the other poster is correct: Netflix and Youtube (google) bind you with HDMI encruption BULLSH*T.  They are attempting to force you to buy services coming and going.  They don't make it easy!\n\nA: This does work, im assuming the goal is to get rid of buffering from the typical poor wifi you get at hotels and campgrounds. The problem is the wifi connection to the Apple TV suffers too so the resolution goes way down or you still get some buffering. \n", "Q: How to iterate through multiple file extension without caring about case sensitivity?

This is rather strange as I live in Austria and haven't visited these countries since the time I got these devices (>2 years). These calendars are in the section where also birthdays are and can not be edited or deleted. They also don't show up on iCal on the mac. I also checked the timezone on the devices - but this is set to Vienna - Austria.\nSo how would I fix them to Austrian holidays? - or at least delete so I won't be irritated by them.\n\nA: AFAIK, you cannot delete the Holiday Calender on your iOS device. However, you can hide it via Calender app. In the Calendar app, tap Calendars in the bottom center and uncheck the Holiday calendar. And, here's how you can add Austrian holidays to your iPhone and iPad calender:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Now, tap on Add Account\n\n*Scroll down and tap on Other\n\n*Tap on “Add Subscribed Calendar”\n\n*Type in “http://laudatio.com/florian/ical/AustrianHolidays.ics” and press “Next”, and then press “Save”\n\n*Press \"Done\".

In almost any text field or app you are typing text into you can hit F5 or Opt+Esc to bring up the equivalent of the iOS autocomplete list. This is different than the auto spellchecking system built into the Mac.\n\nThis is similar to the answer given by @Greenonline, but works in almost any app that was developed using Apple compliant text fields. Just as an FYI, the Firefox web browser is an example of an app that DOES NOT comply with this, as well as many web-based Javascript text editors that watch for special key inputs (like the ones found on this website).\nIf the auto spellchecking is NOT turned on for your system for some reason you can enable it by going to:  menu > System Preferences > Keyboard > Text  and checking Correct Spelling Automatically to on.\nIf you are looking for an alternative to the built-in functionality, then you could look at BBAutoComplete as an alternative.\nIt was created years ago as a free plugin for BBEdit (no longer needed since version 9 on has autocomplete built-in). But the plugin can be used with any scriptable application including Word and TextWrangler.\nIf you are looking for a writing app specifically then I would look at Scrivener.\nThe cool thing about Scrivener's autocomplete is that it lets you set up a separate autocomplete list for each project. This comes from the fact that it was designed for writers working on projects that might need to have specially created autocompletes for fictional characters or locations that aren't in a standard autocomplete system.\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: I developed an English Input Method for macOS.\n\nDownload the pkg file and install it: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIxckfW\nhttp://blog.csdn.net/lwl_ls/article/details/8564940\n\nplease contact 086 18666291287 or lwl.roger@gmail.com if needed\n\nversion 1.3:\n-input freely in any application of macOS.\n-select automatically completed words by number.\n-select the first suggested word with the Space key.\n-enter the characters you typed with the Enter key.

Deleted .plist files, removed message caches, reset passwords, coordinated sign on/offs between my iPhone and my Macs, reset iPhone and reinstalled Mavericks on my Macbook Air. All pointless exercises. \nI suspect it all started because I jailbroke my iPhone using Pangu. It may or may not have been the culprit, but my problems started a couple of days after I did it. All my phone conversations went green and stopped synchronizing with Messages apps on my Macs. Trying to send a new message from Macs would result in either \"Your message could not be sent\" error with a warning icon next to it, or:\n\nXXX is not registered with iMessage.\n\nSo I restored my iPhone to factory defaults using iTunes. That didn't help immediately, but in a day or two, my conversations with other iPhone users went blue. So I am happy that works.\nSo now I sacrificed my Macbook Air to try and make messages work on it. I reinstalled Mavericks several times, each time trying different approaches: not immediately signing into iCloud, not associating an iCloud profile with login profile, etc. Nothing helps. I launch Messages app, it asks me to sign in (and I do, successfully), and then nothing goes through. \nSending messages to myself also works inconsistently. Yesterday, whatever I sent to myself (using phone number) would appear delivered to the same window, but not on my phone. Today I get \"... not registered with iMessage\" error. \n\nA: I had a similar problem, with the culprit being that iCloud got confused, and continued to send text messages as iMessages, so that my new phone (non-iphone) never got them.\nTurns out, in order to turn off iMessages settings, you must disable iMessage EVERYWHERE. If you turn off iMessages on a phone, and leave it on your iPad, it won't reset (this was my issue).\nSo, I suggest you try this: iDevices (all of them): Settings>Messages. Turn off Messages. (on your iPhone, you can turn on sms message so at least you still get texts).  On Macs, remove any accounts in iMessages by clicking '-' by them in the account preferences. \nMake sure you have de-registered on ALL your devices. Give it an hour or so. Then create accounts on messages on the devices using your Apple ID. See if it works.\nIf this does not work, call AppleCare.  I found that if you go to the AppleCare link in the website, it warns that it will charge you $$ per min for help if you don't have an AppleCare plan. Call the number anyway, agree to whatever. When I called, Apple did not charge me for the iMessages issue, as it is a known issue. (mine was slightly different, I will admit).\n\nA: I have had this happen on one of my Macbook pros. It turned out that the Macbook's serial number had been lost when after a hardware repair had been completed by a third party. \nIf you go to About this Mac and choose More info you should see your serial number, if it is missing that could be the problem.\n\n\nA: I had a different problem with safari freezing when I swiped back a page.\nResetting my PRAM fixed safari and also fixed the problem with Messages.\nShut down your Mac.\nLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. \nTurn on your Mac.\nPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.\nHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time.\nRelease the keys.\nSo give it a try it might work for you too.\n\nA: The Problem was only for sending and receiving msg on my MacBookPro, To fix it I had to go on my iPhone: Setting, Messages, Transfert SMS, and then on my mac a code just appeard, I've enter this code on my iPhone and the problem was resolved :-)\n\nA: I had a similar issue where Messages on my Mac Mini had been sending and receiving texts and then suddenly stopped. \nTurns out I had to go to\nSettings -> Messages -> Send & Receive -> Use Your Apple ID for iMessage\non my iPhone. After verifying my Apple ID password, it worked. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: This might be a far shot but try removing and re-adding your credit card information in your apple ID.\n\nA: I had the same issue, that iMessages didn't show up on my Mac - only on the iDevices.\nThe root cause was however, that iMessage was not active anymore on the iPhone, as pointed out by @chrismukherjee via In Settings > Messages the iMessage setting is turned on.\n\nA: I have found that disabling and enabling FaceTime on both the iDevices and Macs can help solve iMessage problems.\n\nA: I found a solution! Go to Messages > Preferences, select the account in question on the left side column; click the \"Account Information\" tab and tick the \"enable this account\" box opposite of the selected account. All works great now. Hope this helps...\n\nA: Settings -> Messages -> toggle it off, then toggle it back on and tried signing in on my macbook again and it worked\n\nA: On your iPhone, go to Settings > Messages... \nThen turn off, and then on again, the iMessage toggle at top. \nNow try again on your desktop. That worked for me. \n\nA: I had a similar problem. I believe this starts when you connect both you iOS device and your Mac to the same iMessages account. I never bothered to fix it on mine (I just stopped using it on my computer LOL).\nBut I actually think I know what will fix it though. You can make a new Apple ID account for your iCloud and messages (still keep the old one for iTunes and the App Store though).\nWhen you sign in to the new account, any problems that you had with the old one should be gone – I'd expect. But I wouldn't recommend connecting both your computer and your phone until you're sure it works on one of them.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: Is there a way I can obtain Mavericks without having to download? My Wifi connection is not stable enough to be able to download 5.3 Gb. Is it possible to download from a thumb-drive? Does the Apple store sell Mavericks on a thumb-drive?\n\nA: Yes, you can purchase directly from the apple store, If they don't have a physical Device to sell, you can take your device and get it upgraded for free.\n\nA: I would like to suggest that you ask a friend with a fast internet connection to download it.\nAfter the download has finished, just copy the installation file (you can find it in the Application folder) to your USB and then double click it at home.\n", "Q: Mac mail shows thousands of incoming emails in Activity Does anyone know how to bug test Mac Mail? \nEach time I open it, it starts to hog resources and shows thousands and thousands of \"incoming mail messages\".\nI certainly do not have any email arriving... \nI use IMAP accounts mostly with Google accounts and on Mavericks 10.0.3\n\n\nA: If you've just set up Mail, it will attempt to download all the mail that it can find from your mail server. This can't be configured in Mail, only in the mail server/provider's settings.\nFor gmail - set IMAP sync off for just about all your mailboxes to let one sync start.

How to get rid of that or use it well?\nsee screenshot\n\n\nA: Emoji are simply unicode characters that are rendered as such by the operating system. In the following screenshot, you can see that unicode is \"allowed\" in filenames:\n\nIn fact, these are even rendered by Finder:\n\nTo fix this, simply rename the file through Finder or Terminal. \nThis happens because whatever glyph substitution algorithm that they use is picking up the unicode text in the filename and replacing it with Emoji (which is a ttf font on OS X). \n\nA: If you want to see the monochrome Unicode characters instead of the graphic emoji ones, the only way to do it is to manually remove the font called Apple Color Emoji. However, if you do this you'll lose the graphic emojis in Messages, Mail, etc. You should still get the plain monochrome character in those apps.\n", "Q: Can this RAM work with iMac 2010? http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Information-Ddr3-So-dimm-jm1333ksn-2g/dp/B007I5CMGK\nIt said it is a 2gb Ddr3 1333 So-dimm, is iMac support all Ddr3 1333 So-dimm?\n\nA: From iMac (Mid 2010: Memory specifications):\n\nThe iMac (Late 2010) computers have four SDRAM slots in the bottom of\n  the computer and come with at least 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM installed as two\n  2GB DIMMs into two slots. \nThe maximum amount of RAM you can install in your computer is 16 GB (a\n  4 GB SO-DIMM in each slot).\nYou can use any Small-Outline dual inline memory modules (SO-DIMMS)\n  that meet all of these criteria:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*PC3-10600\n  \n*Unbuffered\n  \n*Nonparity\n  \n*204-pin\n  \n*1333 MHz\n  \n*DDR3 SDRAM\n  \n  \n  You can use RAM module sizes of 2 GB or 4 GB in each slot.\n\nAnd from iMac: How to remove or install memory:\n\n", "Q: Automator can't find Symbolic Links?

But I do want some sort of aggressive notification - to the point of texting me on my iPhone if that's what it takes. An alternative to that last one would be an iPhone app.\n\nA: You could create a Yahoo pipe that filters your RSS feeds for those specific keywords. Then create an RSS feed of the pipe's output. Use that to create a Feed Channel trigger in IFTTT that texts you, emails you, notifies your iphone, etc. It’s a multilayered approach, I admit, but I think it could work for you if you don’t mind using those services.\n\nA: Try RSS Bot - News Notifier from the Mac App Store! https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/rss-bot-news-notifier/id605732865?mt=12\n", "Q: How to automatically apply permissions to files added to a shared folder I have a shared folder setup on a Mac Mini Server. It has permissions for our company group to read/write. When a mac user adds a file to the shared folder, it inherits the permissions of the folder and everyone can access it (yay!).\nHowever, when a PC user adds a file to the folder, it insists on applying its own permissions to the file, not allowing the other users in the group to access it. I have to manually go into the server and apply the folder permissions to the new files added.\nHow can I have the files added by the PC users automatically inherit the permissions of the parent share folder?\n\nA: I believe the way to resolve this is to set up ACL inheritance permissions on the parent folder. More about this here.\nFirstly enable ACL permissions for SMB shares with the following command. \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server AclsEnabled -bool YES\n\nThen set up inheritance permissions on the parent holder with the following command. This should recursively go through your share and apply the relevant permissions.\nsudo chmod -R +a \"group:REPLACE_WITH_YOURGROUP_NAME:allow readattr,writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity,list,search,add_file,add_subdirectory,delete_child,file_inherit,directory_inherit\" REPLACE_WITH_PATH_TO_PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER\n\nTo be safe I'd recommend creating a test share to try the chmod command before applying it to your company's share. Then once you are sure you get the right results apply it to the live/production share.\n", "Q: What app can I use to create a PowerPoint on an iPhone? I'm looking for an iphone app that can CREATE powerpoints with normal functionality. There are many apps that can view powerpoints but not many that can create powerpoints. Office Mobile (Microsoft) can view and edit them, but not create powerpoints. Office2 Plus can create powerpoints but you gotta pay them to be able to save powerpoints. WPS office can create powerpoints. The problem is either you can't change the background color or I can't find it. I really thought that a basic feature of powerpoints.

Secondly, CPU usage exceeds 100% while running my simulations.\n\n\n\nA: Seeing your CPU load graph (@200%) it appears your machine can handle 4 threads. Each thread can handle 100% of CPU load. 4 (virtual) cores can handle 4 threads, and 4 threads can handle a total of 400% CPU load. So 200% just means 2 cores are working at 100%.\nWhy they are stuck at 100% I can not tell. It might be something in your code. It might be something in the MATLAB's code. Is there some kind of debugging tool within MATLAB? You might try the MATLAB forums as well.\nIf your code is behaving differently on the same hardware using the same version of MATLAB tell us, then we can try to fix it from there.\n", "Q: Creating a script that will execute a program and if it exits without crashing, will run it again I've already asked this question in the UNIx exchange but I was told to ask here also about AppleScripts if the standard shell does not work.\nI require a script that will open an application. Wait for it to exit, if the application exited gracefully (I.E: did not crash) relaunch it. Otherwise, keep the crash report open and exit the script. I'd like this script to run until I quit it manually.\nSo far the following has been suggested:\nwhile open -W /path/to/application.app\ndo\n    :\ndone\n\nBut this opens the application and then either on crash or exit will automatically run it again. I assume this is because open regardless of waiting or not will terminate with a normal 0 exit code. Unless of course open crashes but in this case it will not.\nAny assistance with this is appreciated.\nThanks.\n\nA: To keep restarting the job on succesful exit You can use launchd on OSX. For this You have to prepare *.plist file in order to \"tell\" launchd how to behave.\nTo restart application on succesfull exit please look at KeepAlive -> SuccessfulExit key (more info: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/launchd.plist.5.html).\nTo start your job, You'll need to start it via launchctl command, for example:\nlaunchctl load path/to/file.plist\n\nTo stop it:\nlaunchctl unload path/to/file.plist\n\nMore informations about launchctl/launchd programming here:\nhttp://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/launchd-examples-launchd-plist-file-examples-mac\nhttp://launchd.info\n", "Q: iTunes freezes when syncing with iPhone I have a problem with iTunes (latest version) freezing when connected to my iPhone 5 (iOs 7.1.2) via USB. It connects with my elder MacBookPro, with that iTunes, but not on my iMac. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the cable since it connects very well with iPhoto so I guess something has been messed up in iTunes itself. What can I do to fix this, reinstall ITunes or is there any more easier fixes? I have reset the SyncServices but that didn't help and I have tried different cables too but the beach ball keeps coming back after each tryout (and freezes, not continues to work).\n\nA: I would suggest you download and install a fresh copy of iTunes and report back. \nBefore doing that, though, I suggest you create new user account on the iMac and see if iTunes hangs up when you plug in the phone. If there is no problem, then perhaps something is wrong with the iTunes preference files for your account.\nLastly, you might want to sign out of the iTunes Store (if you are currently logged in) and sign in again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to interrupt installation procedure at power on My friend is bringing back a new Macbook Air from abroad to the UK for me.

As I see we need take a part in Enterprise Developers Program.  But there is a some points I want to clarify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it right that Enterprise Developers Program allow to distribute the application without the publication of them in App Store ? If it is where the user will get our application ? It will be separate portal ? Or something else ?\n\n*Our customers don't want that our (and their) iOS program will be sensed to Apple.  Is it possible to distribute our application  within our customers without the publication it on App Store and event without the sending it to Apple ? How will be working program distribution and the update process in this case ?\n\nA: An app is just a file. You can distribute them through a sophisticated framework such as a custom App store hosted on your own servers or just place them on a web server. In fact, you could also just email the app or push them through iTunes or other file sharing technology.\nWhen you sign up as any iOS developer - you can install apps on your devices without ever submitting them to Apple. In the case of an enterprise account, you are allowed to install them for production use as well as development use.\nThe mechanism you choose for Mobile Device Management will affect your costs and benefits for the various distribution methods, but your general question is answered - Yes, as an enterprise developer no Apple involvement is needed or possible if you don't want your apps ever on the App Store in general or getting reviewed by Apple in specific.\n\nA: There seems to be some misunderstanding here. If you have an enterprise license, you can distribute any number of apps within your enterprise. If you are a developer, not part of that enterprise, you don’t need an enterprise license - it is actually no good to you. Assuming that neither you nor the enterprise want to go through the App Store, you can deliver the IPA files, or you could take your Mac with your finished product and create a build on behalf of the enterprise. \n", "Q: Closing other tabs in terminal on Mac? I am using iTerm2, but I wouldn't mind switching back to the original terminal for just this feature. \nI open hundreds of SSH tabs every day and often end up working after a while only working on 1 terminal and other SSH tabs don't really matter anymore. In the browser at least you have \"closer other tabs\", \"close left tabs\", \"close right tabs\".\nIs there any way to have a \"close other tabs\" in a Mac OS X terminal?\n\nA: As a work around, you can drag the tab you want to keep to a different window, then close the first window with the extraneous tabs and they are all gone with one click.\n\nA: As is mentioned in the question comments, this is not possible in iTerm 2. It is possible in the built-in Terminal.app, but that was not the question.\nWhile this isn't an optimal solution, a script has been written to implement this in iTerm. I did not write the script nor have I tested it, so I cannot verify the effectiveness of this solution.

I need to check the path to a program -- I want to point to the binary, not to the \".app\" which is a directory. How do I do this?\n\nA: Navigate to your Applications folder, right click on any app, choose Show Package Contents and navigate to Contents/MacOS/. Most of the times, the binary is named after the app so, if using the path on a script, you'll be mostly safe by using /Applications/(appname).app/Contents/MacOS/(appname), where (appname) is, well, the name of the app. If the app name has a whitespace in it, eg. Sublime Text, don't forget to put the path between double quotes (or escape it), in your script.\n\nA: As @megadroid posted, Applications have executable in Contents/MacOS directory. However executable name not necessarily is the same as app name. To get exact executable name, You can read it from Info.plist file (under CFBundleExecutable key) or do it from Terminal.app with for example:\nAPP_PATH=\"/Applications/Mail.app\"\necho \"$APP_PATH\"/Contents/MacOS/$(defaults read \"$APP_PATH/Contents/Info.plist\" CFBundleExecutable)\n\nJust change APP_PATH variable.

(I didn't do it and I don't suspect a virus to change translations)\n\n\nI'm running Safari 7.0.5 on OS X 10.9.4\n\nA: The way to determine what changed is to diff the current folder against a backup copy from when the code sign was valid.\nWhy could be as simple and harmless as bit rot or a filesystem error and it could be that some other tool injected code.\nUnless you routinely list and checksum each file in /Applications/Safari.app and compare those results, your best bet might be to re-install the latest combo updater from http://apple.com/downloads and re-check that the binary is properly signed. If not, you might need to back up that machine and start with a clean erase and reinstall and watch to see what / when Safari gets modified going forward.\n", "Q: How to have a custom (or no) sort order in Finder windows Similar to this question, that has been answered, I have an end user that wants to sort folders in a particular order that doesn't really match any of the basic sorting methods.  She doesn't like the list view, instead preferring the column view, so that answer wouldn't really work for her.\nShe would like to sort folders that are named after months in the order they would appear on a calendar.  Basically like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Work January\n\n*Work February\n\n*Work March\n\n*Work April\n\n*.....\n\n\nNormally I'd say there's no way to do this, at least without using tricks similar to the answer of the question I linked to above, which are in my opinion outside the scope for most basic users.  However, at one point she had a folder set up similar to this.  It could have very well been a bug or anomaly but I'm trying to exhaust all options before ruling it as such.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: If you simply put numbers (for the months) in front of the folders names they will be sorted.\nIf you prefer then use the Folder Action and Automator to do that automatically, for the folder containing the sub folders with the months names (numbers).\n", "Q: Upgraded RAM, Bootcamp doesn't recognize I have a Macbook 13' i5 early 2011, with Windows 8 64 bits and recently I bought new RAM kit from Crucial (8gb). After I installed the hardware, the windows OS doesn't recognize all 8GB, like the printscreen attached shows. Does anybody knows why?\n\nA: Can you boot into Mac O/S? If so open up System Profiler, click on the memory option and see what the Mac is seeing. If it sees all 8GB then the issue is with windows and you might want to ask your question on superuser or another Windows forum.\nIf the mac side only sees the same 4GB then you may have an issue with the DIMM. It could be not seated properly, contacts could be dirty (clean the contacts with a pencil eraser and then rubbing alcohol) or the DIMM could be defective.\nAnother quick (and sometimes overused) trick would be to zap the PRAM:\nReboot and hold down COMMAND - OPTION - P - R (that's four keys) and let it bong a couple of times before releasing the keys and booting into Windows.\n", "Q: I get errors when trying to install GTK+3 on my Mac OSX 10.9 system I'm trying to install GTK+3 on my Mac OSX 10.9 system to run a pyGObject project I've been developing in Ubuntu.

I authored a 1 page document of about 900 words, and an embedded image (a chart).  Storing/exporting this document from Pages 5.2 causes the file to expand to 1.6 MB in size.  However, opening and saving the same .doc file in MS Word gives me a file (.doc) of only 99 KB. Why is Pages so inefficient (some 16 times larger)?\nIs there a way to force Pages to trim the size?  My best alternative is to open the same 1.6 MB file in MS Word, and then re-save (which gets it back to a sensible size).  But I would like to eliminate MS Word entirely, except for the *.doc, which my clients like.\n\nA: There is a bug in Pages. When you export a file in \".doc\" or \".docx\" format it embeds 489KB PNG files (a single one in a docx file, three in a doc file). These files are intended to be used as the background fill on default shapes, but they are present whether they are used or not.\nI documented the bug here.\nAnd reported it to Apple as rdar://17089255.\nAt the moment the simplest solution is to open and close the file in another application like Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. They both strip out the unused PNG files.\n", "Q: AirPlay on Apple TV works for iOS devices but not for Macs I am trying to use AirPlay mirroring in a conference room-style setup using a 3rd-generation Apple TV. All software is fully-updated (as of 7/24/2014).\nAll devices are connected to a strong network without any password.\nFrom an iPhone 4s, the AirPlay service shows up in control center, and mirroring works fine. From an Early 2014 MacBook Air, AirPlay never becomes available in the menu bar or in Display preferences, OR in regular iTunes.\nWhat should I do to try to troubleshoot this?\nEDIT:\nI had been wondering if there was a subnet issue of some kind, but it appears not. For illustrative purposes, the Apple TV is 10.10.17.217. Two iOS devices can AirPlay to it from .18.8 and .18.196, but the MacBook Air cannot from .20.127. All have the same subnet mask of 255.255.240.0, and are pointed at the same router (.16.1).\nI suppose I still need to try with other AirPlay endpoints and with other MacBooks, but I've really got nothing to go on beyond guess and check.\nAaaand I just checked with an iMac connected to the same network, .17.118. Nothing.\n...\nOKAY HOLD ON A SECOND.\nI did a teeny bit of Googling and found some references to Bluetooth being added as a substitute/supplement for Bonjour discovery of AirPlay in a recent update. On the hunch that iOS devices are a bit more promiscuous with Bluetooth than the Macs would be, I tried testing the iOS devices with Bluetooth turned off. Here's the thing: once you're connected, you can turn off Bluetooth, but if Bluetooth is not turned on, you will not be able to see the AirPlay endpoint.\nI noticed there was a Bluetooth setting in the Apple TV as well, and saw that it was just on and searching. Upon turning it off, the AirPlay option immediately disappeared from the iOS devices. Back on, and the option reappeared. Still nothing from the Macs.\nThe Apple TV is running software version 6.2 (6698.99.50.31).\nWhat the hell is going on here?\n\nA: First thing I'd check is whether the firewall is enabled on your Macbook and blocking incoming packets. If the firewall is on, try turning it off temporarily for a few minutes to see if the AirPlay icon appears in the menubar.\nNext thing to check is whether the devices are on the same subnet. You can find the IP address and subnet mask of your Apple TV in Settings -> General -> Network. And the IP address and subnet mask of your Macbook in System Preferences -> Network -> Wi-Fi -> Advanced... -> TCP/IP. Ideally what you should expect to see is the same subnet mask on both devices (likely something like 255.255.255.0) and IP addresses that are similar except for the number after the last dot (something like 192.168.0.125 and 192.168.0.138).\nThose are the two things I'd check first. Check those and let us know how you get on.\nApple have a guide to trouble-shooting AirPlay problems for Macs. There are a few other things that might help too: About AirPlay Mirroring in OS X\n\nA: What's happening is that since Apple TV OS 6.1 and iOS 7.1, iPhones and iPads have supported Bluetooth discovery of Airplay services for Apple TVs.\nWhat this means is that even without doing any pairing, the Bluetooth does a \"handshake\" between the iPhone/iPad and the Apple TV that exchanges discovery information. This means that even if you're not on the same network, you can \"see\" the Apple TV. Note that the Airplay itself doesn't take place over Bluetooth... that still happens over Wi-Fi/Ethernet. The Bluetooth \"handshake\" just tells the client device the IP address of the Wi-Fi or Ethernet interface of the Apple TV that the client can find the service on.\nThis is immensely useful in enterprise type environments where these things tend to be on different VLANs, because the Bonjour protocol that normally serves this purpose is a broadcast protocol that doesn't cross network boundaries without help from a Bonjour relay service like Avahi.\nUnfortunately, this Bluetooth Discovery feature has not been available for Macs, which is why your iPhone/iPad can see the Apple TV and your Mac cannot. Fortunately, with the latest beta release of Apple's Yosemite OS, this appears to be working now (Hooray!)\nIt also appears that Apple is implementing a peer-to-peer Airplay system in iOS 8 that doesn't rely on corporate networks at all.\nHope this was clear and helpful,\nDrax\n\nA: I had a very similar issue, the subnet masks matched, and both my apple tv (gen 1) and my macbook pro (non-retina) were connected to the same network, same subnet, etc... But, I could not airplay from my mac to my apple tv. I could sync the apple tv, sharing or not sharing photos....\nI reset the network on the apple tv (chose the same network, reentered the password) and then almost immediately, I could airplay from iTunes on my computer to my apple tv. \n\nA: Is air play mirroring enabled in System Preferences? To enable it open System Preferences and click on the displays. Then at the bottom there should be a check next to show mirroring options in the menu bar when available. If not click the box to enable it. \n\nA: I had a similar issue and the reason for not being able was the firewall. \nWhat I found out are the following cases:\n(1) Firewall deactivated -> Airplay should work.\n(2) Firewall activated, Block incoming connections: OFF -> Airplay should work.\n(3) Firewall activated, Block incoming connections: ON -> Airplay does not work.\nIn my case after moving from (3) -> (2) everything was fine again.\n", "Q: Applescript System Events Keystroke broken after 10.9.4 It seems like the recent Mavericks update has broken the keystroke command in applescript -- whenever my script reaches that point, it freezes.

It is only happening in Safari, in Firefox it is working fine.\nWe have allowed traffic to the OCSP and CRL servers specified in our HTTPS server certificate, however, in a packet capture from the Mac, I can see it sending AAAA DNS requests for the OCSP and CRL servers names (which are failing, because IPv6 is not configured/supported on this network), but the machine does not appear to fallback to IPv4 (A) requests.\nOther DNS lookups (safari looking up google.com.au) send simultaneous AAAA and A lookups.\nIs this a known bug? Is there anything on the network side we can do to resolve this issue?\nI am interested to hear if there is a config change on the Mac we can make to fix this, but it is not a solution, as we need to make as minimal a change to the users personal devices as possible.\nThank you.\n\nA: So... There was another thing causing my portal to not load (redirect ACL). The DNS was a red herring, and the only reason we saw AAAA and not A requests was because the machine had already cached the answer for the A record.\nFinding that out was humbling... what a silly mistake!\nAnyway, no issue with the Mac here, but if you see similar behaviour, flush your DNS cache and try again!\n", "Q: Charles not working on iPhone at Starbucks I'm using Charles to sniff out the traffic on my iPhone at Starbucks and for some reason it won't work with at&t wifi. Google Starbucks wifi does, however. I use my iPhone to connect to the same wifi network that my MacBook is connected to. Then, for the proxy settings on my phone, I enter my computer's local IP address and the port that I specified in the proxy settings on Charles. I'm aware that some wifi networks block certain ports, but even when I change the proxy settings on Charles so that it's dynamic and it finds an open port, it still doesn't work. Any ideas?\n\nA: Client isolation. It is your enemy and your friend here. This makes it so not only can you not access your iPhone from your MacBook, but other devices on the network cannot access your MacBook or your iPhone either. There are a number of ways to implement client isolation on an IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) network and even more ways on a IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) network, but they all essentially accomplish the same task - clients are only allowed to communicate with the access point and/or gateway.\n", "Q: Am I being monitored?

My ex has a Mac desktop at his house and at his business. I’m not sure if he’s the one monitoring my computer activities…or malware??.  But in all seriousness, I am very curious to what this means. I’m too old to be monitored….\nThank you.  \n\nA: Install Little Snitch. It's an Outbound Firewall meaning that when apps on your computer try to establish connections to other machines, you'll get a notification and be able to block the connections.\nIf someone is trying to monitor your computer, Little Snitch would inform you of the outgoing network connections and allow you to block them.\n\nA: First, I have the exact same messages in my log files. I also was worried, but parental controls is more of a mechanism to restrict usage of the system. In other words you would use parental controls to make the system less powerful, and as an admin you can easily turn them off.\nYou would go to \nSystem Preferences > Parental Controls\n\nas an admin, and you will be able to assure yourself that it's only Apple.\nIt seems that with 10.9.4 it was activated for the Guest user (Managed Preferences). It's irritating, but bearable. \nThat being said, Remote Management or ARD is the tool one would use in this situation to monitor a user. This requires access to the target computer. Since you've already had your email hacked, perhaps it's time to back up your personal data and take a couple of hours and wipe your system clean. Change passwords, create a new user, use your firewall, and change your iCloud info.\nReasonable precautions actually go far. \nYou'll probably want to start by removing your name from the logfile you posted completely. \nGood luck with everything.\n\nA: So this is super old but just in case someone comes across this. ViewBridge is a way for applications to display UI in separate memory space than the main app. This is how an app can ask for your admin password and will never know the password (Apple creates a separate window on another thread that the app can't access so your password is safe).\nViewBridge is the name of the framework that enables this functionality, and NSRemoteView is a wrapper around the base NSView programmers normally use to display views. NSRemoteView displays a view that isn't from the \"main\" app (again, something like a password prompt). It can't display views from another computer or stream video or anything like that. It's just for displaying system views (like parental controls).\nNothing in these logs indicates remote access to your machine. In fact, it would be probably the stupidest program in the world that would remotely access a machine and then log it publicly.\n", "Q: OS X Mavericks startup Apple logo location Where is the gray Apple logo shown on system startup stored in OS X Mavericks? I'd like to change that image. I know there's BootXChanger that works on older versions of OS X, but it doesn't work on my Mavericks computer.\n\nA: This post explains how to change the logo on the login screen, using a tool like Deeper. Perhaps Deeper can be used for what you are asking about?\n\nA: It's not just as simple as that.\nAs the system boots, it loads the first partition, which just happens to be the EFI partition. This holds the firmware for booting the machine. The Apple logo is stored in this firmware. Modifying it is theoretically possible, but for someone other than a senior Apple engineer it would almost certainly brick the computer. Better just sticking to the boring grey logo. This post here talks about the startup chimes and the same applies to the logo.\n", "Q: How to make certain keystoke in AppleScript?

However, I was wondering if what I'm experiencing is signs of ssd failure. I have a 128gb ssd in the rig for the os, applications and active projects. Over the past 2 months the drive has been slowly losing free space. I first chalked it up to filling it with projects but all of a sudden it has 100gb used so I check how big my projects and applications are and they are 30gb. I know the os isn't 70gb so I was wondering if this may be a sign of a failing ssd or if it may be something else.\n\nA: TRIM isn't enabled on non-Apple OEM SSDs in OSX.  Perhaps garbage collection is not happening.  You can find a lot of sites that explain how to enable TRIM in OSX.  I haven't provided a link as they are plentiful and you may wish to use a site you're more comfortable with.  Use keywords: \"enable trim support OSX terminal\"\nThis link explains it but you should not need the freeware tool that the article mentions.  You can enable it from terminal with a few commands. \n\nA: Thank you everyone for your answers. It turns out the majority of the usage was coming from /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/Media Cache Files(several websites explained this folder can easily sneak its way up to 30gb) which had an Alias setup by another user. The alias was pointing to the other 1tb hard drive but for some reason the disc utility thought the space was still being used on the ssd. I've fixed the issue and put up a symlink instead and now everything is behaving as it should.\n", "Q: Magic Puzzle won't work after I downloaded an update to it, can I uninstall the update Magic Puzzle won't work after I downloaded an update to it on my IPad, can I uninstall the update.

Then I use the GoodReader app to run a server (this is a GoodReader feature) on my iPhone to which I can connect over my ad-hoc network by doing Go > Connect to Server... in Finder on my Mac. Once mounted, I can manipulate files in the GoodReader app storage just like a local folder on my Mac. From the Good Reader app I can then upload my files to Dropbox which syncs with my online storage and have access to the files online.\n\nWhat I Want:\nI want to find an app for my iPhone that will run a file server of some sort to which I can connect with my Mac. I want that app to then transfer files to an online file server (preferably using SFTP), automatically (or with minimal manual help). In essence this would have the effect of me being able to upload files over SFTP to a remote location using a Mac that is offline with an iPhone that is online. I'm basically looking for an alternative to tethering. The Mac -> GoodReader -> Dropbox -> Internet example proves this is possible but it has too many manual steps. I want something more streamlined.\nDo you know of any apps or techniques that can work for me?\n\nA: I have found a few apps in the App Store that claim to be both an FTP client and server. That means you can run a server on an iPhone, connect to it from a Mac, transfer files to my phone, and then to a remote server (or vice versa). This would greatly simplify the process.\nThe apps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*FTP On The Go Pro\n\n*Easy FTP Pro\n\n*FilesConnect\n\n*FTPManager\n\n*iStorage 2\n\n\nI believe there are others but these clearly explained that they include a server and client.\n", "Q: Problems With Terminal (/usr/bin) I'm experimenting around with my computer and I realized that all the commands in the terminal that aren't bash builtins were stored in the /usr/bin. So I wanted to see (to confirm my realization) that they would not work in Terminal if they weren't there. So I copied bin to my desktop and deleted bin in usr. Sure enough, I was right. All the builtins still worked but things like 'say' didn't. Feeling content with myself for figuring out something about my computer, I promptly placed bin back in usr and check to see if 'say' was working to confirm no harm was done. It worked. Then some time later I need to use sudo for something and I get an error. I restarted my computer, hoping that would help. Now I can't even use Terminal anymore. When I boot it up it says:\nLast login: Fri Jul 25 01:12:20 on console\nlogin(529,0x7fff744b4310) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fcfa3600e20: pointer being freed was not allocated\n*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug\n\n[Process completed]\n\nUh-oh, so how do I fix this? The only thing my non-educated brain can think of is a reinstall of OS X.\n\nA: I figured it out by searching it myself (sorry for not thinking of that first). You just go to the disk utility and click 'Repair Disk Permissions'.\n", "Q: Make the green full screen window icon on Yosemite maximize windows On Mac OS X Yosemite the green icon in every window:\n\nis by default used to make the application full screen.\nHow do I make it work the same way as in previous versions of Mac OS X, i.e. to maximize the window?\n\nA: @Wladimir Palant has a great solution, using BetterTouchTool to reassign the role of the green button. Works for me!  \nNote: @Wladimir's answer actually solves this question, not the one he posted in.\n\nA: Disable option \"Double-click a window's title bar to minimize\" in Settings -> Dock. Now you can use double click on the window's title to maximize it.\n\nA: Zoom function can now be performed more easily — by double-clicking window title. You don't need to precisely aim at the small green button anymore, which I believe is the reason it has been converted into full screen button by default.\nIf you hold the shift key and double-click the window title Applications that use \"smart zoom\" will be forced to do full screen zoom. Smart zoom was a (much missed) OS X window behavior where, rather than fill all of an immense display, the window would enlarge based on its \"needs\". Apple removed smart zoom behavior form its own apps, but Chrome still does this. \nSo, in general, make the painful switch to working with the title bar and ignore the green button except for the rare times you truly want full screen. If you get 'smart zoom' and want to fill screen instead, repeat but hold shift key.\n\nA: I've already posted in a similar topic - Check out the free\"spectacle\" that has a bunch of handy window management shortcuts.. Running that app adds cmd+option+F for true full screen with status bar.\nPS. I really hate that instead of adding the \"option\" key for the current maximize to full screen behavior they just replaced the button that people used for years. \nPPS. I tried double clicking windows, it does not work as expected, at best it somehow resizes the screen, so it's maximum height, but it does not fill the entire width of the screen. A chrome window with tabs ignores double clicks. \nPPPS. Option+click does not work as expected either - it does the same thing as double clicking the window - the window resizes in vertical direction, but not in horizontal one. (I have two monitor system, and it does not fill either one of them).\n\nA: As the below mentioned solution is application-based (i.e. only works for apps like Google Chrome), another way to approach this problem is to ignore the maximize button entirely and to install the open source app spectacle which offers the keyboard shortcut:\n⌘ + ⌥ + F\nIt also has some other nice features, too. And it works for all apps.\n\nIn order to maximize the window so that it fills the visible window content, use:\n⌥ + Click on green icon\nIn order to maximize the window both in width and height to the current desktop for applications like Google Chrome use:\n⌥ + ⇧ + Click on green icon\nYou notice the change of behaviour of the button in the way it changes its content from two the arrows to a plus sign.\n\nA: Hold option and left click the green button to have it maximize but not go to full screen. \n\nA: So, pre yosemite, holding \"Shift + Left Click\" would alternate between the current dimensions and what they'd be if you were to maximize the window to the fully available dimensions.\nThe \"Option + Left Click\" alternates between window sizes (the last and the full-height of the screen (less the dock). Also, regardless of where the page is focused, after using the option click, the focus reverts to the upper left of the page (fun-fact).\nAnother thing to note is if you have more than one window open the \"option + left-click\" will maximize the secondary window, and depending its current dimensions, adhere to the same scale as if you were to hold down the Option key when click-dragging the corner of the window to manually resize the frame (scales on a fixed ratio).\nTo answer your question try \"Option + Left-click\" and/or \"Shift + Left-click\". Then perhaps try them together ;)\n", "Q: Image Capture doesn't recognize iPhone 4S Image Capture doesn't recognize iPhone 4S. I'm using OS X Mavericks and iPhone 4S 64 GB with latest iOS 7.1.2\niTunes detects the phone and can perform a backup. iPhoto and Image Capture do not see the phone at all. \nI'm using an original Apple cable and the phone is not modded in any way.\n\nA: If you have a lock screen password/code etc. then you first have to connect your iPhone to the iTunes on your computer. The two will then perform a handshake where you will unlock you phone and say Yes to a notification on your phone asking you whether or not to trust this computer.\nAs far as I'm aware, the issue that you were having is that Image Capture does not perform this required handshake, so the phone doesn't know to trust this computer until you connect it through iTunes. PS. You should only need to do this once, after that it should work without iTunes, but don't quote me on that.\nAs to why iExplore worked, I'm just guessing, but they've been known for finding really cool loop holes in iOS for years, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is just another sweet trick they found. Or most likely they just do the an iTunes-like handshake. ;)\n\nA: I had this problem (in Yosemite, iPhone 4S) and got it working. The solution is based on what appears to be a dependency that Image Capture has on iPhoto. In my case the issue was that upon upgrading the OS, my version of iPhoto was not compatible with it. I updated iPhoto to a compatible version, and now Image Capture again recognizes the phone. I hope this is helpful to someone with this issue. \n\nA: TL;DR: Use iExplorer by http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/.\nI solved this by using a work around. Image capture would never work for two reasons. Each of them alone would have made it practically impossible but both conditions together only exacerbated the problem. \n1) My phone had over 28,000 images. Even using a MacBook Pro maxed out it would not recognized the iPhone. \n2) There were images downloaded form the internet that included different formats not created by the iPhone's camera. \nAfter several hours of trying different things and scouring the internet I was not able to get it to work. I decided to plug in iExplorer (note: this is not an add for iExplorer and I'm not getting anything of posting this. I already had this program.) iExplorer lets you browse the images like a drive. As you can imagine it took a very long while to copy over 28k images to the computer. Heck, when it was done I rebooted the phone. I had to manually clean up the images. It took a long while. When I was done deleting the images manually, I rebooted the iPhone again and then zombie images (I'm not joking) started to show up and the iPhone said restoring even though it was not connected to any computer or internet connection. In total about 3,000 zombie images appeared on the iPhone. I moved those as well. After the clean up and took a couple of screenshots and images and the iPhone was recognized as normal. \nHope this helps. \n- Adam\n\nA: What fixed it for me was using an Apple usb-lighting connector. The cheaper cables purchased at Walgreen's or wherever would charge the device and work with iTunes but the device would NOT appear in Photos.app or Image Capture.\n", "Q: iPhone 5S camera focus Does anyone else often get blurry images when taking photos with iPhone 5S? I just feel they are more frequent than on my iPhone 4 and was wondering if anyone else experienced the same.\n\nA: Blurry photos occur because:\n\n\n*\n\n*skin oil or other cruft (pocket lint) is on the lens\n\n*the camera software is focusing on distant objects (when you want a closeup,) or focusing on close objects (when you want a distant object.)\n\n\nIf you are having trouble focusing, tap in the yellow focus box on the screen. You will notice that the software shows a larger yellow box when it detects a closeup shot, and a smaller box when it detects a distance shot.\n\nA: just tap on the object you want to focus on before taking the picture. if it's still blurry take camera further from object.\n", "Q: Can't download previously purchased app I need to download an app from the iTunes store and have recently changed my Apple ID. I previously purchased this app with my old account and when I try to re-download it the iCloud symbol is the only option available. When I click on the iCloud icon, however, I cannot download it.\n\nA: If as you say, you changed the Apple ID, the stuff from previous Apple ID is NOT accessible with new ID.\nTo get there you must use old Apple ID.\n\nA: When you've bought an app on your ID then delete and then changed the apple ID and try to download it with another ID you can't get it because you bought it on the other ID so you have to download it on your old Apple ID.\n\nA: If by iCloud icon, you mean this:  \n\nThis is the icon that indicates that you have purchased this app already.

I wrote an sandbox specification file (inspired by files from /usr/share/sandbox and manuals like this) and now I can launch some app in sandbox with sandbox-exec $path_to_rules /Applications/$appname.app/Content/.... Fine.\nIs there a way to enforce the rules when the app is started in regular way (Finder's \"Open with...\", etc)?\nI thought about replacing the binary inside .app with wrapper script but it will be overwritten after app update and I will need to restore it every time.\n\nA: Yes, you can change the binary, or even change the Info.plist, but like changing the binary you make will need to do this again each time the app is updated. There's no way to do this without changing the app in a way that won't be overwritten when it's updated.\nYou can automatically make your changes with a Launch Agent.\nSave the following in ~/Library/LaunchAgents as com.yourname.youragent.plist, then run launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourname.youragent.plist.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.yourname.youragent</string>\n        <key>OnDemand</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>Program</key>\n        <string>cp</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/Users/grgarside/test/MyApp</string>\n            <string>/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>WatchPaths</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe above script will watch the WatchPaths for any modifications (in this case, it's watching the binary for an app) and will run cp to copy your binary to the app in /Applications.\n", "Q: see call history from a computer Is there a way to access the call history on an iphone from a computer?\nMy phone has a problem with the display that stops me from using it, it still turns on, but the screen only displays vertical bars, I can tap the screen and it seems to doing something, it makes various sounds that you would expect it to make when tapping the screen, i think i managed to unlock it, but I can't see what is going on.\nI plan to take the phone to someone to see if they can fix the display problem. Until then I would like to retrieve a number from the phone that I most recently called. How can I do this? \nAlso is there a way to redial the previously dialed number, by pressing a combination of buttons without being able to see the screen?\n\nA: Answer for question #2: use Siri and ask \"Redial last number called.\" I use it all the time while driving (with a Bluetooth headset, of course!)\n\nA: Question 1-\nThere are multiple apps available to export your iPhone call log.\nExample: Export iPhone’s call logs to computer for storage\nQuestion 2- TBD..\n", "Q: Set Alias for Terminal Window in Applescript After opening multiple terminal windows and running commands in them, it becomes difficult to send another command to a specific terminal window. \nHow can we set an alias for each terminal window so we can specifically target it later?

Then, under the Window tab select the Command Key check box. This will add a command key to the title bar to instantly switch to that window (so Window titles would have ⌘1, ⌘2, etc. appended to the window title.\n", "Q: Downloaded an app from App Store but it never appeared on my iPod touch I was downloading Clash of Clans. I clicked the download button and it did everything normal. But when it finished, the app never showed up on my iPod touch. So then, I decided to delete it and try again, but there was no deleting option that I could find.\nCan anyone help me?\n\nA: Power off your device and try opening the game first after the device starts from a clean boot.\nIf that doesn't work, you'll have to find the app on the home screen and delete it.\nHere is Apple's KB on troubleshooting apps that don't open:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1702\nFeel free to ask a second question if you can't use that document to solve your Clash of Clans issue.\n", "Q: Open custom file with keyboard shortcut On my Mac, I have some applications that were recently made in Java that I will be using quite alot.

Then I clicked Install OSX Mavericks and selected the SSD. After 13 minutes, the blue bar is complete, and on top, it says: 'Preparing to install. Your computer will restart automatically.'. Below the blue bar, it says 'About a second remaining'. \n\nIt's stuck on this state, with the mouse on the spinning wheel mode, for over a full hour. I'm really starting to worry. \nI looked online and found a guy with a similar problem, but he only waited for half an hour. What should I do? Thanks!\n\nA: I was worried about the same, until it finally went through. I opened the log and it was getting a lot of errors, but while I was reading about this on another computer, it suddenly finished with a message that everything was copied and it automatically rebooted. I was performing a clean install of El Capitan on a new Samsung 850 EVO SSD on my MacBook Pro 13\" mid 2012. I guess the key here is just to be patient.\n\nA: The problem with the upgrade script is the timing only estimates how long it takes for Apple's software to install.\nYou can (and should) open the log file while upgrading/installing and press Command-3 to show all logs, not just the errors.\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+L\n\n*⌘+3\nYou can see that during this \"about a second\" it's really migrating user files and handling all the things you've brought to the Mac that isn't part of the base system.\nBasically, let it run as long as you can stand - especially if the log file shows progress being made. If progress isn’t being made, consider connecting to the internet via a wired connection if possible or making sure the wireless network is operational before interrupting what looks to be a paused or stopped installation. \n\nA: I had the same one second remaining and the log said it was trying to verify the installer. I plugged in my ethernet cable and couple minutes later it finished.\n\nA: I had this problem and realized it was because I was not connected to the internet.  Connect to either WIFI or plug in an ethernet cable and the install will finish in a few mins.\n\nA: I used a flash stick, erased the MacBook's drive, went ahead with the install, and I get this seemingly eternal wait while it says \"about a second remaining\" ... so it can't be migrating files or anything.\n\nA: I had the same issue on a Mid-2011 iMac 27 inch.  New Hybrid HDD.  I tried to install El Capitan from a USB drive and it would get stuck at \"1 second remaining\" with an error in the log.  I rebooted and held down command-r.  This loaded the internet restore, and let me install OS X Lion.  Once Lion installed I was able to use the app store to install El Capitan.\n\nA: Just wait even if you erased the drive completely for installing it takes several minutes not seconds to prepare the system for installation I had the same issue it cleared itself out opening the log helps to see the process isn't stuck you could actually see it working \n\nA: I had the same issue. The first time I thought it was frozen, after waiting about 35 mins, I shut it down and made a new attempt. This time I just waited for more than 14 minutes and the reboot worked fine. Just be patient. (Instaling El Capitan from a memory stick onto a new SSD Samsung EVO 850 hard drive with an iMac 21 mid-2011.)\n\nA: I did a clean install on a brand new SSD and had the same problem. To resolve this, when it says \"about a second remaining\" just leave it and it will finish eventually (mine took almost 4 hours). Worst thing you can do is keep trying over and over again as you'll just be wasting your time. It will finish the installation, even if it has errors :)\n\nA: I had this for about an hour, then noticed the WiFi symbol in the top right had disconnected from my network (greyed out). I reconnected to the same network I'd connected to when starting the installation, and it continued installing.\n\nA: Had the same issue.\nThe installation can be sped up by deleting files stored in /usr/local/bin. (by rm -rf /usr/local/bin in Terminal app)\nIt went even faster for me by using a USB stick with OS X and erasing the disk before installation. For USB stick (need stick > 8GB) see: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201372\nAfter reboot press alt then select the USB stick, then select Utilities → Disk Utilities.\nHere you can erase your disk (careful not to erase the stick!) and format it as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nNow just continue the install process (5 minutes for me, after previous 8h+ aborted).\nWorked with Yosemite 10.10.4 Beta\n", "Q: Are there any options for IOS development on Windows 8? (Apps, Emulators, Cloud Computing OK) I am trying to develop iPhone apps on Windows 8. To do that, I might need an emulator to run certain IOS development programs. \nI would like to know if there are any OS-X emulators available for Windows and which ones are to be recommended? Please note that I am willing to pay for the emulators (doesn't necessarily have to be free).\nIf emulators aren't an option, I'm also willing to use cloud-computing, provided it works.\nI just came across a service called macincloud.com, which supposedly allows you to rent a Mac-OS server.\nI am willing to invest in this, which costs $20/month, so I seriously need to know if this is legit or not. I am not willing to pony up money for something that's unreliable.\nPlease tell me your thoughts on that service.\nIf none of those options are possible, are there any options that allow me to develop AND preview the app using Windows without submitting the product to Apple?\nThanks.\n\nA: According to the license for OS X, you are not allowed to run it on non-Apple hardware.\nIf any emulators do exist, or methods to hack existing virtualization software to run it on non-Apple hardware, that would not be legal.\nLegally, you could technically buy some Apple hardware like an iMac or Mac Pro, install Windows on it, and then run virtualized OS X within Windows, but I'm not certain virtualization software that will do this exists.\nThe only virtualization system I know of that supports OS X is VMWare ESXi, but I believe that's a bare-metal hypervisor that won't run on Windows.\nYou will probably be best served by buying a Mac Mini and either KVMing it or connecting to it with VNC.\nEDIT:\nYou mentioned http://www.macincloud.com -- I can't speak to the reputability of that particular business, but the premise is sound. They could be running multiple instances of OS X on ESXi hypervisor running on Mac Pro or Mac mini server hardware, or they could be renting out individual Mac mini servers -- making each instance accessible over VNC.\nHere are two articles that may give some credit to MacinCloud's reliability:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://coronalabs.com/blog/2012/03/15/corona-developers-rent-a-mac-in-the-cloud/\n\n*http://gizmodo.com/5853926/join-a-mac-timeshare-in-the-clouds\n"]
