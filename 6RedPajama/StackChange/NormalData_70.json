["Q: Apple Watch Screenshot not saving on iPhone I have a Series 4 Apple Watch, but I cannot seem to get the screenshot feature to work. The steps I have taken are:\n\n*\n\n*Enable screenshots through the watch app on my iPhone\n\n*Restart watch\n\n*Restart phone\n\n*Screenshot by pressing the digital crown and side button\n\nWhen I try to take a screenshot, both the watch and my phone vibrate, but the photos do not appear in the photos app on my phone.\nMy iPhone OS is iOS 12.3.1 and my Watch OS is 5.1.3 (needs to be updated)\n\nA: Oddly enough, just waiting has resolved this issue for me. \nIt seems to have fixed itself.\n\nA: I had the exact same problem (though with Series 8 Watch paired with iPhone 13) and spent hours with Apple support trying to resolve the issue.\nIn the end I discovered by chance (during a demo to the remote support engineer via camera) that pressing and releasing the two buttons really quickly made it work... holding down for even half a second before releasing, and it doesn't work... with a longer press/release, sometimes the watch and phone would both vibrate (as if it's doing something) but then no screenshot would appear on the phone.\nBut ensuring a very quick press/release made it work (watch screen flashes, which it wasn't before).\nWhy can't they make this clear in the guide, and why did nobody from support know to suggest this?  Certainly, on the iPhone itself, you can hold both buttons down for a while and then release, and the screenshot is effective still... but on the Watch (my Series 8 anyway)... it needs to be a very quick press/release.\n\nA: In the Photos app on your iPhone:\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap the 'Albums' tab.\n\n*Tap 'Screenshots'.\n\n*Scroll to the bottom of the list, your AW screenshots will be there.\n\n", "Q: How to create installable app with setuid bit set owned by root I have inherited a codebase that needs updating, but I don't have the build scripts that created the final pkg file. \nThe code needs to access a connected USB device (treated as a drive) to read and write bits to, and so it needs escalated privelidges. Due to the non technical nature of the end users, they need to be able to click on the app, and can't be expected to run it from the command line with sudo.\nThe current installer installs to /Applications/myapp.app, with myapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp being set to -rwsr-xr-x root:staff permissions. When installed, this app runs just fine without complaint.\nI managed to make a similar pkg file using pkgbuild, and it creates a similar folder in /Applications, with the same permissions, newapp.app/Contents/MacOS/newapp -rwsr-xr-x root:staff. But if I try to run the app without sudo, then I get \"The application with bundle ID newapp is running setugid(), which is not allowed.\"\nThe mac I have is running macos 10.13.6\nThe app is python that have been packaged into a binary.\nHow am I supposed to package this code so it runs as root after it's been installed?\n\nA: This is just the task suite to a shell script to be packaged with your installer package.  \nJust package all your files as you do and then review this script only package. Since there are no files, all the steps in this guide will show you how to craft the post install script. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/creating-payload-free-packages-with-pkgbuild/\n\n*http://macinstallers.blogspot.com/2012/07/scripting-in-installer-packages.html\n\n*Configure the OS X Server from .pkg postinstall script\nThe first guide is the densest, so read it and then hit up the next links, then return to the first for when you’re ready to use pkgbuild tool to install and script. \n", "Q: Adding social media icons to email signature apple mail with url or SVG, not by attachment \nlink to LinkedIn banner\nI want to add a LinkedIn badge in my email signature.\nHowever, even if I drag-drop from the browser, It is inserted as an attachment, which is personally super annoying.\nIs there a way to insert it to be loaded directly from the source from the web? So, as if  tag in website.\nI tried to copy+paste it from web format. It worked for email content but didn't work for signature.\nSince it was possible for content, it doesn't seem impossible for mail but can't find how to do it.\n+) if it can be done with SVG, it will be even better.\n\nA: So, to my knowledge SVG isn't possible in HTML email. As I understand it you have to create a placeholder signature and then find the .mailsignature file in your system. This will be in the iCloud folder on more recent systems and in the Library folder on older systems. From there you should be able to replace the <body></body> tags in the signature file leave the header as is. The process is a little more complex, as you'll have to make sure your signatures aren't using the default font and that you configure your text editor to open as unformatted HTML. There's nuances to the process, but there should be no reason you couldn't use an URL for an image. They will get treated as attachments unfortunately regardless of how you add it I believe, and you can't really do much about how the signature looks past the first time it is delivered. Good luck and I hope this helps.\n\nA: You can add HTML img tags (linking to your social images) by manually editing your Mail.app email signature files. These will NOT show as an attachment on the recipient's email. Of course these will only work if the recipient's email client loads remote images.\nSignature Location\nThe .mailsignature files will be in one of two locations depending on whether or not the email using the signature is an iCloud account.\nIf the account is an iCloud account, the .mailsignature files can be found here:\n~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/MailData/Signatures/\nIf the account is not iCloud, the .mailsignature files can be found here:\n~/Library/Mail/<Vx>/MailData/Signatures/ (where <Vx> is a version dependent on your current install, in Mojave mine is V6).\nEditing .mailsignature Files\nYou may want to create a new signature (and associate it to your desired account). It will then show in these folders as the most recently modified .mailsignature.\nEdit this file in a text editor that can view the HTML code (replace anything in the  tags below the \"Mime-version: ...\" line).\nFor the simplest example, your file could look like:\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-Type: text/html;\n    charset=us-ascii\nMessage-Id: <C29....>\nMime-Version: 1.0 (Mac OS X Mail 12.4 \\(3445.104.11\\))\n\n<body><img src=\"http://www.example.com/remote_image.jpg\" /></body>\n\n\nImportant Note for non-iCloud Accounts\nIf you're not using an iCloud email account, you MUST lock the .mailsignature files after editing, or they will be overridden.\nUsing the .mailsignature Files\nOnce you've edited the .mailsignature file, quit Mail and reopen. You can now select the .mailsignature you edited. \nNOTE: Images from  tags will not appear in either the compose window or in the Signatures tab of Mail preferences, but they WILL appear in messages you send (if the recipient loads remote images).\n", "Q: Time Machine backup will not restore to my internal HDD drive I had a major hard drive failure, so I have replaced the HDD on my MacBook mid 2012 13\" model with another 1TB. I was running latest version of \"Mojave\" MacOS.\nI go to restore from the time machine (TM) backup and I am being told that it will only now restore to an SSD drive because APFS systems can only be restored to SSDs. I wasn't even aware that my Time Machine was doing backups in APFS.\nSo I am really stuck here. Is this Apple's very unsubtle way of telling me to buy a new MacBook with an SSD drive to be able to keep using TM backups and other system features? Like planned obsolescence? Or have I done something wrong? The full message that comes up when I do the CMS + R recovery boot and try to restore from TM:\n\nThe system can't be restored onto this disk because APFS systems can\n  only be restored to internal SSDs. Reinstall MacOS on this disk and\n  then use Migration Assistant to transfer data from your backup\n  instead.\n\n\nA: Similar issue. \n\"The system can't be restored onto this disk because HFS systems can't be restored to space sharing APFS volumes.  Reinstall macOS on this disk and then use Migration Assistant to transfer data from your backup assistant.\"\nI think the \"accidental\" disconnect from Time Machine backups due to HFS/APFS incompatibility was intentional.\n\nA: i suffered same problem but took me only a while to realise a solution, Just use 2 external hdd usb connectors and connect both the Backup HDD and new HDD simultaneously, then boot the macbook into internet recovery then take it from there. It worked for me and i was able to restore to my new 1TB HDD. NB: I didnt use internet recovery cos i already have a third hdd around that had macos installed so i just booted it into recovery mode after inserting it inside the macbook. Another suggestion is always keep a backed up recovery boot on a small USB stick, i have Recovery Partition on a 2GB pendrive and i can always boot into recovery with it\n\nA: If you cannot get more than 1 exeternal connectors just remove the new HDD from the MacBook and insert the time Machine backup inside instead then connect the new HDD via external and boot into internet recovery and go from there to restore your OS to the external HDD... that should work too\n", "Q: Cross button on iPhone app icon doesn't appear when trying to uninstall When I tap and hold on an app icon on my iPhone to uninstall it, the ⓧ button  do not appear for certain apps. As far as I recall, the apps in question were installed using a different Apple ID which I have since removed from my iPhone.\nI also tried uninstalling by going to Settings app → General → iPhone Storage → App Name, but couldn't find the Delete App option even there.\nThis is a company owned iPhone 5s running iOS 12.3.1. The device remotely managed. The apps in question are not managed and were installed using a personal ID.\n\nA: Screen Time settings were preventing the app from being uninstalled from my iPhone. The setting can be found by going to Settings app → Screen Time → Content & Privacy Restrictions → iTunes & App Store Purchases → Deleting Apps. The setting was set to Don't Allow.\n\nAs soon as the setting was changed to Allow (default value), I was able to uninstall apps normally and the ⓧ button appeared on the app icons when I tap and hold my finger.\nWhen uninstalling an iPhone app, it doesn't matter if it was installed using the currently logged in Apple ID or using an Apple ID that has since been removed from the iPhone.\n", "Q: External disk does not show in \"diskutil list\" after premature eject, what can I do? This question is related to External drive does not mount after plug off without eject, but the difference is that in my case, the drive did not appear in the Disk Utility application nor in diskutil list. Furthermore, I had a strong suspicion that the problem was caused by a poweroff while the external drive wasn't (fully) unmounted, because Finder was showing a warning about disconnecting before unmounting for both partitions of the drive.\nWhen I switched it on, the drive would briefly spin up and then spin down again, but none of the software on my mac would confirm that it was connected.\nThere are lots of (free) tools available online that promise to help with recovering compromised disks, including some that are provided by disk manufacturers. However, in this case, none of the programs I could find appealed to me, for at least one of the following reasons in each case:\n\n\n*\n\n*It is only for Windows, or it requires creating a bootable flash drive before you can run it.\n\n*Its documentation does not clearly state that it will be able to find a disk that doesn't already show up on your mac.\n\n\nI'm asking this question retroactively to share the solution I found. If you know of a different solution that worked in your case, please feel welcome to share as well!\n\nA: Reading the man page of diskutil, I found a command that I thought might provide at least some diagnostics on what was wrong:\ndiskutil activity\n\nWhen you run this command, it will start monitoring all disk activity and report back to you until you stop it again.\nI ran this command and switched off the bricked external drive. Nothing happened.\nI switched the external drive back on while the command was still running. Now, I saw the following sequence of events repeat several times (leaving out the information that came with the events):\n***DiskPeek\n***DiskAppeared\n***DiskMountApproval\n\nand finally a few times\n***DiskDescriptionChanged\n\nfollowed by\n***DAIdle\n\nwhich was also the last event before I switched the drive back on.\nThis seemed promising, so I took a peek in the Finder and lo and behold, both partitions of the drive were there!\nThis was my first attempt to mount the disk while running diskutil activity and the third attempt in total since the problem started. I don't know whether diskutil activity actually fixed the problem or that this was just my \"lucky try\", but if you run into the same problem as I did, at least this is something you can try!\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: Battery icon shows as charging even when not connected to power source I have a 13\" 2017 MacBook Pro no Touch Bar model. It is not connected to a power source but it still shows as charging. While this is not affecting my Mac's performance or anything, but now I don't get that low battery warning when the charge reaches 5% or low, so it just shuts down at 0% without me realising it.\nI tried starting it in Safe Mode, but the issue is present there as well.\n\n\n\nA: For me I didn't have to do the SMC reset.\nOn the SMC reset instructions page, these steps were sufficient:  \n\nNotebook computers with the T2 chip\n    Before resetting the SMC, try\n  these steps:\nShut down your Mac.\n  Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds,\n  then release the button.\n  Wait a few seconds, then press the power\n  button to turn on your Mac.\n\nI am running on a MacBook Pro with the T2 chip.  \n\nA: For me the SMC reset worked like a charm. Thanks n1000.\nFor those facing the same problem who don't know how to perform an SMC reset you have to turn off completely your mac, then hold the three keys Shift + Ctrl + Alt (all on the left side of the keyboard) + power button for 10 seconds, and voilà you can turn on again your MacBook, hopefully solving the problem as it happened to me. \nP.s. this SMC reset method is for MacBooks produced before 2018 (T1 security chip); for the T2 security chip the process is slightly different, you can find all the information here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295\n\nA: Same issue here.\nI took it to applestore and the voltage sensor was broken.

The Springboard on my Late 2018 iPad Pro and now iPhone (as of the last month), crashes between every 20 minutes to 3 hours. I run iOS 13.2.3\nThe screen goes black, the spinning wheel appears, continues for about 6 seconds and then the Home screen reappears. Any app that I launch reloads.\nI've have the same case number with multiple Apple Senior Advisors since February and they simply can't figure it out. They have already replaced the iPad as a possible solution. They sent in my log files from an Apple profile to the iCloud team. They've had the log files for 2 months and have never replied. Obviously they're lost too.\nI've done every normal troubleshooting step under the sun, resetting to factory settings, putting it in recovery mode from iTunes and rebuilding the iPad from scratch, with no iCloud restore. I even signed in with a different, new Apple ID to test that. No joy, it still crashes.\nI believe I've narrowed down the cause: corrupted iCloud library folders/files because iCloud on a Mac syncs to an iOS device.\nSo what's the best way to replace and re-build those? Recovery mode on my iMac and Macbook? A Terminal command?\nI can't use my iPad Pro as a functional daily driver when it keeps crashing when working.  I moved (essentially deleted) several iCloud library folders on my Macbook and my iPad continues to crash.\nWhat steps can be done to isolate or fix this crashing?\n\nA: Problem solved.\nThe corrupt data lived in Safari's History and Website Data. It was transferring the data between devices through my Apple ID. \nI went to settings on my iPad, Safari, \"Clear History and Website Data.\"\n", "Q: Make Mac eject external drives when going to slumber or sleep/wake I have an external drive, a \"Western Digital My Passport for Mac\". I usually leave it connected and walk away from my MacBook Pro. The Mac often went to slumber and many times the \"not properly ejected\" message pops up. Being used to Windows I just clicked it away. Windows often gives errors that have no consequences. Until at one time the disc stopped mounting. I can't help but think that that is connected to the error and lack of ejecting properly.\nIs there a way to have the Mac eject USB drives safely when it goes to sleep? Either of it's own accord or even when I have it go to slumber or close the lid?\nIt's just very cumbersome to have to eject the drive every time I walk away. Having a very chaotic nature doesn't help with that sort of thing.\nBTW, just yesterday I got the drive to mount read-only through the macOS Disc Uility app. So I salvaged my files. Would still rather not have that again, because the drive contained some photo's that weren't yet backed up. BTW, the error it displays is with the volume selected (disk passes the first test):\nSchijf-EHBO uitvoeren op 'My Passport for Mac' (disk2s2)\n\nBestandssysteem herstellen.\nHet volume is al gedeactiveerd.\nfsck_hfs -fy -x /dev/rdisk2s2 uitvoeren\nEindcode bestandssysteem is 8.\nDe oorspronkelijke status wordt teruggezet naar gedeactiveerd.\nControle of herstel van bestandssysteem mislukt.\n\nBewerking mislukt…\n\nA Google Translate, in English, of the message above:\nPerform disk first aid on 'My Passport for Mac' (disk2s2)\n\nRestore file system.\nThe volume has already been deactivated.\nRun fsck_hfs -fy -x / dev / rdisk2s2\nFile code final code is 8.\nThe original status is reset to deactivated.\nFile system check or restore failed.\n\nOperation failed ...\n\n\nA: There's a 3rd party app available for exactly this purpose. Jettison app automatically ejects your external drives when you put your MacBook to sleep.\nIt is a paid app with 15 days of free trial available.\n\nA: There may be a native way to accomplish your goal; however I do not know how and why I use EventScripts, which among the events it can react to, Computer will sleep and Computer wakes could be use to unmount/remount an attached USB Drive using AppleScripts, shell scripts and or Automator workflows.\nYou can download the demo version from the developers web site. The app costs $3.99 USD in the App Store in the USA.\n\nNote that I am a paid customer and have no other affiliation with Mousedown Software, the developer of EventScripts.\n\nA: Jettison is an excellent recommendation, and probably the one I would make for most people.\nHowever, if you want to get into all sorts of Mac automation, you'll definitely want to checkout Keyboard Maestro. You can create a macro that will run when the system goes to sleep, and have that macro run a simple shell script like this:\n#!/bin/zsh -f \n\nMNTPNT='/Volumes/Western Digital My Passport for Mac'\n\nCOUNT='0'\n\nwhile [[ -e \"$MNTPNT\" ]]\ndo\n\n     /usr/sbin/diskutil unmount \"$MNTPNT\"\n\n     ((COUNT++))\n\n     [ \"$COUNT\" -ge \"10\" ] && exit 0\n\ndone\n\nexit 0\n\n\nthat will check to see if the drive is mounted, and if it is, it will try to unmount it. \nIn fact, it will keep trying if it doesn't succeed. \nKeyboard Maestro says that it will only delay sleep for a maximum of 30 seconds, but I added a counter that will give up after 10 tries, because if it hasn't worked by then, it probably isn't going to work.\nAnyway, just to show that there are other ways of doing it.\nI assume there's a way to try with AppleScript as well, which Keyboard Maestro could also do, but I know shell scripting better than AppleScript.\n", "Q: Launching a specific web page from iOS home screen I want to create an app icon on my iOS home screen that launches a particular web page in a browser when it is tapped. In other words, it should look visually like an app, but I don't want to have to code an app. I don't want to have to launch a browser and open a bookmark each time I want to visit that web page.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: Safari, the default browser available in iOS has a feature that lets you add a website bookmark to your Home Screen.\nThe bookmark visually looks like an app icon and when tapped, opens the webpage in Safari. The website favicon is used to represent the app icon. However, unlike Safari bookmarks which syncs across all your Apple devices, this one appears only on the iOS device that you add it on.\nTo add a webpage bookmark on your iOS Home screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the webpage in Safari.\n\n\n*Tap on the Share button. In the bottom row, tap on Add to Home Screen\n\n\n*If needed, edit the name of shown below the bookmark icon. Webpage title is used by default.\n\n\n*Tap Add and you are done.

I was shocked to just find that the Wi-Fi process on my brand new macbook pro is sucking up 3.4 GB of memory. Why is that and how do I reclaim it? I reviewed a few other questions here about this but they don't have helpful answers.\nRunning Mojave 10.14.5 (18F203)\n\n\nThat 11282 ports looks suspicious. I'd like my memory back, appreciate your suggestions.\nEdit: here is the memory pressure graph:\n\nUptime 3 days and have been using wifi hotspot a lot (while I wait here for AT&T home internet install...)\n\nA: First thing first - memory is virtual, so Wi-Fi could take 100 GB and you might only have a low grade leak that seems bad, but in practice has no effect whatsoever over a two week period or longer.\nHere how I’d evaluate this measurement in context :\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the overall memory pressure graph like on the machine?\n\n*How long after you started did it take to get to that status?\n\n\nNow that you have some data points and can agree that the numbers mean less without context, here’s how to reclaim that memory.\nOnce you get the data above, log out (Apple Menu - log out Michael, then log back in). The ports and memory should start very small.\nI haven’t seen this cause issues across our production fleet and there is speculation that IPv6 networking or iPhone tethering can cause this higher than expected, but not impacting performance level of allocations. Also, people that tend to have dozens or a score of tabs open in multiple browsers would likely have a lot of memory to track that. Lastly, not logging out regularly would allow this to grow if it’s a leak / usage situation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Wi-Fi taking up lot of memory\nAs to the ultimate question of why, you have nailed the ports being the reason for this process. In the Mach kernel architecture, ports are how processes communicate, so every program that needs any network access or to send a communication to another process, needs ports to queue and deliver and secure those network data chunks. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Mach/Mach.html\nThe Wi-Fi program is doing its sole function which is to connect your programs in your user space to the system/kernel that then runs the network drivers and does the communication with the hardware layer. \nI see nothing shocking here, but here's the low down on using vmmap and heap to pick apart why yours is using less memory when you log in (and almost none if you start no apps at log in) and then when you run your programs that assign work to Wi-Fi - it allocates memory to do that work you asked of the wireless networking system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is my Wi-Fi Process eating >2GB memory\n", "Q: macOS: List apps authorized for full disk access Is there a Terminal command to view a list of all macOS that are authorized and unauthorized but have asked for Full Access?\nI am looking for the list that is displayed under System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Full Disk Access, but via command-line.\n\nA: Building on @d4's answer, the sqlite DB does have the answer for which permission is granted. The service column will be kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles for Full Disk Access.\nSo the query:\nsqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db \\\n  'select client from access where auth_value and service = \"kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles\"'\n\nwill list out the apps and binaries that are allowed Full Disk Access, i.e.:\n/usr/libexec/atrun\n/usr/sbin/sshd\ncom.googlecode.iterm2\n\n(Updated answer based on @Motti Shneor answers, thanks! On their answer they note that auth_value is an int and not a bool, but the WHERE filter still works.)\n\nIf you're interested, you can invert the query to ... where NOT auth_value and service = ... and it will list the apps that are unchecked in the policy dialog.\n\nOn older versions of macOS (before 11.6) the auth_value column was named allowed so you might need to adjust the query.\n\nIf you get the error Error: unable to open database \"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\": authorization denied and any other file operations on the TCC.db file all fail, your terminal app itself is missing the full disk access permission required to read the DB file. i.e. I can't run the command from vscode but it works from iTerm because that's how my permissions are set up. That's addressed in rdamazio's answer.\n\nA: The sqlite queries mentioned DO work, e.g.:\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 'select * from access'\n\nThe trick, however, is that you need full-disk access to access that SQLite database, so depending on where you're trying to do this, it's a chicken-and-egg problem. For just testing purposes, you can give your terminal full-disk access, then you'll be able to run the command.\n\nA: Apps that have requested and been granted Security > Privacy permissions can be read via:\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 'select * from access'\n\nHowever, this does not specify which permissions were granted.\nThere's also:\ndefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccessAuthWarning.plist\n\n..but this will only indicate whether a given app was approved or denied.\nTaccy is a small utility that will list which permissions an app will request, even if it has not been launched yet: \nhttps://eclecticlight.co/taccy-signet-precize-alifix-utiutility-alisma/\n\nA: Fabio Viola use this command :\nsudo sqlite3 \"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\" 'UPDATE access SET allowed = \"1\";'\n\n1 is for granting access and 0 is for declining access.\nI hope this may work.\n\nA: The database\n\"/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db\"\n\nis protected via SIP on Mojave and cannot be opened by the command given in this answer unless you give full disk access to the Terminal app itself as noted in this answer.\nI copied the file in a test folder and then opened it using a GUI app: DB browser for sqlite.app. You may use other apps too if you want.\nNot affiliated with the app.\n\nA: following previous good answers, that are regretfully outdated, I looked at a modern MacOS (Monterey 12.0.1) version of the TCC database, and finally found the following command:\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 'select client,auth_value from access where service = \"kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles\"'\n\nto provide all the info OP asked for. All apps (and also non-app processes) who asked for full-disk-access appear in the list.\nThose without permissions, have the value '0' in their auth_value column, while those with permission - got '2' in that column.\nConnecting the dots to previous answers - the old allowed column was replaced by the auth_value column in the TCC.db schema, and it is no longer a Boolean, rather an integer - whose values (other than 0 and 2) I do not know.\nAs others mentioned to run this, you must first provide full-disk-access permissions to the terminal app (or whatever app you're using to run this command from)\nHope this helps out anyone...\n", "Q: Sync MP3 files from iTunes on Mac to Apple Music on iPhone I have a MacBook Air running macOS Mojave and an iPhone 6 running iOS 12.\nI have MP3 files from a friend that I put on to my PC using a USB drive. They play fine in iTunes. However, they do not show up in my Apple Music on my iPhone.\nI'm guessing this is because I did not purchase them from the iTunes Store, but I'm not sure why.\nHow do I get the MP3 file from iTunes on my Mac to Apple Music app on my iPhone?\n\nA: duskwuff's answer is correct if you have a subscription to the Apple Music or iTunes Match services. An Apple Music subscription gives you access to the entire Apple Music catalogue from any device signed in to your account; iTunes Match only lets you download a copy of the music you've imported into iTunes on your computer.\nIf you don't subscribe to either service, you should be able to sync MP3 files from the Mac to the iPhone by connecting via USB. Be aware this may remove music that's already on the iPhone, but you'll see a warning first, and if you had bought that music from the iTunes Store you'll be able to redownload it.\n\nA: Make sure that both devices are logged into your Apple ID. This is mostly automatic on the iPhone, but you may need to log into iTunes on the Mac, using the \"Account\" menu.\nOnce you have logged into iTunes, Apple Music will start scanning the music in your iTunes library. Any songs which are available in Apple Music will be added to your iCloud library, and most other songs will be uploaded so that you can play them on any device.\nThis process may take some time, especially if you are on a slow network connection. You can check the progress by clicking the button with the spinning circle icon in the upper right corner of the iTunes window. (The button will disappear once the process is complete -- if all you see is a search box, it's done.)\n", "Q: How to enable logging for smbd on macOS? I would like to enable logging on my file sharing service.

Whenever I use the SVN command-line client on my Mac, it stores the password to os keychains without my permission.\nWhile the immediate issue is with the SVN command-line client, the scope of this question is more general.\nThere are very few situations in which I want a password to reside anyplace either than (a) my head, or (b) an encrypted DMG whose password is saved only in my head.\nOnce this unauthorized password capture has been made, then every single time I access that repository via Subclipse, Keychain butts in, asking me (if I remember right) to deny once, allow once, or allow indefinitely, BEFORE I can reach the Sublclipse sign-on dialog. To prevent this, I have to go into Keychain Access, and delete the record -- which then reappears as soon as I use the command-line SVN client. Thus, Keychain defeats its whole purpose of \"convenience.\"\nHow do I prevent this unauthorized capture and storage? An answer specific to the SVN command-line client would be good; a more general answer would be better.\n\nA: I have managed to find an SVN-specific answer.\nIt seems that the SVN client itself uses whatever password caching functionality is available on the underlying platform, but this can be controlled with a configuration file.\nSpecifically, configuration files for SVN can be found on a Mac or *nix box in the \"invisible\" directory ~/.subversion (i.e., \".subversion\" within your home directory). In the current release, to unconditionally suppress all password caching, go to %/.subversion, and edit the \"servers\" file in the editor of your choice. Find the [global] section, and within it, the commented-out line, \n# store-passwords = no\n\nRemove the pound-sign and the leading space (if you leave the leading space in, the svn client will fail -- I learned this the hard way). The line should now read\nstore-passwords = no\n\nAnd that will unconditionally suppress password caching in the Eclipse client.\n", "Q: Color problem in Terminal (Mojave) I'm using macOS Mojave 10.14.5 and I'm having color problems when accessing a CentOS workstation.\nInitially, after connecting via ssh, I would obtain the following welcome message:\n\nThen I added the following commands to the bash file:\nexport LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n\nand I commented the following line in /etc/ssh/ssh_config:\n# SendEnv LANG LC_*\n\nAfter all this the welcome message I get is without errors but still distorted:\n\nWhat i should get is the following (i got it using iTerm2 3.2.9):\n\nHow can I fix the colors?

OR ..\nuse the internal SSD as a minimal MACOS with bootcamp and then just install a second MACOS on the HDD for my MAC apps.\nCan I do other of these?\nThanks!\nCharles\n\nA: The easiest method to install Windows is to use the Boot Camp Assistant. However this method limits where Windows can be installed. This limitation can be overcome my avoiding the use of the Boot Camp Assistant, but is increases the complexity of the installation process.\nThe Windows installer GUI (Graphical User Interface) can also limit where Windows can be installed. Some of this limitation can be overcome by first running the diskpart command before using the Windows installer GUI or by avoiding the use of the Windows installer GUI altogether and installing Windows by using the CLI (Command Line Interface).\nAn EFI booting of Windows is easier to install than one that uses the legacy BIOS boot method. Your model Mac can use either method. However, the Windows Support Software drivers you download using the Boot Camp Assistant are designed for an EFI booting Windows 10.\nYour comment indicates you are having problems with the Windows installer. Can I assume you were able to create the partitions on the SSD drive using the Boot Camp Assistant and now have booted the Windows installer from the flash drive only to discover the Windows installer will not let you select the SSD drive partition created by the Boot Camp Assistant? Or, other than perhaps using the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software, you are installing Windows without the use of the Boot Camp Assistant application? If the later is true, then could you outline the steps you have taken so far? For example: How did you get the Windows Support Software? If you used a flash drive, then how did you transfer the installation files to this flash drive? If you avoided the use of a flash drive, then where did you put the files the normally a put on the flash drive? Once you have answer these question, I would be better able to offer the steps needed to install Windows 10.\n", "Q: Completely deleting an app from my iPhone to download a clean copy I'm trying to delete the Firstrade (financial brokerage) app from my iPhone 8 (iOS 12.3.1) so that I can re-purchase it cleanly from the App Store.\nI believe the app I originally purchased was somehow corrupted during original download.

This indicates that the app has already been purchased with your Apple ID (This includes free apps. Even free apps are “purchased”, they just have no cost.)

Charles Proxy has a feature that it can automatically configure your system proxy settings when it starts.\nEvery programmatic way I've found of changing these settings (e.g. networksetup) requires raised privileges to use, however this app somehow manages to do this with standard user permissions. The only time it requires raised privileges is on the very first time it runs.\nWhere can its permissions be managed for making changes in future for e.g., making it ask for privileges again? \n\nA: Privileged Helper\nIf Charles Proxy is following Apple's recommendations, the permissions gained during the initial set-up will be encoded as a Privileged Helper.\nOn macOS the folder /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools contains tools that have previously authenticated and authorised with the user.\nThe folder /Library/LaunchDaemons contains the launchd files that launch and determine access to the tools.\nThere are other approaches, such as:\n\nRunning with Elevated Privileges\nIf you do need to run code with elevated privileges, there are several approaches you can take:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*You can run a daemon with elevated privileges that you call on when you need to perform a privileged task. The preferred method of launching a daemon is to use the launchd daemon (see launchd). It is easier to use launchd to launch a daemon and easier to communicate with a daemon than it is to fork your own privileged process.\n  \n*You can use the authopen command to read, create, or update a file (see authopen).\n  \n*You can use a BSD system call to change privilege level (see Calls to Change Privilege Level). These commands have confusing semantics. You must be careful to use them correctly, and it’s very important to check the return values of these calls to make sure they succeeded.\n  \n\n\nA: After more research, I found this Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) description CVE-2017-15358 Local root privesc in Charles Proxy 4.2:\n\nSetting a system-wide proxy requires root permissions so this is handled by an suid binary located within the Charles application folder:\n/Applications/Charles.app/Contents/Resources/Charles Proxy Settings\n  It says that in its first-time setup, Charles Proxy creates a setuid binary that is used on subsequent runs to change the proxy settings.\n\nThe link in Graham's answer points this method out as a legacy way of accomplishing this behaviour and is no longer recommended.\n", "Q: Mac OS Recovery: Disk Utility always partitions SSD I am trying to recover my Mac OS installation.

I am used to just seeing the Macintosh HD. Even if I press erase on the APPLE SSD it still remains in that state and only formats the disk that’s grouped beneath it.

This will entail actually making 4 partitions, 3 of which will be nominally hidden from you.\nIf you don't need or want to see any of this 'under the hood' detail, you can set Disk Utility to only show Volumes, not all devices.\n Cmd ⌘   1  or View Menu > Show Only Volumes will do this for you.\nif you really want to see everything that macOS hides from you, launch Terminal & type diskutil list [this will not change anything, merely allow you to see it] - you'll see 'real' disks & volumes, & also synthesised ones which are virtual but necessary for the smooth operation of the system.\nfor example - \n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         1000.0 GB  disk0s2\n\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +1000.0 GB  disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s2\n   1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            585.5 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 21.2 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                509.3 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      20.5 KB    disk1s4\n\nDespite all this, all you will see in Disk Utility is either just Macintosh HD, or your drive's physical name [APPLE SSD SM056L Media] with [potentially an APFS container if your OS is new enough] & Macintosh HD inside that.\n", "Q: Force a sync of iCloud Keychain from iOS to macOS? My passwords on my iCloud Keychain on my MacBook and iPhone are out of sync. There are several new passwords on each device that aren't present on the other. Following a Google search, I logged out of iCloud on my laptop and logged in again but that didn't work.\nIs there any way I can force a sync?\n\nA: This is how you can force an iCloud keychain sync as per Apple Support document, Get help with iCloud Keychain\n\nIf you want to sync iCloud Keychain with other devices\nMake sure that your new device has the latest version of iOS and the latest version of macOS. Then, make sure that your device is on a Wi-Fi or cellular network. If the connection appears strong, try these steps:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Turn off iCloud Keychain on all devices.\n  \n*Turn on iCloud Keychain on the device that has the most up-to-date keychain items.\n  \n*Turn on iCloud Keychain on your other devices. They will be updated with your new iCloud Keychain.\n\n\nA: I had very little luck with the various Apple approved methods of solving this issue. Nothing would appear on my Macbook’s iCloud Keychain even after very elaborate tricks to turn iCloud Keychain off and on.\nWhat did work was that in frustration I airdropped a single web site password from my iPhone to my Macbook. Subsequently every password appeared in iCloud Keychain on my Mac and subsequent passwords synced over iCloud. (Like the very password saved on this site I just made on my iPhone 5 minutes ago synced over iCloud to the MacBook soon thereafter).\nI don’t know why this worked or if it will work for others but worth trying!\n\nA: None of the above advice worked for me. Here's what did:\n\n*\n\n*Shut off iCloud Keychain in Settings (untick the box).\n\n*Open KeychainAccess.app.\n\n*Open preferences with <cmd+,> keys.\n\n*Click Reset My Default Keychains You will lose your local keychain data stored on your computer. But if you're trying to sync with iCloud, the iCloud Keychain is the one you ultimately want.\n\n*Sign out and sign back in, go to settings, turn on iCloud Keychain (tick the box). Give it a minute to update.\n\n*Logout and log back in one more time.\n\nI had to play around with this several times. But I think what happens is the forced refresh needs a new login keychain in ~\\Library\\Keychain\nNOTE: Don't touch the encrypted (?) folder with a bunch of random letters. But I did delete the .db files several times while testing. Now my keychain access works!\n", "Q: Can't connect bluetooth headset to mac mini I just bought sony ch500 wireless bluetooth headset and I can't pair it with my mac mini. I was able to pair it with my android phone though. What could be the problem? The bluetooth menu doesn't show my headset.\n\nA: There’s not much you can do but restart and remove any 2.4 ghz interference sources. \niOS has some tips like making sure the device is reset. If it’s paired with your android, it might not broadcast it’s looking to pair with your Mac. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201205\n\nA: I turned out that because I paired it with my phone, it was not in the pairing mode anymore. So, I held the power button for 10 seconds or so and it went into the pairing mode again and I was able to see it in my bluetooth menu.\n", "Q: use Windows registry in wine I want to use Putty on Mac, and I need to import Putty (SSH client) profiles in it.\nPutty profiles are stored in the Windows registry (you can dump and import .reg files on another windows machine without any problem)..is there a way to import them using Wine? \n\nA: Wine emulates the registry so this might be more about putty being amenable to this alternate SDK. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.winehq.org/Regedit\n\n*https://wiki.winehq.org/Winelib\nwine regedit\nIf the second link saying putty is ported is wrong, hopefully you don’t have to dump the registry and translate them to a terminal setup. ssh (as are the other tools) is native on macOS, so functionally you could ditch putty. You’d lose the graphical accordances and specific shortcuts and settings portability of course, which is what I’m guessing you want to avoid reimplementing. \n", "Q: Horizontal flip animation in Keynote I want to perform a horizontal flip animation between two images in Keynote. How I can do this? The flipping should swipe images\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Insert the two images (other object or group to be transitioned).\n\n*Select the first side and from the animation inspector add a Build Out effect of Flip. Disable Bounce.\n\n\n*Select the second side and from the animation inspector add a Build In effect of Flip. Disable Bounce.\n\n*Choose Build Order and set the second build (the build in) to Start: With Build 1.\n\n\n*Set the second side to be in front of the first side by right-clicking on the second side and choosing Bring to Front. Position the two sides on top of each other.\n\n", "Q: Why won't transferred video files get detected in PlayerXtreme iPad app? I just bought an iPad. I have been Windows and Android user all my life. \nIn Android I could just transfer a video file to the device and any video player such as VLC or MXPlayer would automatically detect it.\nI transferred a few video files to my iPad from my Windows PC using iTunes software's file sharing option. I installed PlayerXtreme on my iPad but I can't find any video files in it.\nHow do I make it work?\n\nA: File transfer doesn't work in iOS like other desktop and mobile platforms. In fact, generally speaking, iOS doesn't treat filesystem as a user accessible entity separate from the installed apps (which is a norm in almost all platforms, even macOS).\nThe user experience in iOS is focused on apps which are responsible for managing their own data. Inter-app data sharing is done using a concept called extensions.\nEach app generally manage it's own data in it's own segregated/sandboxed storage space (which could go up to a maximum of available storage space on device) which is not accessible to other apps. File sharing is a iOS feature using which you can transfer data for an app to and from your computer using iTunes (which is available for macOS and Windows).\nHowever, for File Sharing to work, you'll have to have the app pre-installed on your iOS device before connecting it to your computer. It appears that based on your experience with other platforms, you have assumed File Sharing to work like connected storage device, and transferred the files to a different app which also happens to support File Sharing feature.\nDo note that not all iOS apps support File Sharing. It is available only if some of the app features require it and the developer of the app has programmed it.\nTo remedy your situation, start by installing the app, PlayerXtreme Media Player in your case on the iPad. Once the app is installed, connect your iPad to your computer and launch iTunes. Click on the iPad button shown in the toolbar and then click on File Sharing in the sidebar on the left. All the apps supporting File Sharing are listed under Apps list as shown:\n\nNotice that in the above screenshot, none of the apps listed under Apps list is selected. Now select the desired app (PlayerXtreme in your case) by clicking it. Once you have the app selected, drag and drop the video files from Finder under the area titled PlayerXtreme Documents.\n\nEach app manages its documents separately. If you have accidentally added the videos to a different app, you can't move it between apps directly on iPad. You'll need to delete the videos from the wrong apps documents first and re-add them into the Documents for the desired app (PlayerXtreme in your case). Here, for example, I have added a video and the corresponding subtitle file to VLC app documents:\n\nThe video will be available only in VLC app on my iPad and not in PlayerXtreme app. To make it available in PlayerXtreme app, I'll have to copy the files using iTunes into it's PlayerXtreme's documents. You may wish to delete them from VLC app if you do not wish to watch them using VLC.\nAlso, an important thing to note is that neither iOS or iTunes check if a file type is supported by the app. It lets you transfer any file type into app documents as long as storage space is available on iPad.\nComing from a different platform, you may find this kind of workflow quite cumbersome, but this is by design on iOS and made so keeping user data privacy and security in mind.\n\nA: *\n\n*save a couple videos and photos in the files app on iOS. \n\n*take a couple photos and videos from the camera and save them to the files app\n\n*decide which player you want to play these from the files storage\n\n\nNow, you’ve got a feeling for the sandbox and files structure and can see if your existing videos play natively from within the files app or you want a player that supports your library or you’ll convert your library to a format that’s native. \nI would avoid iTunes or thinking of the iPad as just a storage device. Or just save the files to usb and connect usb to iPad to get started.  The less computer involved initially, the happier your experience will be due to a faster learning curve. \n", "Q: RAM Upgrade for Mid-2010 MacBook So I have a Mid-2010 MacBook and I tried to upgrade the RAM. I put in 2 4GB sticks and it started to beep. I took out one, and it still beeped. When I put in one of the original 1GB sticks and a 4GB stick, it worked. Any help on getting it to 8GB?\nEdit: I figured out only one of the 4GB sticks work in the 1/4 configuration.\n\nA: You should search for info about your mac on Everymac.com. I searched there for your mac and assuming I did it right I found this brief comment.\n\nApple officially supports a maximum of 4 GB of RAM, but third-parties have determined that it actually supports 8 GB of RAM running Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\" and 16 GB of RAM running OS X 10.7.5 \"Lion\" or higher and the latest EFI update.\n\nSounds like it depends on which system you are running. I suggest you go there and see what else you can find or go to OtherWorldComputing or here  which reports they sell upgrade kits for your specific Mac.\n", "Q: Automatic display brightness in iMac behaves wrong and is only semi-automatic I use the automatic display brightness function in the System Preferences and I have noticed that it is doing totally wrong. When I turn the feature off and set the brightness to let‘s say maximum and turn the feature on again, the maximum will be used as the standard lighting. So when I set the maximum in a dark room, it will stay this bright. I tired it with 90 % brightness. When I open my windows to let light into the room, it goes up to 100 % and by closing the windows to a totally dark room it‘s going back to the 90 %. And sometimes when I set it to like 10 %, the iMac doesn‘t even react to my flash light. After a little time of tweaking around it works again.\nI have restarted the iMac a couple of times, but it didn‘t help at all.\nHow can I fix that stupid behavior? My iPhone does fine. It uses the real ambient lighting.\nWhat i did is to cover the sensor, set the brightness to as low as possible and activate automation. Putting the hand away set it to an optimal level.

How much more efficient?\n\nA: It is not possible to give any kind of “always true”, generic answer, as the power consumption behavior is different from app to app, and even depending on the input data in each app.\nIn general the power usage by each app is not at all limited to only CPU usage when taking the display itself out of the question. Other major power usages comes from the GPS, cell radios, WiFi radios, the GPU, etc.\nHowever if the app in split screen is doing the exact same stuff as when it is in full screen, then yes, the power consumption is approximately the same as the sum of the power consumption of each app by itself in full screen (when not taking the display into account).\nIn practice the split screen app is usually doing very slightly less, so the total is often slightly less than the sum. However the difference is negligible.\nAgain - this can vary hugely from app to app.\n", "Q: Check the status of a Finder copy-paste operation from Apple Watch Today I had to leave my Mac, while a copy-pasting operation was in progress with a large number of files. I found myself wanting to know how long the operation had left (and if it had encountered any issues, duplicates etc.). This left me wondering, would there be a way to view this progress on an Apple Watch?\nI'm not entirely sure if this already exists via an app on the App Store (please let me know, if there's one) or if someone has coded a sideload app. Either way, let me know because I'd love to investigate. I understand how the app would encounter issues interacting with the actual macOS, but I wonder if anyone has any insight.\nPerhaps if not for the Apple Watch, but for the iPhone?\n\nA: I doubt such an app exists even for iOS, leave aside watchOS, for watching Finder file operation progress. This is a very specific use case and I am not certain if there are any official APIs that lets you obtain this data in a watchOS or iOS app.\nA simple solution that I can think of is to install a VNC viewer app on your iPhone (many available on the App Store). Configure your Mac for screen sharing. Now using the viewer component on your iPhone/iPad, you can visually see the screen of your Mac and check file operation progress.\nVNC apps are not just viewer and you can also control your Mac from your iPhone, thereby giving you the ability to perform operations on your Mac remotely.\n", "Q: What shortcut does ⌦ symbol in Camunda macOS app indicate and how to invoke it? I am using the Camunda macOS app and I am wondering what does this shortcut mean (right facing delete key)?\n\n\nA: It's hard to say without more context on how/where this appears within the application, but Apple uses this symbol for the (forward) Delete key, e.g. on the Magic Keyboard with Keypad:\n\n\nA: In macOS, this symbol represents forward delete shortcut (to delete characters to right). It can be generated using the fn + delete key combination.\nThe aforementioned shortcuts are helpful on majority of Apple keyboards which lacks a dedicated forward delete key, such as MacBook and Apple Magic keyboard.\nTo reiterate:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌫: Delete Left (like Backspace on Widows/PC)\n\n*⌦: Delete Right (fn + delete on compact keyboards.

I am running macOS Mojave, but the problem has existed ever since I bought the computer.\n\nA: There is no problem. Your computer is working as intended.\nA computer does not “run faster” by using more memory. Memory is only used (allocated) when programs ask for memory. If they don’t ask for it, it’s not used. This is the preferred behavior as it makes your computer run faster and use less power without sacrificing anything really.\nThere’s no “8 GB limit” in Mojave, nor in your MacBook Pro hardware.\nIf you want to simulate  program that is asking for lots of memory, then open the Terminal and run this command:\nperl -E 'my $x = \"abcd1234\" x 500000000; sleep(30);'\n\nIt should allocate lots of memory and hold it for 30 seconds, and then give it back.\nYou should be able to see it in Activity Monitor allocating ~8 GB of RAM. If you want to allocate more/less, then change the number \"500000000\" accordingly.\n", "Q: How to set custom m4a format audio file as alarm tone on iPhone How can a custom audio file (m4a format) be set as my alarm tone on an iPhone?

I would like to keep Keybase data folders backup up to my local computer with some kind of real-time file sync solution.\nEvery time Keybase is opened, any local files sync to Keybase associated folder, and visa versa.\nWhat's the current open source solutions that can achieve that?\nThanks\n\nA: Hello and welcome to the site! \nAssuming you have folders \"A\" and \"B\" there are two ways of thinking about sync.\n1) \"One Way\" sync will sync changes and deletions from folder A to folder B but will basically ignore changes in folder B (and will not sync them back to folder A).\n2) \"Two way\" sync would be if you wanted to be able to modify either folders \"A\" or \"B\" and have those changes reflected in the other folder.\n\"One Way\" sync can be accomplished with rsync (although you may want to install a newer version than the one that ships with macOS, as the default one is very old). I would recommend brew for this.\n\"Two Way\" sync is trickier, and I'm not aware of any open-source tool that will let you create a two way sync of two folders on the same computer.\n(That's another consideration: some tools will only work if folders \"A\" and \"B\" are on different computers. rsync can work with either one.)\nOne question to think about is what you are trying to accomplish by having such a mirrored copy. For example, if you accidentally delete a file in folder \"A\" and it immediately syncs to folder \"B\" and deletes the file there, have you really accomplished anything?\nIf what you are looking to accomplish it to be able to restore an accidentally deleted file, or revert to a previous version of a file that was changed in a way that you want to undo, that's a different scenario than just keeping two folders in sync.\nI'm only vaguely familiar with Keybase, but another question I'd ask is whether such a mirror would be useful if there was some sort of corruption. It might be more useful to have a \"snapshot\" of all of the Keybase files at a particular point in time. Depending on how often its files change, you might be able to use launchd to create a tar.bz2 or tar.gz (or tar.xz if you also install xz with brew) \"snapshot\" of Keybase, and put a time-stamp in the filename, so if you did need to revert some changes, you would know that you had all of the files as they existed at a particular point-in-time.\nAgain, I'm not 100% sure that would work with Keybase, but I have used it with other apps.\nKeyboard Maestro\n\nEvery time Keybase is opened, any local files sync to Keybase associated folder, and visa versa.\n\nIf you want to trigger this every time the Keybase app launches and/or quits, then you should use Keyboard Maestro.\nI'm not aware of any open-source option for that.\n\nA: Personally I use rsync at this time. It's not real-time, but running it every 30 seconds makes it enough for my use case. It's also not good if files are being edited from various servers simultaneously, my use case is mainly creating new files.\nI basically have 5 servers distributing a web service that uses local files so I have to keep a common folder in sync on all servers.\nI do something like this on all 5 servers:\nrsync -rzlvtuog <path> <srvX:path>\n\nThis command is repeated for each of the other 4 nodes in the setup. The important flags are t and u to update timestamps and only copy files having been updated.\nIt doesn't help with deletion but at least all files are in synch regardless of which server they get created on.\n", "Q: Mac thinks USB is the wrong format I have a USB drive that I cleaned and formatted as FAT32 on my Linux machine because Diskutil disableOwnership wouldn't work.  I plugged it into the Windows machine with the files I need and copied them onto the USB with no problems.  But when I plugged the USB into my Mac, it gave the error, \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\"\nI reopened terminal and ran diskutil info.

What is a possible cause?  Is there a way to force MacOS to recognize the disk correctly?\nNote: The reason I formatted the disk with Linux was that I get the error \"Couldn't modify the partition map\" when I use Diskutil to erase the disk.\n\nA: This question has a comment that FAT32 is not best for Mac. Can you format disc as ExFAT? That would be best if you want this to be cross-platform or HFS+ for Mac only.

I looked up under System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items, but couldn't find an entry for the app.\n\nHow can I prevent the app from launching automatically upon system startup?\n\nA: Many apps have a checkbox or a pulldown menu in the preferences panes where you can instruct it to launch on login.  Start your app and under the first menu item select preferences (NOT system preferences under the Apple menu item). Look thru all the preferences panels and one should have a designator switch to launch at login.\n\nA: There are quite a few ways that programs persist themselves, especially if they don't want you to see them or stop them.\nThe best tool to list these and guide you visually is a free to use tool called Knock Knock and it lets you know who might come knocking next time you start up your Mac.

The shortcut is Control + Alt + Command + C.\nIt has always worked, but today it suddenly stopped working. I tried sniffing for any program that activates when the shortcut is pressed using /usr/bin/sudo opensnoop in Terminal but to no success. I have not recently installed any new programs and I can't recall anything particular happening that could be the culprit.\nHow do I get my shortcut back?\nMy Automator workflow looks like this (the actions are in Swedish):\n\n\nA: This is an extended comment containing some suggestions of things to try and help you diagnose your problem, but I don't claim that any of these will definitely solve your issue:\nCheck defaults to look for clashing keyboard shortcuts\nYour service runs with a different shortcut and inside Automator.  So there is possibly a conflicting shortcut that has appeared and is blocking your original.\nIn Terminal (or other terminal emulator), you can retrieve all the active app-specific keyboard shortcuts:\ndefaults find NSUserKeyEquivalents\n\nand your service workflow shortcuts:\ndefaults find NSServicesStatus \n\nThe symbols used to represent modifier keys are:\n\n*\n\n*@: ⌘ command\n\n*$: ⇧ shift\n\n*~: ⌥ alt/option\n\n*^: ⌃ ctrl\nThus, ⌘+⌥+⌃+C is symbolised as @~^c (the c is lowercase).\nYou can do a general defaults search through all the preference files to look for that specific combination of characters:\ndefaults find '@~^c'\n\nYou can also search for matching preferences files:\ngrep -iE '@~\\^c' ~/Library/Preferences/* /Library/Preferences/* 2>/dev/null\n\nwhich, upon matching, will output something like:\nBinary file /Users/CK/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services.plist matches\n\nand then you can target the specific domain to examine its defaults:\ndefaults read com.apple.ServicesMenu.Services\n\nThird-party Application\nThere are third-party apps that allow you to see what keyboard shortcuts are being used by which applications on your system.  The one I know of is KeyCue:\n(source: ergonis.com)\n(source: ergonis.com)\nI'm not endorsing the product and have never used it myself, but I believe it would be very useful in finding out if there's interference from another application or from within Finder stopping you from using that shortcut combination.\nIt's a paid app (€19.99), but has a free evaluation period:\n\nAll our products are available for evaluation before purchase. As long as you do not have a license key, KeyCue operates in trial mode and occasionally displays a registration reminder instead of the shortcut table.\n\n\nADDENDUM : Your Workflow\nThanks for posting a screenshot of your workflow.  There doesn't appear to be anything obstructive about it that would obviously cause it to stop responding to a shortcut.\nHowever, I'm going to take the opportunity to suggest some edits to it, as I can see what your AppleScript is doing, but it's not doing it in the most optimal way.\nHere is your current workflow:\n\nIt starts by taking the files/folders passed to the service/quick action and copying them to the clipboard.  There's no need to and it only makes Automator do more work than it has to.  Instead, you can delete that first action, and have the files/folders pass directly into the AppleScript, where they will be stored in the variable input.\nThe AppleScript itself makes use of application \"BBEdit\" unnecessarily, so I suggest removing that and I'll show you how to make the changes you need without calling out to it.\nIf I'm interpreting your goal correctly from what you said and from what I see in your workflow, you wish to select some files or folders, press your shortcut key combination, and have file URL references to those files/folders copied to the clipboard, e.g. file:///Users/CK/Desktop/somefile.txt.\nYour method works ok in some situations, but will produce incorrect results in a few other situations:\n\n*\n\n*Any file/folder with a space in its name will not return a correct and clickable file URL link.  For example, the file with path /Users/CK/Shared Items/myfile.ext will be copied to the clipboard as file:///Users/CK/Shared Items/myfile.ext, which is an incorrectly encoded URL string, thus the hyperlink will appear like this: file:///Users/CK/Shared Items/myfile.ext.  (Technically, other character entities need to be percent encoded to form a valid URL, but I think they're less important if you're just looking to use them locally in Finder.)\n\n\n*Your present method replaces occurrences of \"/Volumes\" and occurrences of \"/Users\" with \"file:///Volumes\" and \"file:///Users\", respectively.  This will cause problems for any file path that might look something like this:\n/Users/CK/Backup/Preferences/Volumesettings/Volumes.dat\n\nThere are three replacements waiting to happen there, which would yield:\n    file:///Users/CK/Backup/Preferencesfile:///Volumesettingsfile:///Volumes.dat\n\nHaving cleaned up the script, and deleted the superfluous action, here is what I am suggesting would be a smarter way to implement your service/quick action:\n\nThe AppleScript:\nproperty text item delimiters : linefeed\n\n\non run {FSItems}\n    local FSItems\n    \n    tell application \"System Events\" to repeat with FSItem in FSItems\n        set FSItem's contents to the URL of FSItem\n    end repeat\n    \n    set the clipboard to FSItems as text\nend run\n\nIt utilises System Events (which is a faceless, background application that can perform efficient file system operations) to take each file/folder passed into the workflow and obtain an AppleScript property named URL, which conveniently holds the perfectly-formatted, validated file URL reference for a file.  Once it has a list of file URLs, it combines them into a single piece of text—one file URL per line—and places that on the clipboard.\nThus, selecting the following files/folder in Finder (if you imagine I selected three files and a folder, then pressed the hotkey to trigger the service):\n\n/Users/CK/Desktop/NSImage.png\n/Users/CK/Desktop/GIF Images\n/Volumes/Lepton 1.5.2-alpha-2\n/Users/CK/Desktop/mandelbrot.js\n\nwould yield the following clipboard contents (this is a live test):\nfile:///Users/CK/Desktop/NSImage.png\nfile:///Users/CK/Desktop/GIF%20Images/\nfile:///Volumes/Lepton%201.5.2-alpha-2/\nfile:///Users/CK/Desktop/mandelbrot.js\n\n", "Q: Sync Apple Maps Favorites across personal devices I have a MacBook (running macOS Mojave 10.14.5) and an iPhone (running iOS 12.3.1). I want to share my Favorites in Maps app between both the devices.

If you are logged in with same iCloud ID on both of your devices and have iCloud sync enabled, favorite created on one device automatically syncs on the other.\nTo verify if the settings are configured correctly, on your Mac, go to System Preferences → iCloud → iCloud Drive (Options...) and verify that Maps is checked:\n\nOn your iPhone, go to Settings app → Your Name → iCloud and check that Maps is enabled under Apps Using iCloud section:\n\n\nIf the above two verifies, you are all set.

My iPhone almost always replaces the word make (lower-case) with the word Male (yes, with a capital M). I don't get auto-correct suggestion in a bubble. The change happens automatically immediately after I press the Space key after typing make.\nI think this has been going on about 3-4 months. I’m wondering if I’m losing my mind. Almost every time I type the word make (including just there; I am typing this on my phone) it just magically changes to Male, and I have to select the word and manually retype it.\nI‘ve checked in Settings app → General → Keyboard → Text Replacement, and there’s no such replacement defined.\nSo it seems my iPhone has just learned to do this, but I can’t think of any time I would have made this substitution myself.\nQuestion: How can I fix this (without globally disabling auto-correction)?\nBonus points for curiosity: Why has my iPhone started doing this? I can’t see how it could learn to replace a very common word with a much less common word (with nonstandard capitalisation, at that). Seems like some kind of broken machine learning algorithm stuck in a weird self-affirming loop. But if so, why would this bug only manifest in a single persistent unwanted substitution? (My iPhone does seem to have reluctantly accepted that I rarely meant to type ducking, so clearly it can learn.)\n\nA: If iOS is persistent in making this correction, make a text replacement:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-text-replacements-iph6d01d862/ios\nPut the correct text as both the replacement and the shortcut.\n\nA: Open any app (Notes, Messages) with a text field and type the word make normally. Now when iPhone auto-correction subsystem offers a correction, simply tap on the ｘ button show besides the correction.\n\nNow quit the app completely from multitasking UI and repeat this 4-5 times, until your iPhone stops suggesting the auto-correction to Male.\nThis way you have effectively made it learn that you do not want make to be changed to Male.\n", "Q: Prevent Mail pop up automatically when there's a new email I'm using macOS Mojave.

I need about 6-10.   \nAlso they seem to be attached to some grey rubber too.  Is this important?   \nWhat do I need to consider if I want to buy replacements?\n\nA: I assume you are talking about the first generation MacPro \"CheeseGrater\" tower. for future reference it is best to include the model number with your question so there is no confusion.\nThe screws are actually standard threads and common to ANY hard drive. You should be able to get these screws at any hardware store worth its name. Just take the HD with you to make sure you get the right ones. \nThe rubber grommets can also be sourced at a hardware or electrical parts store. Just get some grommets that will fit in the holes in the Apple HD trays and then size the screws long enough to span the gap between the grommet, the HD tray and into the drive. Depending on the size of the screw head you may also need some flat washers.\nI did this with my MacPro 1,1 many years ago and it worked a treat.\nSourcing the Apple genuine parts proved frustrating and the few places/people that carried them wanted way more money than it was worth.

My new MacBook Pro came with a USB C charger and an associated cable. \nI'm noticing this cable is a little bit thicker than other USB C charging cables I've seen. \nWhat safety and charge carrying standards exist with USB C so I can know if a specific thinner / thicker cable is both safe and can support specific charge rates?\n\nA: To answer my own question, according to Wikipedia, USB C cables can have different carrying capacities:\n\nAll USB-C cables must be able to carry a minimum of 3 A current (at 20 V, 60 W) but can also carry high-power 5 A current (at 20 V, 100 W).[10] All USB-C to USB-C cables must contain e-marker chips programmed to identify the cable and its current capabilities. USB Charging ports should also be clearly marked with capable power wattage.[11]\n\nSo while I can't say this with 100% certainty, the cable that comes with the MBP charger probably is a higher capacity cable, but USB-C cables have chips in them to tell the device and charger their carrying capacity.\n\nA: The fact that the cable is thick does not necessarily lead to it's ability to reliably deliver a higher wattage. A thinner cable will deliver as much power as long it's a good quality cable that adheres to USB-C standard. USB-C is a standard, but that doesn't mean that all cables you can buy adhere to it. You could buy a thick cable that is poorly made and it could be a hazard.\nThe thickness of the cable doesn't really matter. It's the quality of the cable and how well it adheres to USB-C standard. When buying USB-C cables, buy from a reputable brand and for more than $.99\n\nA: If you look at macOS's System Report in the Power section it will tell you the current wattage of the plugged in adapter.\nAC Charger Information:\n  Connected:    Yes\n  ID:   0x0000\n  Wattage (W):  96\n  Family:   0xe000400a\n  Charging: Yes\n\nI tested this with my Pixel 5 USB-C cable, which is about the same thickness as the native MacBook Pro cable and got only 60 watts.\nWhen I tested it with the USB-C cable that came with my iPad Pro, which is about the same thickness as a standard Apple-provided lightning cable, it reported 96 watts.\nSo, like @clbx mentioned, it's definitely not the size that matters.\n", "Q: In iMovie, can I suppress the visual portion of a video clip?

There is, as far as I'm aware, no way to prevent this - all you can do is try to delete them right before ejecting the disk.\nThere's a bash script on Superuser - How do I keep Mac OS X from saving hidden files on my flash drive?\n which would appear to do this, though idk how many times you are going to have to authorise the sudo command; hopefully once per session not once per disk.\nPersonally, I invested in the paid alternative, BlueHarvest, which does the same thing in a 'set & forget' manner & is customisable for different drive types & purposes.. \n\nBuilt-in support for deleting: .DS_Store, ._AppleDouble, .apdisk, .AppleDouble (folders via smb), .com.apple.timemachine.donotpresent, .fseventsd, .Spotlight-V100, .TemporaryItems, .VolumeIcon.icns, $Recycle.bin, Desktop.ini, Icon?, Thumbs.db\n\n\nA: Well, you could consider writing a bash script and use mdutil with the -d, -i, -X options.\nUsage: mdutil -pEsa -i (on|off) -d volume ...\n       mdutil -t {volume-path | deviceid} fileid\n    Utility to manage Spotlight indexes.\n    -p             Publish metadata.\n    -i (on|off)    Turn indexing on or off.\n    -d             Disable Spotlight activity for volume (re-enable using -i on).\n    -E             Erase and rebuild index.\n    -s             Print indexing status.\n    -t             Resolve files from file id with an optional volume path or device id.\n    -a             Apply command to all volumes.\n    -V vol         Apply command to all stores on the specified volume.\n    -v             Display verbose information.\n    -r plugins     Ask the server to reimport files for UTIs claimed by the listed plugin.\n    -L path        List the directory contents of the Spotlight index on the specified volume.\n    -P path        Dump the VolumeConfig.plist for the specified volume.\n    -X path        Remove the Spotlight index directory on the specified volume.  Does NOT disable indexing.\nNOTE: Run as owner for network homes, otherwise run as root.\n\n\nA: I think the best method would be to create an image of the contents then use an imaging tool to copy that to each SD card. Etcher is the tool I use to write the image to the SD card, but it can also be done from the command line.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial on how to do the entire process from the command line. https://appcodelabs.com/how-to-backup-clone-a-raspberry-pi-sd-card-on-macos-the-easy-way\n", "Q: How do I get Mail.app use a template? It would be very convenient in macOS mail if upon clicking Reply, a simple template would:\n\n\n*\n\n*insert a \"Hi [first name of recipient from original email],\"\n\n*add my signature\n\n*quote the original email at the very end (as usual)\n\n\nAny mail.app extensions (plugins) that do this one simple feature?\n\nA: The Mail.app is scriptable, although AppleScript can be a little weird to work with. It wouldn't be hitting the reply button, but you can put a command in the Menu Bar under a Script Menu.\nMuch of the following comes from a discussions.apple.com thread (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4401380):\nOpen the Script Editor (in Utilities) and go into its preferences and check \"Show Script menu in menu bar\"\nThen create a new script with something like this:\nset myReply to \"Thanks, I've received your email. If I have any questions about it I will contact you directly\"\n\ntell application \"Mail\"\n    set theSelection to selection\n    if theSelection is {} then return\n    activate\n    repeat with thisMessage in theSelection\n        set theOutgoingMessage to reply thisMessage with opening window\n        repeat until exists (window 1 whose name = \"Re: \" & subject of thisMessage)\n        end repeat\n        delay 0.1\n\n        -- send gui scripting to handler to get it out of Mail tell block\n        my guiScriptMail(myReply)\n        send theOutgoingMessage -- This automatically sends the message!\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\non guiScriptMail(myReply)\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Mail\"\n            set frontmost to true\n            -- keystroke \"a\" using {command down} -- ⌘A to select all\n            keystroke myReply\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend guiScriptMail\n\nThen save this script to the Desktop. In the Script menu, go to \"Open Scripts Folder\" and select \"Open User Scripts Folder\". In the folder that open up (should be ~/Library/Scripts) create a folder named \"Mail\" - this will create a context sensitive menu in the Scripts menu, so that it will only show your script if you are in the Mail application.\nThen you can select a message in Mail, and then select the script in the Script menu and your reply should be filled out and sent.\nAgain, AppleScript can be a little tricky and can fail or hang sometimes, but works well most of the time.\n\nA: Unfortunately I don't know of any good way to do this within Apple Mail. There are a few close-ish things, but none are really solutions.\nAutomator Services\nAutomator contains the ability to create services—\"contextual workflows\" that can be run on specific items to process them. However, since it has no particular input format for emails, you'll likely be relegated to selecting the address or something of the sort, separately running the service, then using the output in your email. At that point, you're probably better off not using it.\n\nMail Stationary\nMail Stationary is, well, stationary. It's a template. However, their use is heavily restricted. First, they aren't context aware: unlike Pages templates, they have no ability to pull outside information and insert it. Instead, you've got to do all the work. Second, they don't work for replies, only new messages.\n\nOther services\nOutlook supports replies with specific templates via their more powerful Rules (which can be extended with third party extensions), unlike Apple Mail's rules (which can only be configured as basically an autoreply.) Gmail supports canned responses, albeit in a more limited format, as it exists outside the rules system.\n", "Q: Prevent external speakers in monitors connected via HDMI being used I sometimes run into an issue where I connect an external monitor via HDMI, and my Macbook Pro's sound is now routed to the monitor instead of my headphones or the internal speakers. Worse, sometimes this means that the volume control buttons stop working (even mute!)\nI never, ever, want sound going through an external monitor. The internal speakers are better than most monitor speakers, anyway.\nIs there a way to prevent this happening?\n\nA: In the sound section of system preferences, make sure that \"Internal Speakers\" is selected.\n\n\nA: I made an app for this.

However if you disable notes to backup, Apple documents that they delete your copies in the cloud when you elect to not back up that data so even if you mistakenly allow that, you should have reasonable control over your data retentionand know what to expect.\n\n\nA: I routinely take notes with Concepts app while offline, and as there's neither built in OCR nor forced-synching of anything, my notes are private and secure. \nAlso worth noting both Apple notes w/out synch and also Pages with a password lock per file can be considered pretty secure.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 recognizing my External lavalier mic as an headphone not microphone My iPhone 6 is recognizing my external microphone plugged into the headphone jack as an headphone rather than a microphone, resulting in no audio output from iPhone speakers.\nHow do I make my iPhone 6 recognize that my external mic is a microphone rather than a headphone? \nLavaliere Mic https://amzn.to/2KDW73w\n\nMy Mic uses TRRS on the main cable and a TRS on the adapter. Mic can be used on both Iphone and Laptops\n\nA: It would be helpful for you to include the make and model of the mic that you are using, as anything we say will be nothing more than a guess.\nThat said, if you compare a pair of generic earbuds with Apple's earbuds you will find that there are more \"rings\" around the shaft of the Apple earbuds than the generic ones you get elsewhere.\nOne of the \"extra\" rings is for the mic. And to match up with the iPhone the microphone \"ring\" needs to be in the exact same place the iPhone's jack expects it.\nWhich leads me to what I think might be your problem:\nUnless your mic specifically says \"iPhone compatible\" it is likely that the plug on the end of your mic does not have the connectors in the right place for the phone to recognize your mic as a microphone.\nAnd when you get down to it a microphone can be thought of as a specialized speaker, which it is. Hence the reason you can play sound out of it now.\nSo what do you do about this?\nThere are options. You could return it and get a mic that specifically says it works with an iPhone. You could contact the manufacturer and see if they have an adapter that would do the same thing with your current mic.\nAlso if it IS specifically compatible with your iPhone then it is not working and should be returned for replacement, if possible.\nIf you edit your original question and add the make and model of the microphone we might have better guesses.\n", "Q: Move folders using Terminal by referencing a CSV file I have a CSV file containing the following two columns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Column A: From Directory (e.g. /Volumes/Backup Plus/Salesforce/Order Test/OR-1000049439).\n\n*Column B: To Directory (e.g. /Volumes/Backup Plus/Salesforce/Opportunity Test/Q-DNYE20180508-2308).\nI need to write a script in Terminal that will loop through the CSV and move the directory from Column A into the directory from column B.

Below is an approach using the Go language. I expect others will soon be along with alternative tools and languages.\nIf this is a one-time task, expect to spend time handholding the process. \nIf this going to become a regular automated task, spend time now to get the script or tool right.\nThings to be aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Appreciate that the csv file format is not fully standardized.\n\n*Know that Excel has a reputation with the csv format.\n\n*Does any file or folder name contain a quote, space, or comma?\n\n*What happens if folders are listed but missing on disk?\n\n*What happens if a folder for moving is listed twice?\n\n*What happens if a folder for moving already exists at the destination?\n\n\n\nBack-up your data before running any answers.\n\ncsv-move\nThe csv-move tool requires UNIX/LF line endings. Converting the line endings is a problem solved elsewhere.\nReady to use binaries of csv-move are available in the latest release. Below is an extract of the code:\n// Read from stdin - expects LF line endings\nr := csv.NewReader(os.Stdin)\nr.FieldsPerRecord = 2\n\nfor {\n    line, err := r.Read()\n    // ...\n\n    // Perform the command\n    cmd := exec.Command(mvPath, \"-vn\", line[0], line[1])\n    if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"move failed: %s\", err.Error())\n    }\n}\n\nTest your CSV file can be parsed as two entries per line:\n./csv-move < input.csv\n\nOnce tested, and you are happy with the printed move commands, perform the move:\n./csv-move -move < input.csv\n\n\nA: On shell level\nwhile IFS=\\, read -t $'\\r' s t; do\n    echo mv -n \"$s\" \"$t/\"\ndone < orderfile.csv\n\nRemove the echo once you are sure the result looks ok. \nAs a small safeguard against errors I would recommend to limit a CSV to about 1000 lines.\n\nA: You should expect that any csv file will need to be sanitized before using it in the shell environment. At minimum, the header, if it exists, should be removed, all line terminating characters will need to be converted to LF (the linefeed character), and the last line of the csv file will need to be terminated.\nThe file command shows that your csv file has CR (carriage return) terminated lines. So, using simple available commands, you can convert the CR characters to LF characters with tr then pipe the results to sed to remove the header and terminate the last line, creating a new sanitized file.\ntr '\\r' '\\n' < OrderFileV2.csv | sed '1d;a\\' >sanitizedOrderFileV2.csv\n\nThe new file should be checked for contiguous rows. Empty fields and lines should be removed. You now should have a file that you can feed into a while read loop.\n", "Q: Do battery strips prevent an iPhone's power from cutting out? I have an iPhone SE. I wanted to get a new battery. I made the mistake of taking it to a non-Apple vendor. They broke my iPhone and I wonder what role the battery strips (missing from my iPhone) play. \nThe phone starts and I can log in. Everything is fine until the phone suddenly cuts out and goes dead. This happens both when charging and not charging. It doesn't shut down, just cuts out.\nThe shop staff told me it's a software issue. I just don't believe them as I don't see any process happening when it cuts and the state of the phone when it's back up is different from when it gets cut out.\nThe shop staff also lied to me about what was and wasn't in my phone when they returned it. Apple told me the battery strips were missing and the device should be replaced (I took it to Apple after the other vendor broke the phone).\nSo now I'm wondering what the significance and purpose of battery strips is? And, whether or not getting new strips might fix my phone?\nEdit: \nI forgot to mention that I requested my original battery be put back in. So this cutting out problem happened with the replacement battery as well as with the original battery after their tampering. \n\nA: Battery strips are adhesive, stretchy \"tape\" strips. The purpose of them is to keep the battery in place, as well as slightly insulate the battery from the casing. The insulation means that sudden applications of heat or cold to the outside case (such as for example taking the phone out in intense sun light, or placing it on a very cold surface) doesn't immediately transfer the heat/cold to the battery via the aluminium casing.\nIf you're not exposing the phone to these changes in heat/cold when the cutout happens, it just sounds like you've received a non-Apple battery replacement of low quality.\nUsually these cuts outs happen when the phone hardware uses more power than the battery can provide. As the power draw increases, the current (i.e. volts) are lowered slightly. With a bad battery, a normal power usage can lower the current so significantly that it is below the requirements of the CPU. This means that the system just shuts off immediately.\nIt is obviously not healthy for a phone.\nI see it as very unlikely that new battery strips will solve your problem, unless you specifically see the problem when shaking the phone, or exposing it to heat/cold. Your problem could potentially be solved by replacing the battery - but then you'll also want battery strips installed ofcourse.\n", "Q: How to purchase apps through my personal AppleId and charge my employer?

(I will be without internet nearly all the trip.)\nI'd be equally happy keeping all my iCloud Drive contents on my iPad, but there doesn't seem to be a \"Keep All Files\" vs. \"Optimize Storage\" option on iOS.\n\nA: While iOS/iPadOS 15 still does not offer a native feature, there is a workaround using \"Shortcuts\" that will trigger the files to download.\n\n*\n\n*Open the Shortcuts app and create a new shortcut\n\n*Add Action \"Get Contents of Folder\" (*)\n\n*Press the triangle icon and enable \"Recursive\"\n\n*Add Action \"Get Details of Files\"\n\n*Set the detail variable to \"File Size\" (if not set by default)\n\n(*) You can set the \"Folder\" variable to a single folder in your cloud, the entire iCloud or just leave it as a variable (in which case you'll get asked every time you run the shortcut).\nAs with any shortcut you can run this action from the Shortcuts app, put it on your home screen (using the share icon at the bottom) or create an automation to automatically run it by schedule or under certain circumstances.\n\n\nA: One hack I’ve found, that will work one time only (it won’t keep the folder updated offline constantly like you want) - so you’ll need to do this just before you leave for the vacation / beach (places that Apple doesn’t seem to think exist, which is why they don’t have this stupidly simple feature on the Files app):\nLong-press a folder on your iPad in Files and hit Compress.

Example: quickbooks multi user, multiple accounts: we can both be working in quickbooks in different accounts and they sync together. Hope i am make sense. Thanks\n\nA: Each application needs to be designed for sharing.  You need to check on each application's ability to share. \nRobert\n\nA: Two things to research when you purchase apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Are you licensed to run two copies on two different Macs a the same time. Generally OK for home use and not for business use. App Store licensing means if you get the App from Apple's store, you know the terms clearly. If not - you'll need to know how the vendor work it.\n\n*Just save the working files to a server or set up sync. For some things, like collaborating on a spreadsheet - you can use iCloud / Google Docs / OneDrive / box.com / SmartSheet / etc... - for others, there is no sharing - the file gets locked and you'll have to move things after.\n\n\nIt's really up to the implementation on how a document is saved whether your workflow will be possible or need a lot of workarounds / hacks or just fail. Quickbooks probably has both a sync and online version, but check with them to be sure or wait for someone who uses it - they might have an awesome answer, but I wanted to answer in general.\n", "Q: Neither dock or bar appears on external monitor when I move an app to it How can I fix it?

This is true of both HFS+ installations of macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and earlier, as well as APFS installation of macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and later.\nThe use of a case-insensitive file systems means that files and folders can be reached with any mix of case in the name. The name used to create the file/folder is used verbatim when displaying the name of the file, but when you need to access it, you can mix it up:\n$ touch myTeSt\n$ ls\nmyTeSt\n$ rm mytest\n$ \n\nI.e. the case is displayed as \"myTeSt\" when running ls, but you can delete the file using \"mytest\", \"MYTEST\" or any variation thereof.\nNaturally, this also extends to programs that you can then start using any variation of case inside the program name.\nNote that it is possible to install macOS on a case-sensitive file system, where this does not apply, however it is not the default install.\n", "Q: iPhone ceased connecting to AkrutoSync on laptop with static IP address I seem to be having problems sync'ing my iPhone with Outlook on the laptop via AkrutoSync.  It is configured to sync over home WiFi, not over the Internet.  The IPv4 address of the laptop is static, fixed at 192.168.1.101, and this has worked for quite a few months.  The only things that are configured to sync are Calendar, Contacts, and Notes (not email).  The last sync was on Fri July 21.\nI tried a number of things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting the AkrutoSync log file, which tends to get very large\n\n*Removing very old calendar itmes and large attachments to them\n\n*Compacting and restarting Outlook\n\n*Rebooting laptop, home WiFi router, and the iPhone\n\n*I followed the AkrutoSync process to reconfigure the Exchange account, but the phone timed out before 192.168.1.101 responded (AkrutoSync was waiting for the phone to connect)\n\n*I even updated Java (though I don't know if that's relevant)\nHere are the details of my accessories/apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*AkrutoSync 5.2.33 (32-bit)\n\n*Laptop: Toshiba Satellite A110 running Windows 7 Pro, 64-bit\n\n*Outlook version 2007\n\n*iPhone SE running iOS 12.3.1\n\n*Laptop firewall: Whatever comes with Windows 7 (if any)\n\n*WiFi router TP-Link model TD-W9970\n\n*Both the iPhone and laptop are able to access the internet\n\n\nWhat else can I do?\nThanks.\n\nA: Thanks to AkrutoSync, the problem is solved.  The WiFi was off, so internet connectivity was due to the use of my data plan.  The iPhone often flips settings in ways that I don't expect, e.g., switching out of low-power mode.  It's still possible that I had disabled WiFi, but at the moment, I am unable to think of a situation in which I would specifically choose to ensure that the data plan is used instead of WiFi.\nAfternote: Actually, one reason to ensure use of data plan rather than WiFi was to ensure uninterrupted connectivity as one moves around, e.g., when using Google Maps for navigation.  It was possible that navigation would be uninterrupted by the hand-off from WiFi to data plan, but as I was in a hurry, I didn't want to risk it.\n", "Q: How Do I Know When I am in Private Mode?

We have a rogue wireless access point broadcasting our SSID that's not connected to the network.  Occasionally, the Macs in the area will attach to this AP and will then have no network access.\nI have identified the MAC address of this WAP/device.\nIs there a way to blacklist the MAC address of this specific AP so that the Mac workstations/laptops don't try to use for network access?\n(Fair warning, I'm a Windows guy, so please provide instructions a 5-year old can understand :-) )\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Unfortunately macOS does not provide a way to blacklist a specific access point. On some other operating system you can do this via the BSSID (basic service set identifier) of the access point. \nYou were referring to a MAC, but it is not really a MAC - but rather a BSSID. The BSSID is usually derived from the actual MAC of the access point though, but it is not the same.\nI would look at two ways to solve the problem:\nThe first would be to try and find the rogue access point by connecting to your Macs remotely and issuing the following command:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s\n\nThis command gives you a list of the access points in range - including the BSSID. If you automate this command to be run on all computers, you should be able to narrow down which computers can detect that access point, and with which signal strength. Hopefully this will allow you to find the rogue access point.\nThe second way to try and solve the problem is to work the other way around - namely by specifying which access point your desktops connect to. I.e. do not block a specific access point, but instead specify which to connect to (a kind of white list).\nYou can connect to a specific access point using this command:\n/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport --associate=<SSID> --bssid=<BSSID>\n\nYou must replace \"\" and \"\" with their corresponding values.\nIf you have multiple access points of your own, you'll need to create a small scirpt to select the known-good BSSID with the best signal strength obtained from running the previously mentioned command.\nThere's also a third party utility that supposedly makes it easier to associate to a specific access point:\nhttps://github.com/qpSHiNqp/airport-bssid\nHowever it seems it hasn't been updated since 2016, so it might be out of date.\nIt is used like this:\nairport-bssid <interface> <bssid> <password>\n\nwhere you need to replace ,  and  accordingly. Interface could be for example \"en1\".\n", "Q: Profile installation can't authenticate to the MDM server I'm using Meraki Systems Manager as a solution for mobile device management, and lately I've been getting this error message from System Preferences(Profiles) when trying to enroll a new macOS device into the system.\n\nProfile installation failed.\n  Could not authenticate to the MDM server. The credentials within the enrollment profile may have expired.\n\nThis workflow was working fine for me as recently as a couple weeks ago, which is the last time I enrolled a device. What steps can I take to troubleshoot this or verify the error message?\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I confirm (or refute) that the credentials within the profile are expired?\n\n*Is there some place I can find additional log entries with more details about the failure?\n\n*Is there any other way to test authentication to the MDM server, other than repeatedly trying to install the same profile?\n\n\nFor what it's worth, this laptop is running macOS Mojave 10.14.5.\n\nA: After a few round trips with Cisco support, it turned out the problem was specific to one particular laptop that had recently been repaired at the Apple Store.\nThe laptop had been joined to Meraki MDM prior to going in for repair. The main logic board was replaced at the Apple Store, and although the serial number stayed the same it must have changed some other hardware identifier. After coming back from repair, the laptop was reformatted but was unable to join Meraki MDM.\nThe solution was to Delete (Remove From Network) the laptop from the list of Devices in Meraki Systems Manager. After that, I had no trouble re-joining the laptop into Meraki MDM. This was a surprise, because normally it's not necessary to delete device entries, as they automatically merge based on serial number.\n", "Q: How to quit multiple application on mac using an automator app? I made an application on Automator (app x) that launches few applications (app a,b,c). I was wondering instead of creating another application to quit the apps(app a,b,c), is there a way I can get Automator to quit those apps when I quit app x?\nnote: when I launch app x it doesn't have the dot underneath it that indicates an application is active.\n\nA: An Automator app doesn't usually stay open after its run if all it's doing is opening a few apps. That said, since you want to open and close the same apps with a single app that stays open and then closes the target apps when you quit the app that opened them, I would choose to do this with a stay open AppleScript application.\nThe following example AppleScript code, shown below, will open the three apps in the theseApps list and then close them when you close the app made from this code.\nIn Script Editor, copy an paste the example AppleScript into a new untitled document.\nproperty theseApps : {\"Contacts\", \"Dictionary\", \"Notes\"}\n\non run\n    repeat with thisApp in theseApps\n        activate application thisApp\n    end repeat\nend run\non quit\n    repeat with thisApp in theseApps\n        quit application thisApp\n    end repeat\n    continue quit\nend quit\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Obviously, change the names of the app in the example AppleScript code to meet your needs.\n\n\nNow save the script as an AppleScript application while checking the Stay open after run handler check box.\nThe example AppleScript code, shown above and as is, when saved as a stay open AppleScript application, worked for me without issue on macOS High Sierra.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\n\nA: An easy way to do this is with \nKeyboard Maestro\nwhich can run commands to open apps together or quit a group \nof apps when a particular app quits.\nAll you'd need to do is specify the app that you want to monitor when it quits, and then tell it to quit the other apps as well.\n", "Q: Adding Test Credit Card to Apple Pay I'm trying to add a test credit card in my Applet Wallet (with icloud and app store signed in to my developer account). \nI found a list of test credit cards available from Apple's page https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/\nHowever, most of these cards (tried about 10-15 randomly selected ones), threw either invalid card or unsupported errors.\nHas anyone encountered the same issue?\n\nA: The first thing I would do is set my region to one of the supported ones for test and make sure I remove all payment from wallet and settings. \nThen create a new sandbox account. The common item is mixing the production stream with sandbox stream and burning your account status in the sandbox. \n\nImportant: If you mistakenly use a sandbox tester account to sign in to a production environment, like iTunes, on your test device instead of your test environment, the sandbox account becomes invalid and can’t be used again. If this happens, create a new sandbox tester account with a new email address.\n\nIt’s unlikely your developer account would be valid on device when testing payments in a sandbox with sandbox banking details. \n", "Q: new Xcode + GitHub A new Mac laptop with OSX 10.13 with Xcode 9 on it gets run time errors from a cloned the project that runs fine 10.8 OSX and Xcode 5\nThe C++ project throws Run-Time-Exception against one of the dylib's that are part of my project saying they can not be found in /usr/local/lib.\nBelow is the image trying to run the program on the new machine under new Xcode:\n\nBelow is a screenshot of trying to run the program from the Terminal:\n\nThose are instructions I followed to create the original project on the old machine.\nHow do I fix this runtime?\n\nA: The first place to start would be checking the health and presence of the file in the dyld error:\n/usr/local/lib/liblibdbwindow.dyld\n\nOr fix the linking errors by changing what libraries the project expects.\n", "Q: Mojave - How can I lower the lowest volume? Currently I'm at 1/4 volume (option+shift+volume) but it is still loud.\nAll of the systemic solutions are out of date or about limiting maximum volume.\nIs there a way to permanently lower the lowest volume?\n\nA: I don't think there is a way to lower the lowest volume permanently, but there is a way to make it temporarily, as long as you don't press the volume button after using this command. \nJust enter this into terminal:\nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 3.5\"\n\nand it will set it to 50% volume, using 0 for no volume, 7 for max. 1/4 is around 0.57, so  \nsudo osascript -e \"set Volume 0.57\"\n\nwill set it to that 1/4 increment.

I just bought it off of Craigslist (sketchy i know but....) When it comes up all i get is a screen with blinking file with a \"?\" On it. And if i try and do recovery mode it goes to firmware lock, im wanting to get this unlocked and usable again but preferably without taking it halfway apart. Btw i have checked with Apple, unless i have the original proof of purchase (i don't), then they can't fix the issue for me. Any help is appreciated\n\nA: You're sure that it is actually a Firmware lock? A flashing question mark just means there is no valid OS on a disk that the Mac can find.\nObviously, there would be little point in a firmware lock if it could be easily bypassed. I think your first port of call should be contacting the seller and asking them for the password, with a view to getting your money back, if possible.\nYou're sure you can't access the Firmware Password Utility when booting to Recovery?\nSome models will remove a firmware lock if the amount of RAM is changed. That's pretty much the only option. It's fairly easy to open the case and pull out some RAM.\n", "Q: How do remove administrative rights if the checkbox is disabled in Users&Groups By default in the second hand MacbookPro, I have a user called admin.

I'm on a 2014 MacBook Air, 10.14.5\nA couple of weeks ago I did a quick sweep of my files and drives to get rid of junk, mostly old photos and videos I had accumulated that I didn't need/want anymore. Everything deleted fine, except for one .mp4 file. This file, it seems, managed to get into my Bin, but is now stuck. I would really like to get rid of it - it was copied off an old USB drive and is about 5GB, which is a lot when you only have 10GB free space.\nWhen I drag it anywhere, it just copies. When the bin is emptied, I get the message \"....mp4 can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by macOS\". \nI've looked for possible solutions, including turning off System Integrity Protection and reinstalling the OS but to no avail.\nPlease help! Sorry if I've missed any details\n\nA: The '“…” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by macOS.' message is typically caused by ACL permissions set on the file which cannot be changed unless SIP is disabled. Obviously a 5GB .mp4 file is not system file that needs protection and has somehow may have had erroneous ACL permissions set on it.\nOne sure way of deleting this file without having to disable SIP or modify ACL permissions is to boot to  Recovery Mode, (⌘R when restarting the Mac), and then in Terminal (on the Utilities menu)... use the following command, e.g.:\nrm -f /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/Your_Short_Name/.Trash/filename.mp4\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The example command above assumes the main Startup volume is Macintosh HD, change as needed.\n\n*The Your_Short_Name is that which you normally see in Finder as the name on your Home folder.\n\n*If filename.mp4 has spaces in it, then escape with backslashes as shown in the example command.\n\n\nThen type reboot and press enter to restart the Mac back to normal mode boot.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*ACL - Access Control Lists See also the chmod manual page.\n\n*SIP - System Integrity Protection\n", "Q: Any way to use disassembled MacBook Pro keyboard and trackpad as input to Mac mini? I have a mid-2012 MacBook Pro (non-retina) lying around that I don't need. It does not startup, but it's keyboard and mouse work fine. I have no use for the computer anymore.\nI also have a Mac mini and I was wondering whether there is any hardware/software that allows me to use the keyboard and trackpad from my MBP as direct input to my Mac mini, just like an external keyboard/trackpad, without having to go through the OS on my MBP.\nIn other words, I was looking for some sort of adapter that would connect my keyboard and trackpad from my MBP to a USB input which I could use on the Mac mini. I do not want a solution like this: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/338568\nThanks\n\nA: In theory it is possible - but there's no on-the-shelf solution that you can go out and buy.\nYou would either have to make it yourself (requires experience with electronics and programming) or hire someone to build a solution for you. In either case, such a solution would cost many, many times more (considering the cost of your own time) than simply buying a new keyboard and mouse.\nThe keyboard connector on the mid-2012 MacBook Pro does not feature USB or anything that you can simply plugin to a new computer. Instead it is a special connector, for which you require an adapter board, and the signalling is not USB or anything standard on a Mac Mini - so you would need to create a PCB with a microcontroller or similar to convert the signals from the keyboard into a USB HID device for the Mac Mini.\n\nA: I got a broken 2011 MBP for cheap and did that \"conversion\".  You need the original motherboard for this and the keyboard and trackpad work as follows for me:\nLong story short: It works in Windows (as \"mouse\" only, no gestures on the trackpad). In MacOS and Linux (tried Ubuntu) all gestures work out of the box as well. On Android_x86 it works if you connect it BEFORE booting Android (including gestures), if you plug it in after booting, the trackpad will not work.\nOn Android phones/tablets I can't get the trackpad working AT ALL (if anyone could help me I would be super grateful!)\nSomeone did it with a mid 2012 MBP (like a guy on hackaday) who described everything in greater detail: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/proje...rackpad-from-macbook-pro-(mid-2012)-trackpad/\nIf you also get a 2012 MBP that could be enough, if you get a different year model it's probably better to get the schematics online (somewhat easy to find on Google) like I did. In general (from looking at the schematics from all kinds of different models/years) this should be possible for MacBook Pro's from 2008 to 2016 (when they introduced the force trackpad I think). MacBook Pro's before 2008 (in the old design before unibody) it should also be possible and much easier and the controller is on the back of the trackpad itself. I can't find it right now, but Googling this should bring results. Hope this helps you.\n", "Q: Removing purchased ringtones from iPhone I purchased ringtones from Apple when I had my iPhone 6s.

If I try to do a manual backup in WhatsApp settings, it sticks on preparing or either goes to max 5%. When I try daily auto backups, it says the data is backed up but in the iCloud storage management, it shows as the screenshot attached below. Only 106.1 MB of 5 GB is used in iCloud but the items below show that the WhatsApp backup on the iCloud is taking a space of 1.8 GB. \nAlso if I sign in with another iCloud ID the WhatsApp backup will work fine with that and show total space used along with the space WhatsApp backup is using.\nHow can I make it work as expected?\n\n\nA: Go to WhatsApp - Settings - Chats - Backup, and see how much space Whatsapp is trying to upload (you can choose to not include videos to reduce most of the size)\nNow, there are 2 Whatsapp backup switches to handle, they are both on by default, hence, by default, WhatsApp is an odd and inconvenient outlier since (compared to iCloud Photo library) it literally duplicates the space required if both switches are on, let me explain:\n1st switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > scroll down to see the switch (this switch creates a live backup that allows for an independent backup, meaning you don't need to restore your whole iphone to restore this backup, you can delete Whatsapp Only and said backup will be detected when you reinstall Whatsapp). You get to pick your frequency\n2nd switch: iPhone Settings app > Tap your name in the top > iCloud > Manage Storage > click \"Backcup\" green icon row > Click your device > here you have a list of your TOTAL apps, each might save a tiny bit of settings info for each app (not the app itself), this is a packaged backup that also saves your downloaded app list (no matter if you switch off every app). So, Here you see WhatsApp too (2nd switch) <- if on, Whatsapp backup will take 2x space of your total iCloud space. As I understand, this backup can only be accessed if you restore the whole iPhone (whole package see). \nPost-context: for years, I've turned off the 2nd switch with no problems. But ever since iOS 13, background activity is a mess for Whatsapp, and even though I have more than enough space, auto-daily Whatsapp backup is not happening. I now have the question if I can invert the switches, and still be able to access WhatsApp backup by only deleting and reinstalling the whatsapp app, not the whole iPhone. This question arises since the packaged backup (2nd switch) for the rest of the apps (including WhatsApp) works flawlessly, daily, perfectly fine.\nTIP:: It doesn't matter if you have iCloud Photo library on on both sections, Apple is smart about this and only backcups once (only takes space one time), that's why I say WhatsApp is an inconvenient-odd outlier when it comes to both switches management.\nWith all this, maybe your backup is stuck since you have a 2.5Gb Whatsapp backup to be uploaded, which (if both switches on) requires 5Gb of free space. <- but in my case, not even having the double free space does the trick, auto-backup is not happening.\n", "Q: Which exact Windows 7 ISO is required for Boot Camp v6.1.0 on macOS High Sierra?

Occasionally my machine will have a kernel_task instance max out the CPU:\n\nThis can last from minutes to sometimes hours. The machine is effectively unusable in this state. Restarting doesn't help; a new kernel_task pops up again until it finishes whatever it's doing.\nHow can I find out what this process is doing?\n\nA: TLDR; If your MacBook Pro runs hot or shows a high % CPU for the kernel task, try charging on the right and not on the left.\n\nHigh kernel_task CPU Usage is due to high chassis temperature caused by charging. In particular Left Thunderbolt port usage.\nSolutions include:\n\n*\n\n*Move charging from the left to the right side. If you have a second charger then plug it in on the right side. Avoid plugging everything on the right side (see last paragraph below).\n\n*Unplug something from the left side. Either power or another accessory until the battery is full.\n\n*Force fans to max before plugging in. iStatMenus has an easy Sensors -> Fans menu item to do so. This only helps in marginal conditions.\n\n*Move to a cooler room.\n\n*If using both laptop display and external display try switching to just one or the other (I switched to external only, laptop lid closed). Some MBP (eg 15\" Intel touchbar models) have a design quirk where this config can get hotter than it should.\n\nProof:\nActual CPU temperature or application CPU usage is uncorrelated with kernel_task. A hot CPU is throttled by reducing its clock speed, not by scheduling fake no-op load.\nThe graphs below are from iStatMenus. The machine had been used on battery then plugged in.\nState A a USB-C hub (a mouse and keyboard, plus power) and a USB-C HDMI 2.0 adapter, both on the left side. You can see the Thunderbolt Left Proximity temperature sensor rise quickly. About 3-4 minutes later the dreaded kernel_task high CPU usage starts.\nState B cures the kernel_task problem by moving power from the left ports to the right. The left side temperature drops and the kernel_task goes away within about 15 seconds.\nThis is causal. Moving power back to the left side, restoring State A, quickly restores the temperatures and kernel_task again comes back after 3-4 minutes. Again moving power back to the right side, restoring State B, resolves the problem immediately.\nState C shows that simply having stuff plugged in to TB ports raises their temperature significantly. Both the hub (mouse and keyboard ONLY) and HDMI adapter individually raise the temperature about 10 degrees, and 15 degrees together.\n\n(all other temperatures were both low and flat. Under 55 degrees.)\nNote that high temperature on the right side appears to be ignored by the OS. Plugging everything into the two right ports instead of the left raised the Right temperatures to over 100 degrees, without the fans coming on. No kernel_task either, but the machine becomes unusable from something throttling.\nErgo, high CPU usage by kernel_task is caused by high Thunderbolt Left Proximity temperature, which is caused by charging and having normal peripherals plugged in at the same time.\n2017 15\" Macbook Pro, MacOS 10.14.5\n\nTo actually answer the question:\n\nHow can I find out what this process is doing?\n\nThe only way to actually ask the kernel what it's doing is to attach a kernel debugger. That means getting a debug kernel from Apple, rebooting, then using a second Mac to attach to the debugged machine. You can then examine stack traces and guess what they mean.\nOtherwise guessing and testing is the only way. Of course that leads to false conclusions more often than not.\n\nA: Today I had this problem.\nInterestingly, after changing the port I'd been using for charging the laptop and using a different port of the laptop, the CPU usage dropped:\n\n\nA: If you're encountering this on Macbook Pro 16\" (2019), this seems to be a well-known problem regarding the laptop body not being able to handle the heat from both the CPU and GPU when external monitors are connected. The ultimate solution seems to be to use an eGPU... which would probably not be practical for most people.\nAn AMD Community thread further pointed out that the culprit is that the dGPU goes on full drive and draws ~20W of power whenever the laptop outputs to multiple monitors, seemingly because the driver lets the dGPU memory run on full clock speed \"to avoid tearing\". This quickly leads to the chassis overheating. Outputting to only one monitor (the count includes the built-in monitor), with no scaling or integer scaling of the resolution, seems to reduce the power usage to ~9W and thus mostly solve the issue.\nFrom the sensor data, it seems that the trigger for the throttling were most likely the Thunderbolt Left/Right Proximity temperatures.\nUpdate: Now I still connect my MBP to multiple monitors (the dGPU draws ~20W), but I followed the advice from one comment and bought a small desktop fan to point at the MBP... The temperature seems to be mostly under control now and I don't get kernel_task kicking in most of the time. You'd think that you wouldn't need such a hack on the supposedly best laptop you can buy out there, though I guess there are no perfect laptops and I'd still rather stick with Macbook for now.\nUpdate 2: I finally had my eGPU set up and as expected, the MBP 16\" hasn't suffered from throttling yet since then. I guess you could still consider this as an option if all other alternatives fail. You don't need a fancy/expensive graphics card. I am driving one 4K display and 2 additional displays with an RX 580 without any issue.\nUpdate 3: Now I see some folks recommending limiting the CPU frequency with Turbo Boost Switcher. I didn't try it while I was using my MBP 16\" since I already had the eGPU (BTW I'm now using ARM Macs where this problem is completely gone), but it might be worth checking out.\n\nA: First measure the temperature around the Mac and then see if cooler air reduces this.\n\n*\n\n*Why is kernel_task using so much CPU?\n\n*What exactly does kernel_task do?\nIn your case, Skype and Firefox are getting all the cycles left over due to running hot. Windowserver and kernel just do the bidding of the other programs. Also, for a longer term view of what the CPU is doing, watch the energy tab in activity monitor.\nBy closing the apps that take CPU, you can “let the system run cool”.  Running like this won’t hurt things, just there are thermal limits so more efficient apps or less demanding tabs / video / content lets you get more work done before the system protects itself.\nAlso on Catalina, you can see actual GPU usage in Activity Monitor and test changes to browser settings if you think GPU is putting the machine into thermal throttling states.\n\nA: Macbook pro 15\" 2018, I have a usb c adapter (7 in 1) 2 monitors, and 2 external usb hdd, the adapter on right side and on the left only charging, I have a few months that I can't work in multitask only a few apps and the macbook just starts burning out extremely, I discover this kernel_task service going to thousands!! on percent column on the activity monitor, after play around connecting on different ports (hdmi, usbc and the dock) the kernel_task just go back to normally!!! my working configuration was move the charger to the right side and one of the monitor cables to the left, so on the left I just have a usbc-hdmi cable and on the right side I have the dock with 2 usb ports used along with the hdmi for the second monitor and the charger, great testing Adam!!\n\nA: Running spindump and or sample process from the activity monitor may help provide you with more information about what’s going on. Try to keep notice of when the CPU usage climbs and then look at the CPU Time on the other items listed in activity Monitor. You may notice a certain process starting up around the same time.  Looking into threads in/out can help diagnose too. The issue could be either a bug within the kernel itself or whatever is requesting CPU time.  It’s okay to have the CPU jump up every now and then if you don’t notice any system performance or temperature issues. Macs are built with their CPUs to withstand very high temps. \nIf you download a lot of apps the Launch Daemons, Launch Agents, and startup apps can add up quickly, possibly consuming CPU. It seems your system is having a lot of wake ups. Something could be hung up? You could also run “top” and “lsof”  to get an idea of what the kernel is talking to.   Also opening console and checking out the logs for any repeating errors helps. Testing a new user account will isolate any user related issues. \nLook at you kernel panics and logs to see if there any reoccurring issues.\nMake sure your fan starts spinning up when the computer gets warm. If not it could be a SMC issue.  You can download software to control the speed of the fans to see if it reduces the CPU %.  \nThe instruments app that comes with Xcode has some debugging and tracking features that also can help. \n\nA: I own a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016). The theory given in accepted answer is correct that the cause of high cpu usage by kernel_task is due to the fact that you are plugging the charger in sockets at left. Using sockets at right immediately fixes the problem and the cpu usage for kernel_task dropped as well. However following are my findings,\n\n*\n\n*The problem did not occur till the MacOS Catalina update. The charging from left as well as right was fine on High Sierra and Catalina in my experience. I hope that Big Sur will acknowledge the problem and possibly fix it. You can try downgrading the OS and see if it fixes the problem.\n\n\n*I recently replaced 3 year old stock thermal paste with Thermal Grizzly's Kyronaut and cleaned the dust accumulated over years with an anti-static brush. The results are amazing. I am no longer facing the over cpu utilisation by kernel_task while charging from either side. The fans are at 2000(ish)RPM on idle whereas it was 2600(ish)RPM.\nI would really recommend the second option as it is much easier, cheap and doesn't incorporates any risk of any kind.\n\nA: As it persists for a very long time, and it persists across restarts, it seems likely that your problem is caused by a hardware problem - namely lack of cooling. You do not describe which type of computer you have, but try looking at its cooling to see if it's working as intended. You might have a broken fan, lots of dust or similar.\nThe kernel_task virtual process does, amongst other things, throttle CPU usage in order to keep the CPU below its maximum operating temperature. The purpose is to keep the CPU from shutting down unexpectedly. kernel_task does this by ensuring that the CPU is doing nothing for long periods of time - essentially making sure the CPU uses as little power as possible, which means that it gives off less heat. This makes it seem like kernel_task is using a lot of CPU, but in reality it is not.\n\nA: Edit: Please read through the post as to how I came to the solution, since the underlying factors of how I experienced the slowdown and found the solution are also important, especially to those with similar setups. This is not a lengthy \"I have this problem too\" comment, since though I do have the same kernel_task issue, the conditions of how I was having it as well as my setup are NOT the same as most here.\n\nI've been having this problem on occasion back then with my previous MBP152011 (yes, the one with the nasty GPU issue) which slowed down while charging. A battery replacement kind of fixed the problem, but, with the GPU issue, it wasn't really long after that I had to replace it. It did serve me well for more than seven years (5 years original Motherboard GPU + 2 year replaced motherboard).\nI got a second-hand MBP 15 2014 in 2018, which was in pristine condition. The previous owner is a photographer and he hasn't really used the MBP when he sold it to me.\nIt had a few issues, specifically, a busted speaker, which I do not really mind, and a USB port that's very choosy when it comes to USB hubs, but I finally found one that works well enough.\nNow, after two years of using it, it was scheduled for a battery replacement since the battery started to bloat. I was able to use the Thunderbolt ports with no issue, but I was using the one farther from the charging port ever since I got second external monitor. The first external monitor has always been connected to the HDMI port, which was on the right side.\nI started getting the slowdown (kernel_task cpu overload) before the battery replacement, so I thought that that had something to do with it, and replacing the battery, and an SMC reset would fix it.\nIt didn't. I get a massive CPU slowdown while the MBP was charging, often between 40-80% charge, but sometimes, even beyond that. I don't have any other third party apps installed that shows in Activity Monitor or Stats, so I was already down to the last resort: Backup, reformat, reinstall.\nI'm still on Catalina, I've been holding off on Big Sur since I don't really need the nifty new features to get by.\nI may also have a faulty GPU, as the display starts to get wonky on certain zoom settings whenever I use Adobe Illustrator, and switching to CPU display fixes that issue.\nAfter reading through the comments and responses here, mostly about using right port for charging instead of the left ports, that heat from charging affects the other port and thus also heats up the port, and by extension, the GPU. After installing stats, I noticed that my MBPs CPU diode is at 90° even after a cold start, with the fans sometimes whirring at full speed, meaning it didn't wake up from sleep. I now shutdown after every session instead of putting the sleep to preserve the battery, and I religiously follow the 40-80% as much as I can, but with the slowdown issue during charging, I often leave it plugged-in when I'm in Zoom teaching sessions (with OBS), and unplug it after a while.\nBut, since I'm using an older MBP with both TB ports on the left next to the charging port, I'm out of other solutions except the last resort of backing it up, reformatting and reinstalling.\nAs a last ditch effort, something lit up (in my head), and I switched TB ports, using the one closer to the charging port. I know that counter-intuitive based on the comments, since the charger connection itself does heat up as well when connected.\nThe result? The kernel_task cpu overload disappeared. I launched Illustrator, Zoom, OBS, VLC, Viber, Slack, along with power hungry Firefox and Safari, observing the kernel_status in Activity Monitor, and the temperatures and fans in Stats, and the temperatures were a breezy 70° with the fans at roughly 3000rpm\nI suppose the Thunderbolt port I have been using frequently has started to malfunction, causing the chassis to heat up, and since it's directly connected to the GPU, heats that up as well. So I guess in some cases, it has to do with faulty ports as well. That TB port has been well-used, more often than the other, so it has probably gone wonky for a while now when the slow down started.\nAdditional information: The charging port and the charging connector also heats up quite significantly during charging and can cause the TB ports to malfunction. Cleaning the ports and charging pins can help quite a lot, but if the pins have started to wear down, or don't pop-up anymore, this causes electricity to arc, heating the charging port a lot more. You will have to purchase a new charger.\n\nA: This is most often due to thermal throttling.\nA common issue is the voltage regulator modules (VRM) overheating which have no publicly accessible sensors to view.\nDiagnosis\nRun: sudo watch -d -t -n1 thermal levels\nWhen CPU > 100, you are being thermally throttled. You should keep an eye on this as you try to solve your issues.\nRun: sudo powermetrics --samplers smc |grep -i \"CPU die temperature\"\nThis shows your CPU temperature. If it is < 100C, its your VRM causing it.\nWhat is your ambient room temperature? >24C and you will start struggling to cool it adequately using any means.\nYou can observe throttling visually by installing the Intel Power Gadget.\nFixes\nNon-invasive\n\n*\n\n*Disable TurboBoost using Turbo Boost Switcher\n\n*Buy small desk fan and point at laptop\n\n*Elevate laptop on a laptop stand like the CoolerMaster U150R\n\n*Use air-conditioning to reduce room temperature\n\n*Sleep your laptop until the temperatures are reduced. Check thermal levels to confirm.\n\nInvasive\n\n*\n\n*VRM thermal pad mod will solve this but its risky. Be careful taking case bottom off, there are pics here to help.\n\nAlso, don't place ice bricks under the laptop - this can cause condensation and break things.\n\nA: For me this happens almost everytime I connect to an external monitor. The graphics switches to dedicated ones and the system starts to overheat in just under 5 min. Took me quite a while to figure this out. Room temperature is 27C so I don't think it's related to hot weather as well.\nFunny thing is my 7 year old laptop still works fine under same conditions (even outperforms the MBP 2019).\n\nA: It’s usually temperature. Buy a small desk fan and point it at your MacBook rear. I used to have this problem and since using a fan it never happens.\nEDIT: See my other answer\n\nA: I'll just leave this here in case it helps someone else:\nFor me, the issue went away when I switched to a charger with higher watt capacity. I accidentally had been running with a 15W charger instead of 87W. This caused the charging to be prolonged, heating up the whole computer.\n", "Q: Stop Ctrl+v doing page down in mail and safari apps (Mojave) I have same problem as Using CTRL +V in Mail app on Mac Os X but in Mojave and for more apps. \nI have Ctrl+v setup as paste in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts.

When starting up some resource-intensive software, it shows spikes in frequency or temperature.\nAre the spikes of frequency above the 2.8Ghz of the cpu specs normal?\nIs there anything I can do? It's so bad that the machine will actually shut down abruptly.\n\n\nA: Yes, frequency spikes like that are normal - it is a feature of these CPU. Intel calls this \"Turbo Boost\", and allows for for example your 2.8 Ghz Core i7 processor to Turbo Boost up to 3.8 Ghz for peak loads. The CPU automatically handles Turbo Boost, and it is only allowed to happen when all necessary conditions are fulfilled - amongst those are that the temperature is not too high, the power consumption is not too high, and not all cores are actively \"busy\".\nTemperature spikes are also perfectly normal. When the CPU is idle, it uses less power - and thus has a lower temperature than when fully utilizes. The maximum temperature you have recorded is 90 degrees - this is perfectly normal and well within the operating temperature range of the CPU.\nAs for the abrupt shutdowns of the computer - there are multiple possible causes of this - you haven't really demonstrated that overheating has anything to do with your problem, but check your fans and generally that the machine isn't full of dust. Other possible causes could be battery problems, a faulty sensor, etc.\n", "Q: brew Install encounter error /usr/local/share/texinfo is not writable ==> Installing ffmpeg dependency: texi2html\n==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/texi2html-5.0.high_sierra.b\n==> Downloading from https://akamai.bintray.com/52/5259ab2074f122f4725058d247723\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> Pouring texi2html-5.0.high_sierra.bottle.1.tar.gz\nError: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\nCould not symlink share/texinfo/html\n/usr/local/share/texinfo is not writable.\n\nany ideas?\n\nA: Try running the command:\nsudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr/local/share/texinfo\n\nand reattempting the installation.\n", "Q: Upgraded to Mojave and now MacOS won't allow me to have the same password locally as my iCloud account I upgraded a new to me MacBook Pro (Mid 2015) to Mojave and the checkbox was pre-checked to use iCloud to unlock MacOS. This setting keeps me from having the same local and iCloud password.  How do I turn off this \"feature\"? Since the Mojave security update the checkbox to disable this \"feature\" is gone from the Change Password dialog in Users and Groups.\n\nA: Apple is making it hard for you to reuse the password from the setup assistant only.\n\n\n*\n\n*Just enter a new password to get past this. \n\n\nThen if you require them to be the same, go and immediately change the password in System Preferences. Apple doesn’t store or check the passwords other than the initial setup, so you can reuse your passwords as much as you wish.\nThe only wrinkle I haven't tested lately is if you have enabled FileVault and iCloud escrows your FileVault unlock keys might still be entangled with your account password.\n\nI was going to comment on your question, but it got too long for a comment and it is opinion, so I'll share that here after answering how to get around things as best I know. \nAs for your comment about moving to windows, you are correct - we all have to pick our poison. No commercial software fails to make design and security decisions like this one that they don't bend on. \nIf we were to delve into this - the question I have for anyone (and myself) is:\n\nWhat's your use case for not having an iCloud password that's distinct from one Mac local admin password? \n\nThe security model in 2019 is using secure storage and long unique passwords to contain when a breach happens. Having a different password for cloud unifying - highly confidential and attackable information and a much shorter one you type day in and day out seems like a very reasonable baseline for everyone. Especially if you can take a second step and choose to unify both easily if you don't want to have two to remember. \nOn the other side - Imagine if Apple let the default setup keep the same password on iCloud and the Mac and your Mac FileVault backup was the same password you forgot. All your eggs are in one basket. I think they have had this happen and made the decision to inconvenience people in the name of having the discussion we are having (or I'm attempting to have) to raise the security of Mac users. \nI get you might be momentarily inconvenienced or angry, but perhaps you'll reconsider after thinking through what the long term effects of implementing what used to be are for you and your community. Anyhow - I'll get off my soapbox and hope I didn't anger anyone with some opinion here.\n", "Q: Escape every character in bash I want to take a string like this:\nExample string 59^!#&$(\n\nAnd turn it into this:\n\\E\\x\\a\\m\\p\\l\\e\\ \\s\\t\\r\\i\\n\\g\\ \\5\\9\\^\\!\\#\\&\\$\\(\n\nI've tried:\nsed -e 's/./\\\\&/g; 1{$s/^$/\"\"/}; 1!s/^/\"/; $!s/$/\"/'\nas noted here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15783701/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-when-using-bash/20053121#20053121\nBut as noted by dalelane in a comment, this does not work under vanilla installation of bash in macOS.

I know APFS is optimized for solid-state storage, so does Disk Utility not offer it for a spinning-metal disk drive?\n➥ Why is APFS not offered by Disk Utility? \n\nA: If it is not giving you the option for APFS formats, then you are likely trying to format only the logical volume within the container.\nTo show the container and physical disk in disk utility usually you have to change the view option to \"show all devices\" from \"show only volumes\",\nNow you can select and format the container as you want.\n\n\nA: Disk Utility will only offer APFS if Partition Map is \"GUID Partition Map\".\n\nIf the Partition Map is \"Master Boot Record\" APFS is not an option (and neither is encrypted HFS).\n\n\nA: Edit:\nThe problem is, that DiskUtil only shows you the Volumes on already partitioned disks.

My mum has an iMac with a 3TB fusion drive in it and she's running out of space. She loves photo and video editing. She's good with final cut but not with managing separate storage. SSD's do not go up to that size and if they did, they'd be massively expensive. The fusion drive still uses regular storage under the hood for the majority of it as far as I can tell. \nWould it be a good idea to move her home directory to a fast external hard drive? Say I get her a thunderbolt 3 capable hard drive with 8TB or 12TB, like the LaCie's. She doesn't have to try and manage several drives for her work, but she does have a ton of space afterwards. Are there any performance concerns or upgrade issues I should be aware of? \n\nA: Moving the entire user domain, instead of just the folders for Videos and Photos may be overkill, though it would keep things simple. You're not going to see any advantage from moving preferences, audio files, Word docs, etc, as they are too small and not causing any bottleneck.\nThere's no disadvantage either, except that if the Mac boots up and can't find the drive, it will create a brand new (empty) user account on the system disk. \"Where has all my stuff gone?\" \nDon't forget that you'll need another device to back up to!\nFusion drives can reduce in performance as they fill. I would recommend swapping one or more parts out for a regular SSD in due course.\n\nA: Do it!\nI got a 2018 Mac Mini as a gift but only a 256GB drive. My user profile is almost that size. So I got a 1TB SSD and a nice USB-C/Thunderbolt case and copied the profile over there. Works a treat for me.\nOnce you have copied her profile to the external drive go into System Preferences > Users and Groups and Control Click on her user name and select Advanced Options. In there you can choose the user folder on the external drive.\nOnce that is done reboot and delete the old user folder.\nWith a nice fast drive with a quality case and a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 interface she will not likely notice any slowdown at all.\nNote that I didn't move the Applications (or any other) folder as I had enough room for those. While there is no officially supported way to move those folders to another location I believe you can still do it with a hard link. That is working for my Dropbox folder on another Mac just fine. And keeping everything else on the internal drive you should see little or no slowdowns due to system directories being elsewhere.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2015 High Sierra cannot merge free space partitions \n\n\n\nI think I messed everything up when I erased the content of a partition from bootcamp.  Please give simple instructions.  I have no knowledge about how storages work.  Thank you.\n\nA: The simple fix is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back everything up (apps and files and settings and possibly keychain passwords if you don’t have them written down / recorded elsewhere)\n\n*Boot to internet recovery\n\n*Erase and start with one partition\n\n\nUsing the command line to merging containers requires you to clearly understand quite a few items and processes and concepts and one mistake ruins the data. It’s like several passes on a trapeze at the circus, without a net. It takes months of experience to make it look effortless and years of experience to always succeed. \nHere’s your guide to easy and the site will be here as you gain storage knowledge. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201065\n", "Q: Force eject a device Because my drive will freeze occasionally, I would have to pull the cable out. (see the question below for more detail):\n\n\n*\n\n*Seagate Backup Plus 5 TB became unresponsive after long period of use\nI've heard that doing so will hurt (or break, in the worst scenario) the drive, so I wonder whether there is a way to force eject a device which would avoid the physical damage. I need to force eject it because the drive (like other ordinary drives) will try to read one block over and over until it reads successfully or reached timeout. When it's stuck trying to read a damaged block, the kernel will block the process/thread until there is a result. The application waiting for I/O will act as if it's stopped, so even using force quit / sigkill won't quit the application. Because the timeout is usually long for home-use HHD, the core GUI component of the system (Finder + Dock) will freeze for a long time, thus preventing normal usage. \nNote that force eject a device is not the equivalent as force unmount a partition. Force eject the HDD will make the read/write header land in the parking zone, and the drive will stop spinning.\nEdit: I replaced my drive with a new one (same model, actually) and used ddrescue to copy all the data. I did find 3 bad areas that are ~ 1 mb each. ddrescue did freeze when it encounters these bad areas (I'm using raw disk access, i.e. /dev/rdiskX), so it's not a system problem. However, I would still like to know how to force eject a mass storage device when it is stuck.\nBelow is the etrecheck report:\nEtreCheck version: 5.0.5 (5A016)\nReport generated: 2019-07-10 18:33:17\nDownload EtreCheck from https://etrecheck.com\nRuntime: 4:41\nPerformance: Good\n\nProblem: Other problem\nDescription: \nHDD freeze\n\nMajor Issues:\n  Anything that appears on this list needs immediate attention. \n  Time Machine backup out-of-date - The last Time Machine backup is over 10 days old.\n  System Integrity Protection disabled - System Integrity Protection is disabled.

The preview (which has no value to me) takes up most of the available space and the file information I want to see is hidden.\nAll I want to see is the size, creation and modification dates. I would also like to get rid of the \"more\" section, which is useless and just takes up space.\nIn the image below, the preview takes up most of the space, the \"more\" section takes up nearly 1/4 of the space and of the 3 things I want to see most, only the size is available. The name and filetype is already displayed on the column to the left, it's pointless to repeat it under the preview.\n\nI know I could switch to the list view, but I've used the column view forever (since 1990) and it was extremely useful, now it's just a daily annoyance. I also don't want to have to navigate to directory using one view, then switch views to select a file, then go back to column view to navigate, etc.\nI'm not a fan of Windows, but I find I can configure Windows Explorer to suit me much better than the Mac OS Finder as I can get rid of the preview and show just the information I want. \nIs there any way to do that in the Finder?\n\nA: In Finder, select View → Preview options.

It still works that way in Mail in Mojave.\nBut with Safari and Pages all you get with drag&drop is a link (without the page title), which you then need to edit to replace the displayed text with i.e. the page title.\nIs there a way (maybe via AppleScript) to insert title & URL of a Safari tab into a Pages document without having to manually edit it afterwards?\n\nA: The ideal solution, with the current tab of the front window of Safari set to the desired address, one would then in Pages press a keyboard shortcut to, at the cursors present location, create a website link matching the documents style (font size, etc,) having the Title and URL of the Safari target pasted into the Pages document.\nOff the top of my head, if that's even doable, it would probably require using AppleScriptObjC, which unfortunately is not something I know how to do, rather than using plain vanilla basic AppleScript.\nThat said, let me offer an example that works for me in macOS High Sierra and Pages 7.1.\nUsing an Automator service1 with a Run AppleScript action, set for Pages, and assigning it a keyboard shortcut in System Preference > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, the example AppleScript code, shown further below, creates a website link on its own line directly after the line the cursor is on when the keyboard shortcut is pressed.\nWith this particular code, it needs to be done in this manner; however, one can then cut and paste it where desired in the document and remove the extra line added to the document. It's not the ideal solution, but it does get the job done with the least amount of hassle while using this particular method.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Service1, setting: Service receives [no input] in [Pages]\n\n\n*\n\n*1 In macOS Mojave, an Automator service is now called a Quick Action.\n\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code with the example AppleScript code, shown further below.\n\n*Save the Automator service as, e.g.,: Add Safari Weblink to Pages\n\n*In System Preference > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > e.g. Add Safari Weblink to Pages, assign it a keyboard shortcut, e.g.,: ^⌘L (Control-Command-L)\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: I wanted the least number of keys to press and something close to the default ⌘K, and ^⌘L was it. It also does not step on any other default keys in Pages.\n\n\n*In Pages, with a document opened, press ^⌘L to create the website link of the current tab of the frontmost Safari window.\n\n\nWith a little practice, the following steps will become second nature:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the target webpage in Safari, letting it be the frontmost Safari window.\n\n*In Pages, with a document opened, press:\n\n\n*\n\n*^⌘L, and wait until Add Link pop-up dialog disappears.\n\n*⌘X\n\n*delete (Removes the added line.)\n\n*Set the cursor to where you want the website link inserted.\n\n*⌘C\n\n\n*This should only take but a few seconds total.\n\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\nif not running of application \"Safari\" then return\n\ntell application \"Safari\" to set |Title & URL| to {name, URL} of current tab of front window\ndelay 0.1\n\nset the clipboard to first item of |Title & URL| -- Title of front Safari document.\ndelay 0.1\n\ntell application \"Pages\"\n    activate\n    delay 0.1\n    if name of front window is in {\"Choose a Template\", \"\"} then return\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code 124 using {command down} -- Right Arrow Key - Send cursor to end of line.\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 36 -- Enter Key - Send cursor to beginning of new line.\n    delay 0.1\n    keystroke \"v\" using {option down, shift down, command down} -- Paste and Match Style. (Title of front Safari document.)\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 123 using {shift down, command down} -- Left Arrow Key - Highlight pasted Title.\n    delay 0.1\n    tell current application to set the clipboard to second item of |Title & URL| -- URL of front Safari document.\n    delay 0.1\n    keystroke \"k\" using {command down} -- Pages > Format > Add Link > Webpage -- (When some text is highlighted.)\n    delay 0.1\n    keystroke \"v\" using {command down} -- Paste (URL of front Safari document.)\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 36 -- Enter Key - Needed to set pasted URL, otherwise it stays as the default URL.\n    delay 0.1\n    key code 53 -- Escape Key - Dismiss the Add Link pop up dialog box.\nend tell\n\nset the clipboard to \"\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: The example AppleScript code makes use of the Clipboard in order to use Paste and Match Style in the Pages document, and then clears the Clipboard. Keep this in mind so as not to loose something that's there and nowhere else if applicable. Additionally, if the length of Title exceeds the length of the line it's pasted to, only the last line of the pasted Title will be highlighted when the website link is created. This is one of the drawbacks of using just plain vanilla basic AppleScript verses AppleScriptObjC.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans, if not running of application \"Safari\" then return and if name of front window is in {\"Choose a Template\", \"\"} then return, it does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors.\nYou might also find that the value of the delay command, in some instances, may need to be adjusted for use on your system, adjust as/if necessary.\n\n\n\nA: A general solution is to combine your AppleScript (Script Editor)(/System/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app)  with an app launcher like Alfred.\nScript\ntell application \"Safari\" to tell document 1\n    set the clipboard to \"[#]: \" & URL & \" \\\"\" & name & \"\\\"\"\nend tell\n\nIn this case, the result string is formatted as the second part of a Markdown reference-style link. E.g.:\n[link text][1]\n\n[1]: url \"title\"\n\nHotkey Trigger\n\n*\n\n*In your app launcher, create a hotkey workflow\n\n*In Alfred, click Settings > Workflows, then click + > Blank workflow\n\n*Add a Workflow Name; other values are optional\n\n*Click + > Triggers > Hotekey\n\n*\n\n*In the Hotkey Settings tab, assign a Hotkey value. E.g. ⌥C\n\n*Leave Action as Pass through to workflow or your launcher's equivalent\n\n*Leave Argument set to None.\n\n*Go to the Related Apps tab\n\n*Verify have focus is the value assigned to Hotkey is...active when..apps\n\n*Click Save\n\n\n\n*Click + Actions > Run Script\n\n*Set Language to /usr/bin/osascript (AS); leave other options set to their default values\n\n*Paste your version of the above script into the Script box\n\n*Click Save\n\n*Drag the Hotkey box's node and connect it to the Run Script box\n\nThat's it! Now clicking ⌥C in Safari lets you paste URL and title values in any app in any format with the standard Paste keyboard shortcut — ⌘P.\nAs above, you should be able to run your script as a service. You can assign a shortcut key to run the service by going to System Preferences > Keyboard > Services.\nPS: You can also download my Alfred Workflow and scripts (plain text and .scpt) from GitHub.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, I wanted to copy the page title, so to solve it I made an Automator Quick Action which appears in Safari's Safari->Services menu. It gets the page title and puts it in the clipboard. It probably could be improved to also get the link. Note the \"no input\" choice.\n\n\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    set mytitle to name of current tab in window 1\nend tell\n\nreturn mytitle\n\nI got the Apple Script from this answer.\n", "Q: Why is my external HDD active when I'm not using it? I have a partitioned external HDD (orange LaCie), with one partition for Time Machine. All partitions are Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted). The HDD is GUID Partition Map.\nI'm not (consciously) doing anything with the disk right now, and Time Machine is turned off at the moment.\nWhy is the light on the HDD blinking (and the HDD active, because I can feel that)? What is it doing?\nI am running macOS Mojave 10.14.5.\n\nA: It's probably the 'Spotlight' indexing that is busy indexing the drive 's content.\n\nA: This could be a few things: \n\n\n*\n\n*In case you chose to encrypt your backups, it may be FileVault2 is currently encrypting the disk. Here you find some instructions how to check that.\n\n*As In the accepted answer, it could be spotlight indexing the disk. \n\n*It could be your disk's firmware doing some maintenance task. However, in that case the indicator LED will probably not be flashing. I have a Seagate Archive HDD that uses shingled magnetic recording and practically after any write operation it does a few minutes of reorganising the data. This is done internally by the disk and is intransparent to the user and to macOS.\n\n\nA: Another possibility is macOS can be performing a disk check (fsck) in the background. This typically happens if you do not eject the disk properly before unplugging it; then the next time you plug it in, macOS will run fsck in the background on the disk before mounting it. (I'm not sure what the behaviour is for disk formatted with Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted), but I have experienced this at least with exFAT disks.)\n", "Q: Airpods use on macOS resets double tap action I use my apple airpods with lots of different platforms. On windows, iOS & Android everything is fine.\nOn macOS everything works too but it resets the double tap action to next track on both L/R (I like to have play/pause)\nI have second generation airpods. Does anyone else know why this is happening and how to stop it?\nFYI: I use tooth fairy on my mac to quickly connect and disconnect and am running the current 10.4.5 build of mojave.\n\nA: AirPods double tap settings are unique to each Apple device. You’ll need to adjust the double tap settings on your Mac directly to mimic what you have on iOS.\nI personally have different settings on my iPhone and Mac, but that’s a personal decision.\nIt seems like non-apple devices inherit compatible settings (pause/play, next track, but not Siri etc.) from your iOS double tap settings.\nFeatures That Work on Android\n\nOut of the box, AirPods functionality on Android is quite limited, but the double tap feature works. When you double tap on one of the AirPods, it will play or pause the music. If you've customized your AirPods using an iOS device, next track and previous track gestures will also work, but Siri won't, nor will \"Hey Siri\" on AirPods 2 as that requires an Apple device. \n\n", "Q: Mojave 10.14 Mouse Hover Suddenly Not Working Today the mouse hovering functionality on my Mac simply stopped working. Moving my mouse to the dock causes one icon to enlarge, but then sliding left and right does not cause the others to enlarge.\nIn menus I can click on a menu, but then the menu items don't light up as I pull down.  I can click on a submenu to see it but I don't see it on hover.\nThis behavior happens with both my Logitech mouse and my Apple Trackpad.\nThis behavior came out of nowhere, I restarted my Mac but it did not help.\n\nA: Hover is something that comes out of the gesture recognition engine on macOS so it's more complicated than simply the cursor is now over a link. It matters if more than one finger (multitouch) is detected and it also needs a stable input.\n\n*\n\n*One rare cause of this is flakey USB that causes a (possibly invisible) shake to the input - this is filtered out, so you might not see it.\n\n\n*The leading cause of this is when there are more than one device connected. For Macs with a trackpad, if there is motion detected on the build in trackpad, the external device may be demoted to \"secondary device\"\nI learned this when the same issue plagued me for a few days. The cause and solution was similar as well - little did I know, the USB-C dock I had my Mac plugged into at work also had a USB mouse plugged into it, hidden behind the monitors. As soon as I unplugged that mouse, the issue immediately went away.\nIf anyone is having this issue, try seeing if there is a mouse or wireless mouse dongle plugged in that you might have forgotten about. Also, the act of disconnecting a USB device or Bluetooth device and re-connecting it (which is a different / quicker step than unpairing and pairing) that also seems to cure when a hover motion doesn't get detected.\n\nA: It's confirmed that issues were caused by some wireless signal interferences between/amount USB wireless devices (especially for USB+Bluetooth wireless combo devices) and the USB/Thunderbolt ports on Mac systems after firmware and OS upgrade of Mac systems.\nSolution: Please replace your USB+Bluetooth wireless devices with wired/USB-only devices, before Apple or Logitech may release a fix for this problem.\n\nA: This started happening to me today on Big Sur and I was able to fix it by switching my KVM to another computer and back to my Mac. ‍♂️\n", "Q: Does Apple Watch automatically stop walk/run workout? One problem I commonly have with activity and workout trackers is that I forget to stop recording when I finish my walk or run, and end up including a bus ride or drive as part of the workout. This skews the data and mostly makes it useless for tracking.\nAnd furthermore, most trackers don’t make it easy to trim or crop an activity after it has been completed.\nDoes the Apple Watch automatically stop recording a walk or run workout when it detects you’re moving faster than a human could possibly run?\n\nA: watchOS 6 (set to release in fall 2019) will include enhancements to automatic workout detection.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Watch: All of the health and fitness features, explained\n\nAutomatic workout detection\nWhen the Apple Watch senses you're beginning a workout, you'll get an alert asking if you want it to start tracking. You can respond to that notification to choose your workout type and beyond a session.\nBest of all, if you missed out on a few minutes before beginning to track the workout, Apple Watch will give you retroactive credit for that, too. And if you forget to stop tracking when your workout is over, the Apple Watch will detect that and automatically end it.\n\n\nA: Source.\nFor watchOS 5, you can use the Workout Detection to remind you to start and stop a workout.\n\nAfter you physically begin a workout but forget to tell your watch about it, you'll receive a tap on the wrist after a few minutes along with a notification on the watch face. On this message, you can tap to confirm and record the workout, change the workout type, mute the notifications for the day, or dismiss the information.

We're looking to have macOS VMs running on Mac Mini hosts (and maybe Mac Pro hosts once they're out).\nIs it possible to have the VMs connected at 10Gig ethernet by using something like a Sonnet 10G Thunderbolt 3 Adapter? Would Parallels support something like this?

The power button is not working. Other then that the system was working fine. I tried to fix the power button by opening the back cover, disconnecting the battery, followed by removing and reattaching the keyboard wire. After I connected the battery and booted the system by connecting the MagSafe connector, the system booted really slow (I have an SSD, and it usually takes ~10 seconds but it took 3 mins) and the fans were at full speed.\nThe system became really slow and apps launched really slowly. I check the Activity Monitor and CPU was idle. So I figured out that I need to reset the SMC. But I don't know how to do it, as the power button is not working. I tried resetting with smcflasher.efi (from the smcupdate.pkg) by booting to rEFIt. It says the reset option is unavailable and figured it out that Apple locked down resetting/modifying firmware externally.\nIs there any other method to reset SMC?\n\nA: If you open the system and disconnect all power, eventually the SMC has to restart, but that's not necessarily the same as a signaled clear.\nWe would need to have the schematics of the SMC and the firmware to know for sure, but if you don't feel you want to repair the keyboard and can't otherwise use the Mac without an SMC reset, I would disconnect the battery for maybe 24 to 48 hours. You've already done the brief disconnect of power so this likely is a situation where you need to have the boards replaced or repaired.\nAssuming there's no damage due to repairs, $300 for a mail in repair was an option until the 2013/2012 models went vintage.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\nIf it's purchased in Turkey or California, you still have time for the Apple repair at the approximate cost above.\n", "Q: Mac Air (2015) keeps shutting off immediately after being unplugged from charger My air which is 4 years old now keeps shutting off immediately if it gets disconnected from the charger.

Under Windows, the disk is partitioned as:\n - EFI Healthy Primary (or something to that effect) 200MB\n - Primary (Bootcamp C:) ~999GB or so (NTFS format)\nUnder the MacOs (Mojave in my case) the disk shows as one volume (Bootcamp), under the device name (which still shows as Samsung Portable etc. etc.), and it says 25GB or so used (which makes sense as that's the Windows10 OS, and 975GB Free.\nWhat I want:\nI installed WIn10 on the external for those rarer occasions I need Windows, but now I feel 1TB space is too much. I want to re-purpose quite a bit of space in the Samsung SSD for the Mac. Specifically I would like to partition so that I have\n\n\n*\n\n*a TimeMachine volume (say 500MB - my MBP is only 256GB)\n\n*Extra space for saving other Mac files (I'm happy to make this exclusive to Mac, but can also think about using exFAT format for common use)\n\n*The rest of space (say 200-250GB) for the Windows10 OS as is. (basically I want to shrink Windows to a smaller size)\n\n\nIs there a way I can safely do what I want without messing up the installation of the Win10 OS in the SSD? It was a tedious process to achieve and I already messed it up once. I first had partitioned in Windows, creating a clearly defined volume destined for the MBP. I then tried to partition that from the Mac, and somehow it gave me an error while erasing the partition (out of space?), and it actually caused me to lose the EFI volume that Windows needed to boot. That little bit seems to be indiscernible, and invisible to the MacOS and must have been tampered with. It rendered the external SSD unbeatable for Windows!\nSo, after having re-installed everything, can anyone recommend a safe method to tamper with the partitions now, without messing up the windows installation already residing in the SSD?\nThanks\n\nA: The safest was is to do this from within Windows.  You want to shrink your Windows partition until it is 200-250GB and the rest is free space.\nThe easiest way to do this is to go to Disk Management in Windows, right click on the Windows partition and select \"Shrink Volume\". \nIf this doesn't allow you to shrink sufficiently (sometimes there are unmovable files) you can install the free utility Minitool Partition Wizard (again in Windows) which will move these files for you during reboot. \nThere is a full tutorial of both methods taken from Partition Wizard website here : Two Easy and Effective Ways to Free Shrink Windows Partition\nmacOS will not let you partition a drive if the EFI partition is less than 200MB (while Windows will by default create a 100MiB EFI partition) which would explain your previous problem.  \nAs you say the EFI partition is now 200MB you can create your 2 new partitions in the newly reclaimed free space either in Windows or macOS Disk Utility as you prefer.  If you make a exFAT partition this can be formatted from either OS but the Time Machine partition must be formatted (erased) as HFS from within macOS.\n", "Q: Why other apple ID-s appearing constantly? I hard restarted, restored and updated my Iphone X 'casue it constanty kept turning off in the most random moments. When I started to setup and backup I saw other 5 apple ID-s popping up (I've never seen them before, and they're not mine), Iphone said that there were some purchases made with these ID-s and it wanted me to type in the passwords. Is it possible that I have some malware/spyware on my phone or it was hacked?\nThanks for any helpful answers in advance.\n\nA: It sounds like you are restoring the phone from a backup (iCloud or otherwise) and such a backup is placing all of your old apps back on your phone, which it is supposed to do.\nIt sounds like what is happening that some of the apps were downloaded under another AppleID. Whether it is someone who was using your phone and did this or the apps are from other sources.\nThe only way to get around this (without jailbreaking your phone) is to cancel all app installs and then download them one at a time from the app store under your personal AppleID. Apps that are associated with your current AppleID will have the download icon next to them (cloud with a downward pointing arrow) all others will have have a \"GET\" or \"BUY\" button.\n", "Q: What is the small microphone icon floating on top of the screen in macOS and how do I turn it off?

This doesn't have a database to compare with others but can give you actual speeds for your internal and external drive.\n\nA: AJA System Test is another commonly used tool to benchmark disk performance for the Mac. It offers graphs and a text report of performance instead of just a dial indicating transfer speed like Black Magic.\nIf you want to test random I/O, which neither AJA or Black Magic do, you can use the tool fio like you can on Linux.

In preparation for macOS 10.15, I'm reviewing my list of installed applications and removing those that are 32-bit. On the list of apps identified by System Report, I see two things that are 32-bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Canon MP530.ds\n\n*Canon MP600.ds\n\n\nBoth of them reside in /Library/Image Capture/TWAIN Data Sources/, and they are the only contents of the folder.\nThese look like printers, but I have no idea if I ever installed those models. The \"Last Modified\" dates are nearly a decade ago. What are these files for, and is it safe to remove them?\n\nA: The MP500 and MP600 are Canon all-in-one printer/scanners.\nTWAIN is a driver protocol for exchanging information with scanners.\nMPXXX.ds files are Canon drivers for the scanner component of these AIO printers.  Canon documentation indicates they can be removed by opening \"Library, Image Capture, and TWAIN Data Sources, and move Canon MPXXX.ds to the trash\", \"if the MP Navigator or the MP drivers are no longer required.\"\nGiven the age of the MP600, unless you're still actively using one of these printers, the drivers should be safe to remove.\n\nA: You can use time machine or another backup just in case, then remove these. Image Capture can import from scanners, so those would support some canon devices. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.twain.org/about/\nIf Apple installed them, you’ll likely get updates when needed and unless you get a problem with a scanner and can’t find newer drivers, you’ll have your backup. \n", "Q: Do Shared Albums take up storage space on iPhone 8/iOS 12? I am running iOS 12.3.1 on an iPhone 8. Currently, the only photos I have in my Photos app are in Shared Albums, mostly created by others. I've cleared everything else, including Recently Deleted.\nBut, when I go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage, it indicates that the Photos app is taking up 1.3GB of storage. Is that from the Shared Albums thumbnails, or are there phantom photos taking up space in the Photos app? \n\nA: For sure enabling shared albums takes up local space on both macOS and iOS.\nApple does save space and download lower resolution / lower fidelity thumb nails, and the quality is generally quite good so not everyone notices that you are saving space when you allow iOS to download and save space from iCloud pictures.\nYou wouldn't be able to know if you have phantom photos unless you remove the iCloud from your settings - that will sync up any data and then remove all local copies - leaving all your iCloud photos intact.\nThen you can re-measure and/or restore the entire OS on the iPhone and be sure it's super clean. I've not seen the system report photos when they aren't visible in the app, but it could happen. I have seen \"free space\" get low when some data goes \"missing\" and a restore has always cleaned that up for me - as has erase all content and settings on iOS.\n", "Q: How can I deploy an ad-hoc iOS app to a user without a Mac?

This does not require a computer at all for the end-user installing the app. They will simply need to download the TestFlight app from the App Store, and use that to download and install your app.\nThe other options you have for deploying ad-hoc iOS apps are:\n1) Using Apple Configurator (Mac-only)\n2) Using Xcode (Mac-only)\n3) Using iTunes (requires specific version of iTunes)\n4) Using OTA installation\nOptions 1) and 2) are Mac-only, and thus cannot be used from Windows.\nOption 3) requires you to have the 12.6.4 (or older) version of iTunes that includes the App Store. You can download it here for Mac and Windows:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208079\nOption 4) requires you to have a SSL-enabled web server that you can distribute your app from. You'll need to create a special plist-file for you app and link to it using the itms-services protocol.

It’s not clear how much support is dropped. \nIs there any supported way for a 64-bit app to request the kernel to create a 32-bit code segment?\n\nA: Thanks to Ken Thomases from CodeWeavers, who has posted quite a bit of information on wine-devel mailing list on how CrossOver runs Win32 apps on macOS Catalina, we now know that Apple enabled i386_set_ldt syscall for 64-bit processes.\nSo, aside from doing hack described in Max Coplan's answer, it's possible to create 32-bit segments in 64-bit processes.\nAn excerpt from Ken's mail:\n\nSpeaking of code segments, the big thing that Catalina provides that enables this all to work is the ability to create 32-bit code segments in a 64-bit process.  For that, they enabled the use of i386_set_ldt() in 64-bit processes.  The big caveat though, is that this functionality is restricted by System Integrity Protection (SIP).  For now, your best bet to get this working for yourself is to disable SIP.  (CrossOver doesn't require that, but the mechanism by which we accomplish that is in flux internally to Apple.  When it settles down, I'll update this thread.)\n\n\nA: netkas has experimented with this here.  It seems like Apple has not removed 32-bit capability from the Darwin kernel itself, but merely disabled it as well as removing all the 32-bit libraries from the system.\nTo re-enable 32-bit processing from the kernel, just disable Apple's disabling function by adding no32exec=0 to your boot-args (sudo nvram boot-args=\"no32exec=0\" if SIP is disabled, if not run the same command from Recovery mode).\nTo get the 32-bit libraries back, just copy them from Mojave\nSources: Bringing back 32-bit apps to life\n\n\nA: Unfortunately the answer is just flat no.  As stated here and here Apple started requiring AppStore apps to be 64 bit in 2018.  They have been working on this for a while and with Catalina they are finally shutting the door entirely.\nEdit:  This sheds more light on app development.\n", "Q: Issue trying to run macOS Mojave off a bootable external USB I'm trying to run macOS off a USB drive, so I can troubleshoot some issues I've been having with a monitor.

Have I done something wrong along the way?\n\nA: To run macOS off a USB drive, it needs to be installed on it first.\nUnlike some Linux distributions, you cannot run macOS in live mode from the bootable installer USB. Also, it appears that you are trying to install macOS onto the same USB stick that you booted off. This is clearly not possible to do.\nYou can, however, connect a separate external USB stick/drive and install macOS onto it. Once installed, remove the USB stick containing the installer, start your Mac, press and hold Option key and boot off the external disk onto which you installed macOS.\n\nA: You will need to reformat the card in the Mac, it will by default suggest GUID/HFS+.\nMost cards, as supplied, will be formatted MBR not GUID, so if you just add an HFS+ partition, the Mac cannot boot from it, no matter if you did the rest of the process correctly.\n& as Nimesh says - you cannot format the drive you are booted from [I'd missed that bit]\n", "Q: Are there any preventative measures I should employ after my MacBook was seemingly bricked?

It was not submerged in the water, it appears to be a splash type effect.\nI haven't even noticed that after arriving in my office, I was working on it as usual and suddenly noticed the power button is not working and then suddenly noticed the water stain on the protective cover.\nAs emergency solution I enabled the accessibility feature as replacement for it.\nFew hours later the button started to act like pressing itself, just few times, randomly.\nFew more hours later it started to work back as usual.\nAfter hours I went to nearest electronic repair shop which is trusted by couple of my friends. I requested them to open up my iPad and clean up the area around the power button using isopropyl alcohol to prevent corossion.\nThey refused to do it, they said it's just water and my iPad is going to be fine. Honestly, it sounds to me like they just didn't wanted to do it and gave me a bad advice. \nSome research\nAs explained in this reference, the rain water is not pure, it contains contaminants from the atmosphere and even after dried out, can cause corrosion and oxidation.\nhttp://www.circuitnet.com/experts/80616.html\nI also reviewed all the water damage related questions on this Stack and extracted relevant ones.\nAnswers that recommend cleaning at third party repair shops.

Is there anything that would prevent me from syncing iBooks with iCloud in iOS 9.3.5 on an iPad 2?\nI have a working iCloud account in good standing, with three devices connected: an iPhone SE (MP832B/A running iOS 12.3.1), a MacBook Pro (17\" Mid-2010 running 10.13.6, build 17G7024) and an iPad 2 3rd generation (MC705B/A running iOS 9.3.5 build 13G36).

I'd like to get the music off of it (I use a small mp3 player, so ideally I'd just take the music off and download it onto my own device). The problem is that it's been sitting in a box for probably around 7 or 8 years, and it's got a 'very low battery' screen and won't charge (as in, I left it for twelve hours, and no dice).\nSearching around, I was able to put it into disk mode, but the 'restore iPod' that gives you would put it back in factory mode...presumably meaning the loss of all the music on it, even though it would probably fix the device.\nWhat are my options here? Is it even possible to do what I want at this point? Thanks!\n\nA: It depends on wht you mean by \"iPod Classic.\" Which is why we recommend people include model numbers in their questions. That said there is an iPod called the iPod Classic which was the last click wheel iPod Apple sold.\nYes you might be able to get the songs off if it, depends on how much effort and $$ you are willing to expend.\nThe iPod Classic (A1238) came in a variety of HD sizes but they are all about the same for getting into. EG difficult and finicky. Once open it is possible to replace the battery. It may even be possible to extract the HD and plug it into some kind of external (USB) case if you can find one with the same connector as the HD. I think it is a non-standard connector. Other folks here will no doubt correct me on this...\nLots of places online have instructions on how to do this. YouTube is one, there are others. My favorite is iFixit.com that has instructions for replacing both the battery and HD.\nIt does not look simple but if you are adept at this sort of thing it looks like it is quite possible to do.\n", "Q: What happens if I put an unsupported version of iOS on my iPhone?

I can't imagine any use for that feature, but there it is. It's a long tedious manual process to fix all the tracks, and when I create a track stack in that project it's created at half the height of the screen, and must be manually fixed. If I enable automation on a track, I must manually resize the track header to show the automation controls, and then I must manually resize it back to normal after I hide automation. This is immensely tedious.\nIs there any way to make my project normal again?\nI've read this page, and the part that claims to address my issue is simply wrong. The UI does not work that way.\nThe shift-drag suggestion in the documentation has no effect at all. The \"Individual Track Zoom Reset for All Tracks\" Key Command sounds promising, but it does the exact opposite: It sets all of my painstakingly corrected track heights back to half the height of the screen.\nI found some practical-joke forum posts which suggested shift-double-click on the lower border of a track header. That of course sets all of my painstakingly corrected track heights back to half the height of the screen.\nAnother thing: I've had to redo volume automation several times on one particular track since this disaster befell the project. I do it, and it works for a while, and then the automation is just not there any more. When I moved the audio to a duplicate track, automation stopped working: Automation says minus infinity dB, yet I hear the track loud and clear. I don't need a fade there, so  just split the audio to work around the bug. But now it keeps turning the fader on the track to zero anyway, with no automation. Is this a known syndrome?\n\nA: The default track zoom is controlled by a little slider in the upper right corner just above the tracks area:\n\nClearly, I must have accidentally touched the mouse button while the pointer was above that slider. Once that slider is set to a sensible value, everything behaves normally, and shift-double-click on a track header border resizes all tracks to that sensible height. \nHowever, they will never behave quite normally again. A sad and inexcusable mess on the Logic team's part. \nThe automation issue must be unrelated. \n\nA: From Apple's Support document \"Zoom tracks in Logic Pro\":\n\n\n*\n\n*In Logic Pro, move the pointer to the bottom-left corner of a track. (Not a region, the track.) [notation mine]\nThe pointer changes to a pair of up- and down-pointing arrows.\n\n\n*Press and hold Shift while dragging up or down. (Or simply click to reset all tracks to same vertical height)\n\n", "Q: How can I change the icon of Recent Folder that I drag to dock on Mac I want to move the folder recent item to dock because it helps me a lot. But this is not the only one folder i use in dock, there is another one such as download folder. Because of the icon shown on these folders based on the first item in each folder, sometime it confuses me. \nThe question is, can I change the icon of those folders in dock so that I can differentiate them easily? \n\nA: I assume you mean the recents view from the side-bar: once you have this in the dock, then if you right click on the Recents \"folder\" in the dock and select the View as Folder option the Recents item will get an icon that looks like a file drawer rather than the standard folder icon–as per image below. \n\n\nA: You can easily change any icon folder from any picture you want (copy the picture you want -> get info of the folder -> click the actual picture folder -> paste the new picture).\nYou will also need to set your dock folders appear as a folder and not as a Stack : right click on the folder in the dock to pop up a list and choose make it appear as a folder and not as a stack (showing the last item you put in it).\nTo do so :\n\n*\n\n*Hold your mouse over a stack and right-click on it until a menu appears\n\n*Once that menu appears select “Display as” and choose Folder.\n\nFrom Apple support to change picture of folder :\nCreate custom icons for files or folders on Mac\nYou can create a custom icon for any file or folder using your own pictures, icons downloaded from the web, or the icon from another file or folder.\nUse your own picture or a picture from the web\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, copy the picture you want to use to the Clipboard.\nOne way to do this is to open the picture in the Preview app , choose Edit > Select All, then choose Edit > Copy.\n\n\n*Select the file or folder whose icon you want to replace, then choose File > Get Info.\n\n\n*At the top of the Info window, click the picture of the icon, then choose Edit > Paste.\n", "Q: When using a USB-C monitor with power delivery, does constantly having it plugged in damage the battery? By my assumption, the USB-C port on the monitor will charge the device even on full charge. Is this correct? I believe this would damage the battery over long periods of time.\n\nA: No, having it constantly plugged in won't damage the battery.\nThe MacBook contains power management circuitry that ensures that the battery is not \"overcharged\".\nSo having a USB-C monitor that charges your MacBook plugged in at all times is no different from having an ordinary charger plugged in at all times.\n\nA: In short, no it will not damage your MacBook. \nIt's important to note that no matter how you charge your MacBook's battery (whether that be direct via USB C or through a secondary device such as a monitor), the MacBook will be still receiving the same amount of current. This ultimately means there is no difference, and it will still have to go through the Mac's overcharge-protection circuits.\nKnowing this, we can safely say that before the power will reach the important internals, it would have gone through the proper circuitry to prevent overcharge. \nIn regards to how this circuitry works, it actually diverts the power from the battery if the Mac is on, or limits the current flow if the Mac is off.\nYou may have noticed that your MacBook gets warmer turned on connected to AC power - this is an unavoidable trait that occurs during charge. When your Mac is charging and turned on, it will be quite warm to the touch. However, you will notice that your MacBook will not be as warm when fully charged and plugged in, because the overcharge-protection is diverting the power directly to the Mac and not charging the battery. When the battery is fully charged your Mac will run directly off the AC power.\nSo, in conclusion, it's safe to assume that your MacBook will not be overcharged.  However, it is always a good idea to disconnect the power delivery or turn off the power supply occasionally. \n", "Q: Does the Mac mini (2018) support Intel Hyper-Threading? I am using a Mac mini (2018) with a 3.0GHz 6-core Intel Core i5 processor. My understanding is that this chip has 6 physical cores.\nThe Activity Monitor shows performance graphs for 6 cores.

Saving it to that location will add it to the list of scripts you can attach to folders in the Folder Actions Setup, which can be accessed when right clicking a folder in Finder, in the Services contextual menu.\n\nBefore you will be able to attach a folder action to the Trash folder, because the Trash folder is \"hidden\", you will first need to run this following AppleScript code to unhide all hidden files.\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\nkillall Finder\"\n\nAfter all is said and done, if you want to re-hide all originally hidden files, just run this following AppleScript code to hide all hidden files.\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE\nkillall Finder\"\n\nHere is a look at the Folder Action creating the text file with the names of removed files from the trash\n\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge macOS does NOT log what files were deleted so there is no way to see what was done.\nYour best bet now is to stop using your Mac until you get this issue resolved.\nWhy? Because any time you use your Mac files are written to the drive. And when you delete something the location on the hard drive that the file(s) occupied is marked as free (rather than used/occupied). So anything you save to the disk subsequently could overwrite those files, including just opening a web page. As web pages are cached (or saved to) the drive.\nIf you have a backup of those files go get them from a backup. If you don't and the files are no longer in the trash get yourself some file recovery software, install it on another Mac and put the Mac in question into target disk mode (so you are not writing anything to the disk) and look for deleted files.\n\nA: If you happen to be using Time Machine to backup your computer, you may compare your current state with one of your snapshots to list down the files that were deleted.\nBackup the current state as snapshot first so we can do a snapshot-to-snapshot comparison with the path /Users/Joe appended:\ntmutil compare \"/Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/Comp/2021-11-11-190343/Macintosh HD - Data/Users/Joe\" \"/Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/Comp/2021-11-11-174640/Macintosh HD - Data/Users/Joe/\" | grep -E ^-\n\nThe | grep -E ^- limits only to the files that were deleted in the left-hand-side (new) versus the RHS (old). The two params are the snapshot paths based on tmutil listbackups.\n", "Q: External Monitor Ghosting (MBP 2016) I tried to connect an Eizo Flexscan EV233W to My Macbook Pro using an SVGA cable (suspiciously cheap, but the only one available) and a VGA - Type C adapter.\nThe image on the external display was ghosted and low-res.\nI suspect SVGA itself is a bad choice, although I know nothing about DisplayPorts.\nOr perhaps it could be the quality of the cable?\nShould I try using my DVI cable that came with the monitor with a DVI to USB-C adapter?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Get yourself a Belkin MDP (Thunderbolt video) to HDMI adapter, and a handy HDMI cable you might have lying around, or get a Belkin all-in-one MDP > HDMI cable and it will work. I use both models at work to connect many MacBooks with Thunderbolt video ports to connect to HDMI-equipped monitors. \nAfter years of testing, my institution trusts Belkin adapters to be the most robust and applicable for the task. \nDisclaimer: I have no financial or other ties to Belkin; just a satisfied user.\n", "Q: iPad 2017 unable to restore/update I'm having issues restoring my daughter's iPad to working order, and I'm wondering what options I have.\nShe changed her passcode on it and then forgot it, so now it's permanently disabled. I'm resigned to having to wipe it (well I don't really give a shit about what she has on there anymore), but having issues getting it to a \"blank slate\".\nIt doesn't seem to be connecting to my Wi-Fi, so an over-the-air wipe from her iCloud account doesn't work.\nI've tried putting it in recovery mode by holding the power and home buttons while connected to iTunes. This initiates the update process, however after downloading the 2.9 GB update, it seems to stop with a network error -3259 and then eventually the iPad just restarts back to disabled mode.\nWhat other tricks can I try to get this back to a vanilla state so I can restore (an outdated) backup?\nI'm trying this on a Windows 10 PC on an NBN 50 Mbps connection with the latest version of iTunes.\n\nA: Download the restore image for your model of iPad from https://ipsw.me. You should be able to get the restore image for iOS 12.3.1 (current as of this writing).\nOnce you have the image, connect the iPad to your Windows PC, launch iTunes, and press and hold Shift key and click on the Update button. You'll be prompted to select a restore image. Point to the downloaded image. This should do away with the network error 3259 that you are getting.\nYour iPad would be set up from blank state. You'll have an option to restore from an iCloud backup directly over-the-air.\n", "Q: macOS could not be installed on your computer I have a Late 2011 Mac mini late 2011.

I always choose PDF when exporting and usually choose JPG when saving. Being able to change the default format from PNG to either of these would save me a few clicks every time I use Preview. Is there a way? Preview preferences has no save/export format option, and I was unable to find anything on Google.\nFor bonus points, is there a way to have the default extension for images saved in JPG format with Preview be .jpg instead of .jpeg? It's a pain to change them manually every time, and leaving them means having to remember which files are .jpg (those not from Preview) and which ones are .jpeg (those from Preview) when making websites.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Normally, Preview saves a document in whatever format the graphic image was imported. The only circumstance when a document in Preview has no pre-existing file format is when data is pasted from the clipboard.\nThere does not seem to be a known preference key for changing the default file format in Preview under this circumstance.\nFor me (on Mojave 10.14.5), Preview exports JPEG files as .jpg. \nBoth .jpg and .jpeg are valid file extensions, and there should be no difficulty in having both in a website. If you can't stand the chaos, you can easily batch process files in the Terminal with a script like this:\nfor file in *.jpeg; do mv \"$file\" \"${file%.jpeg}.jpg\"; done\n\nwhich will work on all files in the current working directory.\n", "Q: How to change the boot order of APFS volumes?

Generally speaking I manage my MAC OS X High Sierra and Mojave systems using very basic script(s) that I remotely send and apply to the entire Mac OS X system, that means all these script(s) are applied to all the users of the system.  But now I have an harder challange.  Each of my MAC OS X system has 3 user accounts. :(Admin Account) User1 (Admin Account) User2 and (Local Standard Account) User3.\nGenerally speaking if I want to send a script that only apply to the (Local Standard Account) User3 how can I do it? I was thinking with the The principle of least privilege.  I know for sure that (Local Standard Account) User3 is not an admin.  So, how can I tell at the beginning of the script to look and execute the script only to the (Local Standard Account) User3?\nOf course (Local Standard Account) User3 (username) always change.  I have more than 400 Mac OS X systems that I manage.  Instead (Admin Account) User1 (Admin Account) User2 are always the same username.\nAll my MAC OS X systems have an agent installed.  This is how I am able to execute scripts on my systems.  Every time the script run thanks to the agent, it runs as ROOT.\nLet's do an example scenario.\nI want to create a simple text file and place this text file on the desktop of 3 Mac OS X system but just inside the (Local Standard Account) User3 Desktop\nHostname: tsmith-mac\nUsername: administrator\nUsername: administrator_backup\nUsername: tsmith\nHostname: jreed-mac\nUsername: administrator\nUsername: administrator_backup\nUsername: jreed\nHostname: fmontana-mac\nUsername: administrator\nUsername: administrator_backup\nUsername: fmontana\n\nA: My understanding is that you send a script to your remote systems.  You then run the script. I'm not sure what user id the script will be run under. I don't know what you want to do for that user. \nYou could put the following header code in a script.

Currently I have Bootcamp and the HDD is split in two partitions for maxOS and Windows 10.\nI'm planning to put the SSD in the ODD bay. From what I googled around, mac cannot boot from ODD.\nI have two questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this SSD compatible with my Mac?\n\n*Is it possible to add the SSD to the ODD and install bootcamp from macOS and install Windows to SSD and then be able to boot Windows from it?\n(To clarify, macOS will remain on HDD intact and the installed Windows I already have on the other partition on the HDD)\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: I am not familiar with that particular SSD, however if it is a standard form factor 2.5\" SATA drive then it should work. This take apart on fixit.com shows replacing the HD in a 13\" 2012 MacBook Pro.\nI don't know where you heard that Macs can't boot from an optical drive but that is patently false. macOS used to come on optical media that you had to boot from to install  the OS. Also many repair utilities came on optical disks that you booted from.\nTechnically speaking it is possible to replace an optical drive with another kind of drive (SSD, HD, etc.) and there are a number of places you can find the instructions for this specific thing.\nIfixIt would be a good place to start, I think they have a kit that adapts the optical drive bay to another kind of drive. Try MacSales too. I seem to recall they carried things like this.\n\nA: You model identifier is either MacBookPro9,1 (15\" screen) or MacBookPro9,2 (13\" screen). The drive does work in your Mac as a replacement drive for the original internal drive. In other words, the drive can be found on the Kingston website for System Specific Memory for Apple MacBook Pro 15-inch (Mid 2012) and System Specific Memory for Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch (Mid 2012).\nYou are proposing replacing the ODD with this drive. However, this could lead to disappointing performance from the SSD. The maximum link speed between the ODD and logic board may be limited to 3 Gb/sec. While this would not affect using a HDD in place of the ODD, it would for a SSD which needs a 6 Gb/sec interface to maximum performance. \nSo, the typical scenario would be to replace the original HDD with a new SSD and replace the ODD with the original HDD. To put a HDD or SSD in the ODD bay, you would need an optical to SATA drive converter bracket such as the OWC Data Doubler. This website comes with the a warning which is repeated below.\n\nYou should be able to run Windows 10 from either the HDD or SSD. However, not all possible Windows configurations can be selected by using the Boot Camp Assistant. You may need to install Windows without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant. This usually is not difficult to do if you have installed High Sierra or a later version of macOS. (This is because installing these newer versions of macOS means your firmware will have received and upgrade which makes Windows easier to install.)  \n", "Q: One inch black bar on lower portion of my screen I've noticed a black line on my desktop, and I can't seems to figure out how to remove it. I've restarted my computer several times, relaunched my Finder through \"Force Quit,\" and searched through my application to remove anything I don't use anymore. I don't think it's a display card issue because I'm able to move applications behind it, and they would still appear, but just with the line in front of it. I take really good care of my laptop, so I don't think it's due to external damage. And, my cursor can move over the line. If it helps, I have a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012) and using version 10.13.6 of macOS High Sierra. If anyone could help me, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n[UPDATE: The image is a screenshot and the bar disappeared with a pixel checking program, but still there after changing the desktop picture and adjusting the display profile.]\n\n\n\nA: I suggest you to use a pixel checking program in order to identify the issue is whether related to actual hardware level dead pixel issue or a software based issue.Dead pixel checking online tool is freely available tool to check the issue. There are number of tools to find out these type of issue on the internet.\n", "Q: I spilled some milk on MacBook Pro, there is no sound what should I do? I spilled some milk on my MacBook Pro and immediately dried it, it seemed to only have been on the top and bottom. Then about 10 minutes later I played a movie and there was no sound. I then noticed a small amount of milk in the aux port so I sucked it out and turned it off and started drying it off (I turned it upside down and put it in front of my now barely warm fire place.) What should do for the sound to be normal?\n\nA: As a home remedy, you can soak your macbook in a packet of rice. it will absorb the excess water droplet in a safe manner. In that case sometime you might be able save some money without de-assembling your macbook. If any case the issue is there continuously, you better meet a technician or if you are still inside the warranty period, better do the steps adhering that.\nSoaking in a rice bucket has been experimented successfully with my xiaomi phone and my hp envy laptop (water spoiled).\n", "Q: Can I use the normal desert background image in Mojave dark mode? I like most of dark mode in Mojave, however I much prefer the light mode 'desert' image to the blue-grey one that appears in dark mode. Is there a way I can use the light mode image when I turn on dark mode?\n\nA: Yes. Also you can use the dynamic mode where the image is changing according to the clock time of the macbook. \nThe wallpaper can be change independently on top of the mode that you are working on. \n", "Q: Change the default text editor in Terminal I just discovered that Control + X + E opens a text editor in the Terminal that allows me to edit the most recent command before executing it again (I think it is actually a bash thing).\nHowever, the editor that gets opened is always Emacs. How can I change it to vim?\n\nA: This question gets to the root of how you want to work - so there's some \"preference\" that may be in play. If you come from the school of vi you might prefer a command as opposed to the emacs key bindings.\nI prefer using fc since my big chunk of time post-emacs was spent in Korn shell (ksh) and I used fc built in to summon the editor. On all macOS systems, by default vim is chosen over the emacs command.\nFor changing the editor, I usually set FCEDIT so that it catches both the bash / emacs invocation for the fc built in commands. I rarely change things, though since it's nice to know I can get directly to emacs when needed (on occasion it's better for me) and let fc do the heavy lifting for me. So if I were to head back to “emacs land”, fc is how I'd get there initially.\n\nA: Simply set the EDITOR variable to vim in your bash startup file.\nEDITOR=vim\n\nFrom the bash manual\n   edit-and-execute-command (C-xC-e)\n      Invoke an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands.

We are using Late 2015 iMac running macOS Mojave 10.14.5.\nCurrently there is a secondary Apple Display connected via a Thunderbolt Port.\nI already tried to unload kernel extension by running:\n$ sudo kextunload com.apple.iotkit.IOThunderboltFamily\n$ sudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.IOThunderboltFamily 6.8.4\n$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/IOThunderboltFamily.kext\n\nI found the right process using:\n$ kextstat -a\n\n 75    3 0xffffff7f8198f000 0xf000     0xf000     x86_64             com.apple.driver.AppleThunderboltDPAdapterFamily (5.6.4) C6AEB6E6-AFFC-355F-8073-73E21E8BC49E <65 12 6 5 3 1>\n\nEvery time I try to unload, I get the messages that there was a problem terminating the services.\n\nA: The best way to do this is to move away those kernel extensions completely. This means that they're never loaded during boot - and thus you do not have a \"gap\" where the computer is vulnerable during the time between boot and the time where you run the kextunload commands. In addition you do not have to deal with dependencies for unloading them.\nThe necessary steps are:\n1) Boot the Mac in Recovery mode (boot the Mac with cmd-R pressed). \n2) Open Terminal\n3) Disable SIP by running: \n  csrutil disable\n\n4) Create a folder to contain the disabled extensions:\n  mkdir /Users/<username>/ArchivedExtensions/\n\n5) Move the kernel extensions you want to disable away by running:\n  mv /System/Library/Extensions/<name>.kext /Users/<username>/ArchivedExtensions/\n\n6) Re-enable SIP by running:\n  csrutil enable\n\nNote that  should be substituted with your username, and  should be substituted with the extension you want to disable.

I've never owned a 1,1 or 2,1 to test.\nAs it is a Mac Pro, you have the potential of a third option - you can drop in a new drive with either a full system on it, or a bootable installer.\nIf all you need to do is reset the password, then that can be done on older OSes from Single User Mode...\nFrom MacYourself - How to reset your Mac OS X password without an installer disc\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Power on or restart your Mac.\n  \n*At the chime (or grey screen if your chime is turned off), hold down Command+S on your keyboard to enter single-user mode.\n  \n*This step is optional, but it’s a good idea because it checks the consistency of the hard disk before moving on. At the prompt, type\n  fsck -fy and press Enter/Return. Wait for the checks to complete\n  before going to the next step.\n  \n*Type mount -uw / and press Enter.\n  \n*Type launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist and\n  press Enter.\n  \n*Type ls /Users and press Enter. This lists all of the usernames on the computer – helpful if you don’t know or remember what these are.\n  \n*Type dscl . -passwd /Users/username password and replace “username” with one of the users displayed in the previous step. Replace\n  “password” with a new password of your choice. Press Enter.\n  \n*Type reboot and press Enter.\n  \n\n\nA: If you cannot boot into recovery mode or internet mode, this issue may be hard to tackle.\nBefore we start, please be sure to back up any files on your Mac. \nBack up your Mac with Time Machine\n- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250\nPlease also note that this method is not encouraged by Apple, but usually works. You may also see some effects such as loss of data or damaged OS. However, these issues do not occur often.\nTo begin, restart your Mac. When the start-up chime rings and the white screen appears, hold the Command ⌘ + S keys. This will take you to Single User Mode. Be sure to do this before the Apple Logo appears. Hold the two keys down together until a black screen appears.  You may then let go of the keys. A large number of lines of code will automatically appear on your slowly, do not do anything while this happens. \nWait until you think the commands are fully done appearing. After that, enter the commands listed below one by one. Be sure to click the Enter or Return key after each command.\nmount -uw/\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nshutdown -h\n\nThat last command should automatically shutdown your Mac. If not, proceed to shut it down manually. After your Mac shuts down, power on your Mac. Once the boot has finished loading, you should be greeted with a screen to either to choose your language of preference and continue with Mac setup or if on a macOS X Server (10.6.8), the ability to create and register a new server.

I am looking to add more RAM to my 2010 Polycarbonate unibody MacBook. It has Core 2 Duo with Nvidia 320M chipset.\nI've read that this model can run 16GB RAM (even though Apple states otherwise), and I've seen people running it with 1333MHz sticks instead of the 1066MHz ones as well. macOS reports the memory to be running at 1333MHz as well.\nNow my question is, can it run 1600MHz sticks as well? It's much easier to get those sticks nowadays.\n\nA: The people at OWC do this sort of thing on a common basis -- test to see what combinations of memory will work.\nIf I've figured your mac correctly, this page:  https://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Apple_MacBook_MacBook_Pro/Upgrade/DDR3_White \nsays that the most you can have is 2 8GB sticks.\n\nHaven't done it, so take this with a grain of salt, but most of the time using a faster stick is tolerated.  It won't run at the higher speed.\n\nThere are few cases where some odd combinations of memory work.  One instance where a mac could use a 4GB chip in the second slot, but only a 2 in the first.  I've also heard of combinations that had flakey performance  with certain size chips -- would boot, but crashed at random intervals.  I suspect that the chips drew more power than the main board could easily supply, and so were running at a marginal voltage.\n\nMore ram isn't a panacea. Fetching data from ram into cache still takes hundreds of CPU cycles.  At one point I analyzed a raft of test results spanning several years from tests on Tom's Hardware Site.  The major determinate of bench mark tests was front side bus speed -- usually a divisor of the clock speed.  This sometimes meant that under clocking the CPU could allow a lower divisor and a higher FSB.\nSome apps are greedy.  Chrome on my mac will just use whatever its available.  As I speak, Chrome is 1 G, and has 14 helpers ranging form 2 GB down to 400 MB.\nCertain apps can really use more ram.  Photoshop.  Final Cut Pro.\n\nA: I have a student who has one of those MacBooks and we upgraded the RAM to 16GB of 1066MHz DDR3 last year. A quick check on Amazon shows the price has come down to be half of what it was when she did that (~$55 for 16GB, on the US site).\nI doubt you're going to see any serious performance gains with faster RAM.  (The bottleneck is that machine's age.) And, as of now, the 1600MHz RAM looks to be as much as twice as expensive.  I personally would go the cheaper route on a 9-year-old machine, and if you haven't already done it, put the rest of the money toward an SSD or two.\nIn all of the Intel-based machines I have installed faster RAM in, the RAM will down-shift to the fastest speed the CPU & motherboard support.  If it didn't work, it was usually due to some other incompatibility, not speed.\n", "Q: How to install Windows 10 partition on macOS X Server 10.6.8 without bootcamp? I have a Mac Pro with macOS X Server 10.6.8. I want to install a Windows 10 partition without Bootcamp. Is there a way to do that?\n\nA: Installing Windows without using the Bootcamp app is risky. However, I will guide you through the correct steps to accomplish this.\nPlease Note: This method is not encouraged by Apple and may lead to your Windows OS to fail, resulting in a major loss of data.

Enterprise administrators, please download from Apple, not a locally hosted software-update server.\n  \n*When the macOS installer opens, quit it without continuing installation.\n  \n*Find the installer in your Applications folder as a single ”Install” file, such as Install macOS Mojave.\n\nThe installer is typically around 6GB in size. You can verify it by going to /Applications directory, selecting the app bundle and using Command + I keyboard shortcut to view info.\n\nAfter you have the installer available locally, you can connect an external USB drive, run the mentioned command and create a bootable installer.\n\nNote: The macOS installer can be placed anywhere on disk. Adjust the path of the createinstallmedia command accordingly to create the bootable media.\n\nA: Try checking the app Name..i had the same problem, but found out my installer was named \"Install macOS Mojave. app\" so changed it to \"Install macOS Mojave.app\"\n\nA: Alternatively to Isaac Kiptoo's answer, you can also modify the command line: \nsudo \"/Applications/Install macOS Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\" --volume /Volumes/MacOS-Stick\n\nThis accomplishes the same thing as renaming the file. [Note: I named my USB drive \"MacOS-Stick\".] The quotes allow you to retain the name of the app (with spaces) as it is shown in Finder.\nAlso, FWIW, I just used this procedure within the last hour of my posting. The format didn't take very long, but there was a 3.5-4 minute pause between the start of copying and the appearance of \"10%\", and copying was overall slower than I expected. IIRC, the entire copy process took 12-13 minutes, much slower than perhaps a straight copy of the 8.3GB in a direct copy action.

It's kind of a messy workaround though because then you have a useless contact that's just for a word. So I wouldn't be surprised if there was a better way.\n\nA: If you often dictate other items, that improves how Siri interprets your sounds.  And if you make corrections to misinterpretations, that also improves future interpretations.\n", "Q: iPhone Photos Geolocation Displayed in Wrong Language My phone language has almost always been set to English and I've always had my geolocation on for my pictures. A couple of months ago I rearranged the Preferred Language Order to bring Persian to the top, over English, to check something in an app. Then I reverted it to the previous order, English on top. \nNote that there's a difference between iPhone Language and Preferred Language Order and Persian is NOT among the supported languages for iPhone Language; I can only add it to the locale list (Preferred Language Order) and if I move it to the top, it'll adapt the locale for the apps that do support it.\nSince I did this, the Photos app switched all my previous geolocation tags to Arabic (which is the closest supported language to Persian!)\nHow can I fix this so that the names appear in English again while the phone language is set to English and those photos were taken in an English speaking country long before I'd changed the language?\n\nI've tried rebooting the phone as suggested here but that did not help. I've also completely removed Persian from the Preferred Language Order list, and nothing has changed. \n\n\nA: Months of back and forth with Apple Support, and they've been as useless as they could over the matter. Every time I've followed they've asked for a few extra screenshots and then once I've submitted them, they've gone silent and unresponsive.\nAfter spending lots of time on this, I managed to fix my problem. Here's what I tried, what did not work and what eventually worked: \nI tried switching the phone language several times to many different latin and non latin languages, and that did nothing. I also tried taking photos while the language was switched and it was saving them with the new language, but after reverting to English, those old tags were remaining in Arabic.\nSo here is what worked (and it was not so complicated to my surprise!):\nGo to Settings app > General > Reset > Reset All Settings\nNote that this doest NOT delete any media or data.

I need new batteries for my for MBP 2012 8.1 13\". I ran across a site selling what seems to be actual new Apple batteries. Is this a scam? I would like to buy a real Apple product, so how can I be sure of this?\n\nA: Some sellers offer batteries for MacBooks cheaper than Apple. If it is a well-known manufacturer or seller, I would have less to think about. However, I would order from a trusted shop. \n\nA: The only way to be sure of getting a genuine Apple replacement battery is to take your MBP to an Apple Store or other Apple-certified technician. The 13\" 2012 MBP was sold by Apple up to 2016, so it is therefore still a supported model.\nIf someone is selling something claiming to be a genuine Apple battery, then it is either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Produced at the original factory Apple used as a 'run-on' (extra copies made beyond Apple's order); or batteries that didn't pass Apple's Quality Control.\n\n*A counterfeit product made at another factory that has been set up to produce similar products, complete with Apple-branding stickers. The quality standards will be unknown.\nAs a result, the quality will be a bit of lottery. There's no way to tell whether it will work well, or whether it lose capacity quickly, or expand, or catch fire ... ;-)\nThat having been said, I've bought several batteries from Chinese factory outlets on eBay for old Unibody MBPs, and they've worked well for a number of years. \n", "Q: Move Secure Notes items from Keychain of one Mac to another?

In that scenario, additional coding will be necessary to target the specific notification.\nUpdate: After some additional testing, under macOS High Sierra, the previous paragraph may be an unnecessary statement if the result are the same under macOS Mojave. The testing revealed that if a notification is present when another one is displayed, then the latest notification displayed is placed at the top of the window list in Notification Center and is then window 1. In that case, the following example AppleScript code may work for you:\nset phone_num to \"mailxyz@mail.com\"\ndo shell script \"open facetime://\" & quoted form of phone_num\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat until (exists window 1 of application process \"Notification Center\")\n        delay 0.1\n    end repeat\n    click button \"Call\" of window 1 of application process \"Notification Center\"\nend tell\n\n\n\n*\n\n*This example code assumes in macOS Mojave when placing the call, in this manner, it only shows the Notification Center Alert with the Call button on it.\n\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

Attaching the image:\n\nI tried searching for anything with Add-in in every menu and every ribbon and still didn't get any answer.\nMS Office support didn't reply back after this and because probably even they don't know how to fix it.\n\nA: There seems to be a bug in the Outlook interface where for some users the \"Store\" button that is supposed to give you access to the add-ins doesn't show up in the ribbon.\nI have found the following method to be easy to work around it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Microsoft Word instead\n\n*Select the \"Insert\" ribbon\n\n*Click \"My Add-ins\"\nYou'll now see a list of installed add-ins as well as a link to the store.

I have this file (see attached);\n\nAnd I cannot delete it. it doesn't exist...\nI have tried typing rm in the prompt then dragging the file on to it, I have gone to the actual location of the file and it's not there, I have deleted .Trash folders left right and center and I still can't find it... I have just run First Aid on ALL the volumes I have and the file still mocks me. Does anyone else have any suggestions?\n\nA: Assuming that the file tunnelBlick.tblk is in ~/.Trash, then one sure way of deleting this file is to boot to  Recovery Mode, (⌘R when restarting the Mac), and then in Terminal (on the Utilities menu)... use the following command, e.g.:\nrm -f /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/Your_Short_Name/.Trash/tunnelBlick.tblk\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The example command above assumes the main Startup volume is Macintosh HD, change as needed.\n\n*The Your_Short_Name is that which you normally see in Finder as the name on your Home folder.\n\n\nThen type reboot and press enter to restart the Mac back to normal mode boot.\nNOTE: The rm command, especially with the -f option is potentially destructive if the target is not properly typed. Make sure the command is properly typed before executing. You can also first try without the -f option and the see if e.g.:\nls /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/Your_Short_Name/.Trash/tunnelBlick.tblk\n\nReturns anything, and is so, then use the -f option.\n\nUpdate: Based on the answer to the question I asked in the comment under your question, you would use the following command from Recovery Mode, (⌘R when restarting the Mac):\nrm -f /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/Your_Short_Name/Library/CloudStorage/iCloud\\ Drive/.Trash/tunnelBlick.tblk\n\nWith the same caveats applying:\n\n\n*\n\n*The example command above assumes the main Startup volume is Macintosh HD, change as needed.\n\n*The Your_Short_Name is that which you normally see in Finder as the name on your Home folder.\n\n\n\nNote: You can first try from normal mode:\nrm -f /Users/Your_Short_Name/Library/CloudStorage/iCloud\\ Drive/.Trash/tunnelBlick.tblk\n\nIf that doesn't work you can also try prefacing the command with sudo; however. if it will not delete from normal mode then boot to recovery mode.\n\nA: First thing I would try is running this following command in Terminal\nkillall 'Finder'\n\nThen once Finder quits, in a second or two, Finder should automatically restart.  Then try going back to empty the trash.  \nIf that does not work then I would attempt this...\nTry restarting the computer in Safe Mode.  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The Apple logo appears on your display. If you don't see\n  the Apple logo, learn what to do.\n  \n*Release the Shift key when you see the login window. If your startup disk is encrypted with FileVault, you might be asked to log in\n  twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the\n  Finder.\nTo leave safe mode, restart your Mac without pressing any keys during\n  startup.\nSafe mode (sometimes called safe boot) is a way to start up your Mac\n  so that it performs certain checks and prevents some software from\n  automatically loading or opening. Starting your Mac in safe mode does\n  the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Verifies your startup disk and attempts to repair directory issues, if needed\n  \n*Loads only required kernel extensions\n  \n*Prevents startup items and login items from opening automatically\n  \n*Disables user-installed fonts \n  \n*Deletes font caches, kernel cache, and other system cache files\n  \n\nSource: Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac\nOnce your computer has rebooted into Safe Mode, then go ahead and try to empty your trash.\n\nA: Rather than putting in the trash, try putting it into the /tmp/ folder, like so:\nmv -fv /Users/SHORT-NAME/Library/CloudStorage/iCloud\\ Drive/.Trash/tunnelBlick.tblk /tmp/ \n\nThe /tmp/ folder is cleared out on reboot, so that might do it.\n\nA: You can use rm -rf folder name with wild card(the path of the file) not in the root folder.

For the first couple of years that I had this MacBook Pro (Early 2015, 13 inch) I had a keyboard protector on it. After awhile, the protector left some pretty obvious marks on the screen from it rubbing up against the screen when laptop was closed. I eventually took it off and tried to clean the screen, but none of the regular methods have seemed to do the trick. Instead, they just spread whatever grime was on the screen over the screen more. Never really bothered me, but now I'm looking to sell this laptop and want to fix this issue so it doesn't affect the resell value.\nDoes anyone have any ideas for a solution? Has anyone else had this same problem?\n\nA: Cleaning is easy. Follow the steps Apple recommends. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172\nFor glass, that means \n\nTo clean the screen on your MacBook, MacBook Pro, or MacBook Air, first shut down the computer and unplug the power adapter. Dampen a soft, lint-free cloth with water only, then use it to clean the computer's screen.\n\nThe 3M gray microfiber cloth is a great option if you don’t have lint free cloths around. \nAnything else risks damaging the surface coating, which is what you likely have. The physical rubbing first erodes the anti glare covering and then if it continues, etches and erodes the glass itself. \nNo solvent or cloth will repair that damage, just mask it temporarily with some types of glass cleaners. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/3M-Glass-Cleaner/\nThese can damage hardware so use with sense and caution.

I am planning to reformat both of my drives in my 27 Inch iMac (mid 2011), and I have a question about the way the SSD is partitioned by Apple.\n\nWhy are there are three tiers in my SSD?\nI don't want to accidentally erase any recovery partition and don’t see an explanation of these in the Apple Support website. \nIf I am to reformat the SSD drive, should I erase at the 'Mercury Electra' level?\n\nA: The WDC WD100... and the Mercury Electra are devices. They represent the physical drives that are attached to your Mac. \nDevices contain one or more volumes. Macintosh HD is a volume on the WDC device. There will be other volumes on that device that aren't displayed. \nThe Mercury device uses Apple's new APFS format. This uses a structure called a Container to 'contain' the volumes. That's why there are 3 objects.\nIf you just want to wipe your existing volume of data, then erase Macintosh SSD and Macintosh HD. That will maintain any other existing volumes, such as Recovery partitions. \n", "Q: Finder preview: See file size and date in column view I use Finder mostly in the column view, which has a preview option.

If you have enabled full-keyboard access in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts, you can use the Tab key to move focus to the Delete button, and press Space or Enter key to invoke the Delete command.\n\nUsing the Tab key, you can move the focus to the Delete button.\n\nA: For Dialog Boxes in macOS, it usually works by using the Cmd ⌘ + first_letter, where first_letter is the first letter of the button you want to select.\n", "Q: How can I sync and store data for offline access on an iPad? I am asking a question which, despite tons of Internet research and trying out many different options, I can't seem to find a solution to. I am a software engineer by the day, and a musician at night. I recently purchased an iPad with the goal of keeping my entire sheet music library on the device. I just can't figure out how to keep the music \"synced\" on the device! Here's what I'm looking to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a folder (with subfolders) filled with music. I can share these using basically any protocol: web-dav, ssh, FTP, Dropbox, you name it. I primarily use rclone to move files around and it's easy for me to set up a server with whatever protocol makes sense.\n\n*A requirement is that the data remain on my iPad offline (don't want to depend on Internet access at a gig!)\n\n*Also a requirement is to be able to sync an entire folder, rather than selecting files individually.\n\n*My preference is to self-host my data, rather than relying on a proprietary service. If I have to use a service, I do not want to pay a monthly fee just to be able to sync. This is why Dropbox Pro doesn't work for me - I don't mind paying a hosting provider to store my data, but don't want vendor lock-in.\n\n*I don't mind paying for an app to do this.\nHow can I achieve the above? This is what I tried on the iPad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox: Would work beautifully, but I would have to subscribe to their Pro plan (in perpetuity!) and I'd rather pay monthly fees for a system without vendor lock-in.\n\n*Google Drive: You have to select individual files for offline mode, not a folder.\n\n*Nextcloud: I used to use it but found their sync to be very buggy! Maybe it has gotten better in the past 1 or 2 years.\n\n*Amazon Drive: Does not have an offline mode.\nWhat should I be trying that I haven't yet?\n\nA: I was able to use GoodReader for this. It allowed me to connect to a web-dav server that I was running, and then synchronize files as I update that directory\n", "Q: Identify if an iOS In-App Purchase is a consumable or non-consumable? I need a small help to know if what I propose in my iOS app is a consumable currency or not.\nFrom the Apple Developer In-App Purchase webpage:\n\nConsumable\nUsers can purchase different types of consumables, such as lives or gems in a game, to further their progress through an app. Consumable in-app purchases are used once, are depleted, and can be purchased again.\n\nUsers can buy a currency that has a name, such as \"bucks\", for example: 100 bucks can be bought for $1.\nUser can receive or send this currency to another user. When desired, he can convert this virtual currency to money = for example: $1 for 95 bucks.\nThis currency is like a cryptocurrency and my app is not a game.\nSo is this currency a consumable or non-consumable? I need help with understanding to prevent my app from getting rejected.\n\nA: If an item can be used once and then is not available again, it is a consumable.\nIf an item can be reused over and over, it's a non-consumable.\nThis is explained in the developer Apple's IAP overview you referenced:\n\nConsumable\nUsers can purchase different types of consumables, such as lives or gems in a game, to further their progress through an app. Consumable in-app purchases are used once, are depleted, and can be purchased again.\nNon-Consumable\nUsers can purchase non-consumable, premium features within an app. Non-consumables are purchased once and do not expire, such as additional filters in a photo app. Apple can host content associated with your non-consumable in-app purchases.\n\nBased on your comments, I would say you have a Consumable IAP.  You app could be reject for other reasons, though, so this is no guarantee that it will pass App Review. \n\nA: If your app is a currency (the value is consumed outside the app or generated / mined / calculated outside the app) then you need to worry more about section 3.1.5 Goods & Services\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#goods-and-services\nThese sections restrict outside consumables to prohibit in app purchase, and you would use ApplePay section 3.1.5(a) since this is direct trade and commerce. If your currency has any sort of investment or risk, then it’s a trading app section 3.1.5(b). \nOnly if your currency is consumed and purchased multiple times, would you have to understand if it’s consumed within the app exclusively. \nSince you are primary currency and trading, IAP isn’t going to govern your approval or rejection at all. \n", "Q: Output device changed but not getting sound output I am using macOS Mojave v10.14.5.

Running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 (18F203) and Safari 12.1.1 (14607.2.6.1.1).\n\nA: One of the very first things to try when Safari is \"behaving poorly\" is to launch it in Safe Mode.\nQuit out of Safari then just hold down ⇧ Shift while you launch it. That turns off all third party extensions and often lets you do some cleanup when you have stuff installed in Safari that is resistant to being turned off.\n\nA: Reset did not help me because I did not realise Mac restart was pending due to OS update.\nSimple Mac OS restart fixed the problem for me. As restarted installed pending OS updates.\n\nA: click on the apple icon on the top left and click force quit and click safari to force quit the safari app. Then, try what you were doing previously. \n", "Q: How can I change the circular photo on title bar of Mail.app?

The Installer app itself does not belong to any app in particular; it runs any package given, usually by double-clicking a pkg from Finder.\nInstaller will request Automation permission when a script in a package requests such, which will occur at the time of running the package. When such a request occurred, you would be installing an app on your system, hence it would be this app’s installer scripts which would trigger this.\n", "Q: How to change the Subscription plan for third party app purchased through iTunes?

Apple Support is redirecting me to Linkedin.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/topics/6156/6157/49845/canceling-a-premium-subscription-purchased-on-your-apple-device?lang=en\nHow to change the Subscription plan for third party app purchased through iTunes?\n\nA: With Apple subscriptions, you can either cancel them and let the balance play out or if it just renewed, sometimes you can undo the payment. \nApple took the money, so cancel with them. When that is sorted and you are outside the coverage of your last subscription, you will have a chance to start a new subscription type. There is no “change” lanes in my experience when one app has different tiers of subscriptions. \n\nAssuming you cancelled, perhaps there is a period when it’s still active so a chat with Apple support about your specific purchase would be the next escalation if needed. My guess is linked in might only sell basic outside the store, so they might not want to say that directly. I don’t see the words Basic, but maybe the metadata is too long to easily navigate from the in app purchase summary page. \n", "Q: Fix permissions in Apache I'm trying to use the built-in Apache server in MacOS mojave.\nIn my browser, accessing http://localhost/~myusername/mypage.html (in case of user dir) or http://localhost/mypage.html (in case of default dir) both throw the same error in the browser:\nForbidden You don't have permission to access /mysite/ on this server.\n\nI' trying to make both the default dir /Library/WebServer/Documents and an user dir ~/myusername/Sitesworks.\nI tried 2 solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried to add a vhost in /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n<VirtualHost *:80>\nServerName localhost\nDocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents/\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n*I tried to add a myusername.conf file in /etc/apache2/users with the following content\n<Directory \"/Users/myusername/Sites/\">\nOptions Indexes MultiViews\nAllowOverride All\nOrder allow,deny\nAllow from all\n</Directory>\n\nIs there a guide to understanding permission errors on Mojave using Apple shipped Apache?\nEDIT: It looks like the accepted answer here solved the reading permission for me.\nFrom the answer:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Load the module mod_userdir in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n  \n*At the end of the httpd.conf make sure to load httpd-userdir.conf\n  \n*In httpd-userdir.conf include a local file in /etc/apache2/users/<username>.conf\n  \n*Put a directory section into that file, containing the rules for the directory where your webserver files are located:\n  <Directory \"/Users/<myusername>/Sites/\">\n      AllowOverride All\n      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n      Require all granted\n  </Directory>\n\n\nWriting access to files is still a problem: Apache cannot edit a file if the ownership is mine (the admin user).

The drive is 500GB and formatted APFS.\nThe initial Time Machine backup has been running for about 24 hours and still isn't finished.\nBut it has backed up more data than could ever possibly exist on the drive:\n\nNote that it says it's backing up 683 GB (and increasing) of a 500 GB drive, when not even 200 GB of the drive has been used.\nI checked the sizes of my local snapshots, and there are only 4 of them, with the following sizes:\n\n\n*\n\n*502.2 MB\n\n*217.5 MB\n\n*5.4 MB\n\n*7.4 MB\n\n\nSo that doesn't come anywhere near explaining the difference.\nThe Time Machine drive was cleanly formatted as HFS+ right before the Time Machine backup was initiated.\nSo… why is it using so much space? How is it using so much space?\n\nA: Not exactly sure since I haven’t used TM with Mojave yet however, I may help point you in the right direction or stimulate a more accurate answer.  TM can backup all files including temp files, deleted files, cache files and even USB drives attached. If you were making a lot of changes during the initial backup, the initial file size will compensate for that. Also Mojave utilizes APFS which contains nested volumes and containers. There are additional formatting files outside of the readable HD within the volumes and containers that could be getting backed up to make sure you will be able to install from backup correctly.  It could also be backing up your recovery HD. If you run diskUtil list in terminal you can see the size of any hidden volumes and containers.  \nI wonder since APFS uses the new file reference system to save space while keeping track of duplicated and edited files, maybe that could be play a role as well. TM HD might be saving both or be adding additional reference files for the locals snapshots? In the long run, TM will be writing over the older saved backup files with newer content. So I don’t think you should pry too much to get that additional space back. \nI have had issues in the past trying to restore from a TM HD that was the same size as my primary HD and wouldn’t recommend it. Using a drive at least 2/3 times larger is the right way to go. \n", "Q: How to gift an app on the App Store for iOS? In the olden days, we could easily pay for an app for a friend to own.\nOne route for this was through the iTunes app on a Mac.

In System Preferences / Sharing I set up a shared folder on second internal drive HFS+ formatted drive for time machine backups. Backing up and entering the Time Machine backups works fine from three different clients all running 10.14.5. All backups are encrypted. On the server I can mount the sparsebundle  and read the backup (so I have the right key).\nNow I replaced one client and want to restore a backup.

That is, I skipped restoring files to the computer until I completed initializing the new drive, then upgraded the OS, and finally went back and restored applications and documents.\n\nA: Try it with AFP ON. Although AFP is deprecated, it has been shown to be more reliable with Time Machine over networks than SMB.\n\nA: Is your 'replaced client' the exact same machine name and user as before? if not, you may not have permission to access. The alternative is to take the new client an 'restore from Time Machine'  when booted from the recovery partition.

Apple sent me 4GB of updates to go to macos 10.14.5 this morning. As I have several systems needing this update, I thought I would try to save the contents of the /Library/Updates folder to use rather than allow each system to DL the 4GB of data. I was able to copy the contents to my desktop, but when trying to delete the update from /Library/Updates so that I could replace them with my copies to test my theory, I found that the system would not allow be to do so. I couldn't delete, move, or chmod the parent directory, or any of its contents. Command line returns \"Operation not permitted\". Whoami returns \"root\", but apparently not. What's up with that, any ideas?\n\nA: On one system, before you install the update - enable caching in the sharing preference pane. Save the cache files to an external drive - speed there isn’t much of a limiting factor since the downloads stream well and any recent hard drive or SSD will be almost as fast as the network can serve files.\nThen the first machine to do the download will get the file cached. All the rest of the machines will pull from the cached version.\nThis is much better than trying to stage the updates on each system as the permissions and code checks are designed to not let you easily place a file on macOS for updating.\n", "Q: With a data transfer of 50 GB estimated 5 hours, are USB-C claimed speeds inaccurate or to blame? When I bought an 2017 MBP I was under the impression (from Apple and others) that USB-C was the superfast way to transfer data. It has not worked out that way and I am wondering if I misunderstood something.\nI am downloading 50gb from the MBP to an external drive and it is showing a time of over 5+ hours left. Isn't this supposed to happen much more quickly???\n\"USB 3.1 Type-C cables offer a transfer rate of 10Gbps, which is double the transfer speed of USB 3.0 (5 Gbps)\" is what one tech site states. Can someone explain what i am missing or doing wrong?\n\n\nA: The bus speed you quote is a theoretical maximum and not that the bus somehow speeds up any and all storage connected to it.\nAn analogy would be quoting the vehicle capacity of a 10 lane highway that’s perfectly packed with cars, all of which drive themselves bumper to bumper in perfect coordination. With good buffering, ideal behavior, no hiccups you can hit the benchmark “specs” on the nose every time. \nIn practice, there are lane changes, no cars waiting to enter the traffic pattern, or just everyone driving in the left lane. (Let alone spiking the breaks or cutting others off ...)\nBack to computers, my advice is to open the Activity Monitor app and look at the Disk tab. Specifically the IOPS and data rates are different constraints. \n\nIO is like getting all the vehicles on and off the highway so you’ll have low transfer rates when there are lots of small delays and metadata being read from slow storage. That's on the left side and in the chart when IO is selected.\nYour graph shows an IO constrained transfer, the system is spending more time locating the next group of bits to transfer, it can’t likely fill up the max transfer of the drive. Most consumer drives can absorb 20 MBps to 60 MBps and most Macs can put out hundreds and NVMe ssd on recent Macs thousands of MBps and IOps. \nBandwidth is another constraint similar to the on ramps and off ramps - your sending and receiving device might be the bottleneck. That's the data read/sec on the right and shown above.\nWithout any specific data measurements, hopefully the high level description of what to look for and how to think of the bus speed helps you sort out if you brought too fast an expectation to devices that can’t deliver or if everything is capable of fast transfers and you have a configuration / software / hardware issue in hand to diagnose and optimize.\nMy hunch is the speed estimate is conservative, Finder is single threading the transfer and your bottleneck is a consumer grade external drive (HDD or slower flash storage) and you'd be able to get 60% of the max with a more efficient transfer and a fast Thunderbolt 3 type storage device attached: https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2019/06/thunderbolt-3-enclosures-with-single-dual-quad-m-2-nvme-ssds-for-esxi.html\n\nA: It's your data\nThat variability of data rate suggests a copy of many smallish files - akin to backing up the OS files, for instance, where a typical file is as small as 30 bytes and often in the 5-100kb range. \nEvery file has some \"write\" overhead that must be done per file, regardless of the file size, such as writing the directories.  And this isn't a big block transfer; it involves the physical drive hunting all over the disk, which means you're doing a lot of waiting for head traverse and for the right sector to come around.  \nOnce you get into big files, like your videos, you will be doing steady block transfers and should start seeing much more impressive rates, certainly at least 30MB/sec.  Still a far cry from USB's nameplate speed, but the limiting factor is still this physical hard drive, and a basic consumer-tier one at that.  \nOnce, I tried to unzip a ZIP file with about 5 million rather small files on it.  At the rate it was going, it was going to take over a day.   So, I created a RAMdisk.  It unzipped in 5 minutes.   Seek time matters! \n\nA: There are many possible answers, but before I offer them - Have you actually tried to go on and start the copying process? The initial estimate is - well - just an estimate, and after the first few megabytes, it may jump down to something more appealing. \nNow - the time it takes to copy 50GB from one drive to another, is not only bound by the hardware data-transfer rate of the bus (in your case, 10GBPS or little over 1 Gigabyte a second).\nIt strongly depends on the read speed of your source drive and the write speed of your target drive - if your external drive is a mechanical HDD - it won't be able to sustain writing data at the theoretical USB-C 3.1 rate. \nThen - it also depend heavily on the data you try to copy. Is is just one large file? maybe a directory hierarchy containing millions of small files? something in between? \nWhen copying complicated file-system subsets (directory hierarchies) from one drive to another, For one, scanning the source directory and its descendents is a process that takes time. But also creating a complicated directory structure on the target drive takes lots of time too - regardless of the size of their contents. \nIn your case, I believe it is just your external hard drive. It may be a slower HDD, or it won't support the faster connection variant. \nLast, but not least - faulty or poor-quality cables sometimes cause very-slow file transfers - and in some cases, these cables can create corrupt copies of the original data on the target. So check with another cable too.\nLast -Even with a slow HDD connected via old 480MBPS USB cable, I was able to copy a full hard-drive (512GB) in just under 45 minutes - so the whole thing can simply be a hardware/cabling issue.\n", "Q: rails error on macos mojave 10.14.5: config/load_config.rb:5:in `require': cannot load such file -- configurate (LoadError) Im trying to install ruby and rails on macos using rbenv.\nOn running rails new myapp and rails -v\nit gives error: \n5: from bin/rails:8:in `<main>'\n4: from bin/rails:8:in `require_relative'\n3: from /Users/jagtarsingh/config/boot.rb:8:in `<top (required)>'\n2: from /Users/jagtarsingh/config/boot.rb:8:in `require_relative'\n1: from /Users/jagtarsingh/config/load_config.rb:5:in `<top (required)>'/Users/jagtarsingh/config/load_config.rb:5:in `require': cannot load such file -- configurate (LoadError)\n\nIm following these sources\nhttp://guides.railsgirls.com/install#setup-for-os-x\nhttps://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.14-mojave\nI don't have a good search term that can help me figure out this error. Where might I start to research or diagnose this?\n\nA: That guide is very polished and super close to getting you an install, but I fear it isn't sufficient to get rails running.\nThe two things I've been able to reproduce is the rbenv isn't calling the proper version of gem to get rails installed and even after you rehash things, rails is still being called from /usr/bin and not where homebrew and rbenv are stashing the non-system version of these tools.\nTo check which location in your PATH the key tools are being called:\nwhich ruby gem rails rbenv\n\nOn a clean system, you would see this:\n$ which ruby gem rails rbenv\n/usr/bin/ruby\n/usr/bin/gem\n/usr/bin/rails\n\nAfter following that instructions, your gem is still not calling the /usr/local version so you're installing rails against the system framework and not the intended one.

I have heard that webmail services (even the one with E2EE) are prone to JavaScript based attacks, while native apps like Mail.app in macOS are secure against such attacks.\nIs this true? Is it better to use Mail.app than using webmail?\n\nA: In practice no Mail.app is not more secure.\nThe reason being that most mail providers also provide a webmail service e.g. Gmail, iCloud, Outlook.\nSo you have the risks of webmail as well as possibly other from Apple Mail. the attacks against Apple Mail are different.\nRe Javascript attacks I use webmail and don't allow download of images and use web blockers to stop various Javascript from running. Mail.app will run Javascript (the message pane is in effect a web browser)\nNow if you could find a mail provider that does not provide webmail access then there might be something in the original premise. However there will be other security issues and so you can't say one is more secure than the other.\nIn all cases turn javascript off if you can if you are worried about security. There is a good case for using text based mail user agents like pine, mutt, even emacs, however the mail might not be as friendly and as easy to use.\nRemember security is relative.

In the phone case is a card that supports contactless payments. When using the phone case (containing both a phone and card) the phone seems to always have preference over the cards.\nThis seems to be a known behaviour.\nBut I was wondering if there is some technical background for this, or could it be that the phone when enables the NFC takes over the cards due to strong signal, etc?\n\nA: It's called card clash & is a very real issue.\nIf you carry more than one NFC device in the same container, you don't know which one is going to pay. Most payment devices I've seen in London, UK[1] will detect 'more than one card' & refuse to proceed until you offer up a single card, but you don't know if that will be true for all payment devices. There is a definite possibility of paying twice in some circumstances.\nFor an iPhone with Apple Pay then nominally, unless you were actively triggering it with Touch or Face ID, simply offering up a wallet wouldn't trigger Apple Pay.[2]\nIf you are intentionally triggering Apple Pay but have another NFC card in close proximity, then you really don't know which will actually pay.\nThe current advice is simply to never keep multiple NFC devices in the same container, or take out the single device/card to offer up to the machine. It's the only way to be certain.\n\n[1]The entire public transportation system in London is powered by NFC cards. You can't get on a bus with any other method, no cash, no tickets. Trains & the tube you can pre-pay & get a magnetic strip paper ticket [pretty much a tourist-only structure], but the barriers are otherwise entirely contactless.\nThat means more than 30 million journeys per day have to be handled seamlessly - which is why the 'clash detectors' are pretty good on TfL.\nConversely, some small retail devices are known to take both payments on occasion - our local pub has had to remove their contactless system recently, until they can install a better system, for precisely that reason.\n[2] Late addition 2022\nSince first writing this answer you can now set TfL Apple Pay to be 'ID-less' so it doesn't require your Face or Touch ID to use the transport system.

If someone please has a smart solution to this mess I would be extremely thankful!\nPlease\nThanks for reading. \nIn regard of the comment claiming this to be a duplicate of another question:\nIt's true, they are similar and the presented solution under the other question is awesome, but I need a solution that works today and not within the next 7 days, as it is mentioned by the service provided by apple. \n\nA: Select a photo, go to another, far away photo, hold Shift and select another. It should download more photos at a time. \nThis is not a comprehensive solution to such a situation. Just because questioner can select 40-50 photos in browser, I am suggesting a way to select more.\nI recommend Firefox for such download. It comes from experience of Firefox Send. Safari gets stuck in bigger downloads.\n", "Q: How to stop macOS updates from taking over the rEFInd boot manager? I have rEFInd installed on the EFI partition of my 2015 MacBook Air. Every time I update macOS, it ends up taking over the bootloader and resetting it to using the macOS operating system. Afterwards, if I hold the option key while booting up my mac, there is no boot option for rEFInd that I can select. The only way I can bring rEFInd back is to boot up into recovery mode, manually mount my system partition with Disk Utility (as it is encrypted using FileVault), then open Terminal and reinstall rEFInd. It's quite a hassle.\nIs there any better way to handle macOS updates?\nI have read the section of the rEFInd manual named \"Recovering from a Coup Using MacOS\" but I didn't find any information in there that was pertinent to my situation. Note that I cannot disable System Integrity Protection (which one of the solutions there requires) as I need to keep it enabled for the software development I do on this system.\nBelow is the output from the command diskutil list disk0.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         121.1 GB   disk0s2\n\nI have Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.15 beta installed to an external drive, so my MacBook's internal drive just has macOS.\n\nA: By default, rEFInd is installed in the EFI partition.

I have used a software named TransMac to make a installation USB in windows following the steps in the link below:\nI used this link\nBut the provided USB drive after all these steps doesn't show up in my MacBook pro. Considering that I have saved Install macOS Mojave.app on my external hard drive, and I don't have access to any other Mac computers, How can I fix this issue and build a USB for installing Mojave?\n\nA: It is generally not possible to create a macOS bootable installer using Windows or Linux computer.\nYou can consider installing macOS via Internet Recovery.\n\nA: There is no way to create Mojave USB installer on Windows with the app installer downloaded from Mac App Store. You have to download Mojave dmg file and burn it to USB. Unfortunately, there are only two Windows app that works in this way. One is TransMac and the other is UUByte DMG editor.\nFor those, who failed with TransMac, UUByte DMG Editor is good to go. The steps are much simpler than TransMac.

My wife's iPad is constantly out of space. Most of the space is used up by Messages, where her iPhone Messages sync with iCloud, and her iPad sync with iCloud, and thus, she copies all those large attachments to to iPad and fills up her space.\nI found this article that talks about enabling the \"Auto Delete Old Conversion\" feature. However, before I do this, will enabling this feature on her iPad also delete messages on her iPhone and Mac as well since she is using iCloud Messages? She wants to keep all her messages on her iPhone/Mac since she has ample storage there.\n\nA: You can consider disabling Messages altogether by going to Settings app → Messages → iMessage. This will completely disable Messages on the iPad (you won't be able to send/receive Messages).\nDisabling Messages on one device doesn't affect in any way on other devices linked to the same Apple ID.\nHowever, simply turning off Messages may not automatically purge the message cache.\n\nA: I’ll delete this later or edit it into a direct answer (or maybe a how to if Apple doesn’t have a step by step guide to this)\nWhat are the recommendations and storage constraints for this iPad specifically?\n\nNote that the darker grey is still being checked and cataloged, so you want to let iOS take several minutes to run the various sizing checks if you are really low on space. \n", "Q: How do I easily delete characters in a TextEdit document which I did not type?

Nothing has ever worked and I've been on the brink of just giving up and getting a new computer that works consistently but I took a final stab at trying to diagnose myself.\nThrough careful monitoring and note taking, I've found that it only happens when anything is plugged into either of the two Thunderbolt ports. I personally have tried a few different external hard-rives on a firewire to Thunderbolt adapter and also a Thunderbolt recording sound card. What I've found is that I can create a positive kernel task overload by only plugging in the bare cables with no actual device on the other end, even connecting only the adapters by themselves creates an overload. My audio sound card is a straight Thunderbolt 1 cable connection (no adapters) and this also creates the overload.\nThis follows with countless people I've read who have the kernel task issue using Thunderbolt displays and Thunderbolt ethernet adapters. And it seems that everyone is addressing their particular devices when it seems to be the Thunderbolt ports as a whole, which I actually haven't seen addressed anywhere so I'm starting it here.\nIf anyone has been struggling with this issue, keep an eye on your Activity Monitor while alternating devices and cables into your Thunderbolt ports.   I'm not sure if its important to note that kernel task overloads are mostly, but not always, showing as the actual kernel_task process itself in Activity Monitor, sometimes any random program that I have open such as a Web browser or DJ program will hover to 500% usage until everything is disconnected from Thunderbolt instead.\nI would love to find a real solution. I've never had any physical damage to my MacBook Pro, but would replacing the logic board or any other board fix this?\n\nA: I've actually had the same issue forever with my mac. The same device as yours.\nI took it in to get fixed just before my 3 year warranty expired and unfortunately I thought it was fixed, but it wasn't. (Very regrettable that I didn't notice it wasn't resolved till after the extra 90 day warranty had expired.) \nI honestly think it's a defect in the device, but have no idea how to fix it. I've tried many solutions over the years and just found your post as I'm restarting my search.\nIt is so frustrating to not be able to use the second monitor I have sitting here.\nNot a solution, but one thing that helps a little with the kernel overload is running an actual fan across the surface of your computer.\nIf you've come up with anything, please do share.\n", "Q: Can't download macOS High Sierra once again I've macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G8023) installed.

I challenge myself every month. This month I pushed myself a little harder and decided to aim for perfect month award.

Voila!! I gained additional 3 hours for the day, I closed my move ring with that one calorie I needed the most to get my perfect month award.\nBut you need to wait until 00:00 AM to change back your time zone. I tried to change back my time zone immediately after closing the ring but my watch got confused. So, I left my watch on charging and changed my time zone the next morning.\nYay!! I got my first perfect month award.\nI seriously will not suggest anyone to do this on a regular basis. We need to be true to ourselves to achieve our goals. I was desperate for the perfect month award, I worked hard all month long for it and did not want to lose it by just 1 calorie.\n\nA: You could change the date of your iPhone/Apple Watch to that day and then burn 2 calories with an activity of your choosing.

I just miss my goal after trying once with the original watch to dial back the goal one day I didn’t think I could make it.\nFor completionists, the watch follows time zone changes so you can both adjust your goal for today and then extend “today” at the expense of the following one in many cases if you are careful about managing time zones changes.\n\nA: You can always go on the Health app on your iPhone.

Not all software supports it however.\nAlso be aware that the usage of legacy terminals is very, very low.

I'm looking for a way to disable auto-save in Preview (only).\nBackground: \nIn OS X Lion, Apple introduced the concept of Auto-saving, Versioning and Restore (or Persistence, in which an application would reload the documents it previously had opened).\nThis works well for certain types of application, e.g. document-creation apps, but not for Preview, where users might not want to modify original images and PDFs, but rather to make changes to copies. It can also be easy to make accidental edits, immediately over-writing the original.\nIt used to be possible to prevent auto-save in Preview with the following Terminal command:\ndefaults write -app Preview ApplePersistence -bool no\n\nHowever, this no longer seems to work, notably because Apple changed the default preference for all apps to close windows at Quit, instead of persisting on relaunch. Apple also seems to have split Auto-save and Persistence as two separate options, whereas previously they were intertwined.\nI can of course set System Preferences > General to Ask to Keep Changes when Closing a Document. This works, but disables Auto-save on all applications. Checking this preference sets NSCloseAlwaysConfirmsChange in .GlobalPreferences from false to true. However, trying this key-value pair in Preview's own plist doesn't set the behaviour just for Preview.\nIn short: I'm asking if anyone knows a method which might disable auto-save only in Preview, without my having to lock all my original image files.\nI guess it may be that I have to use some other image viewer and editor, though there aren't many that fill Preview's shoes, because Preview already exists.

You can uninstall MathType and it will continue to work, or has for me at least.\n", "Q: Compile for iOS 5.1 in macOS Mojave I have a macOS Mojave based Mac, and, for a project, I need to be able to target iOS 5.1 (iPad 1).\nXcode 10 doesn't ship build support for iOS 5.1, so I downloaded Xcode 4.3 from Apple's archives.\nXcode 4.3 isn't compatible with macOS Mojave, and from what I've been able to understand, it is with OS X Mountain Lion.\nWithout having to buy an old Mac (old enough to be based on OS X Mountain Lion), and without having to completely reinstall the OS, how can I compile for the iOS target 5.1, for an iPad 1?\n\nA: The latest Xcode version that is documented by Apple to include the iOS 5 SDK is Xcode 4.3.3 for Lion. Apple doesn't document in the release notes whether it is also included in Xcode 4.4 and Xcode 4.4.1. However, by Xcode 4.5 it is definitely not included anymore.\nThe important thing to notice here is that you actually do not need to have the iOS 5 SDK in order to build an app for iOS 5. This means that you can build apps for iOS 5 with an Xcode that is newer, and doesn't as such include the iOS 5 SDK.\nYou do this by setting the deployment target of your project. Inside Xcode you click on your project (the blueprint icon), select the Info tab and then you have a drop-down named \"iOS Deployment Target\". You'll want to set it to 5.1.\nWith modern Xcode releases, you can download simulators, etc. directly from within the latest Xcode - however this only goes back to iOS 8 for Xcode 10. This also goes for the deployment target.\nThe end result is that you can use a much newer Xcode than Xcode 4.3, although not the latest Xcode 10 releases. You just need to remember to set your deployment target for the project!\n\nA: Honestly, your best bet is to find a used Mac that can run Mountain Lion. It would likely be cheaper in time and $$ to go that route. The most recent Macs that can do that are 2007, 2008, 2009 models. I found a number of these systems on eBay for way under $100 bucks.\nFailing that you might be able to get one of the virtualization packages (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels) to run that version of macOS.\n I believe that virtualizing macOS on macOS is not something that is officially supported by any of the vendors who make that software but There are guides out there that may be able to help you virtualize macOS ON macOS with your virtualization platform of choice.\n", "Q: SUMIFS with comparisons to relative cells (This is somewhat similar to How do I reference a cell from within a \"...IF\"-type function condition string? and SUMIF statement with two different conditions (Text based and checkbox))\nI have a formula on one sheet like the following:\n=SUMIFS($Amount,$Date,\">=01/01/2017\",$Date,\"<02/01/2017\",$Key,\"=IN:ALI*\")\n\nWhere $Amount, $Date, and $Key reference specific columns on another sheet in the same file.\nThis works (yay)\nUnfortunately, I have to copy and edit the formula for each column (and across all rows, since each row has a different string at the end as part of the condition). I want to make it easier to copy/paste this formula across multiple columns on the first sheet such that I'd get something like:\ncolumn-A: =SUMIFS($Amount,$Date,\">=01/01/2017\",$Date,\"<02/01/2017\",$Key,\"=IN:ALI*\")\ncolumn-B: =SUMIFS($Amount,$Date,\">=02/01/2017\",$Date,\"<03/01/2017\",$Key,\"=IN:ALI*\")\n...\ncolumn-K: =SUMIFS($Amount,$Date,\">=11/01/2017\",$Date,\"<12/01/2017\",$Key,\"=IN:ALI*\")\n...\n\nSo, I added a row so that near the top of each column (below headers / before data) I entered dates, e.g.:\nA3: 01/01/2017\nB3: 02/01/2017\n...\n\nThe plan being to replace the hard-coded strings in my formula with cell refrences (e.g.: A$3, B$3, etc.), but I cannot seem to figure out a way to plug them into the formula in a manner that will allow them to update automatically/correctly when pasted into subsequent columns.\nI tried \">=A$3\" and \"<B$3\" - but the 'A' and 'B' don't get updated when the formula is copied from cell A4 to B4.\nI tried \">=\", A$3 ... \"<\", B$3 - but I get a syntax error.\nI tried \">=\" A$3 ... \"<\" B$3 - but that too gets a syntax error\nIs there a way to do this?\n(note: If I put all the formulas into a text-editor to do query-replaces on the date strings, I still have to click into each cell to paste them, otherwise the formulas end up as text-strings rather than formulas - if there's a good way around that I'd like to know too)\nAfter various Q&A's and design morphing, this ended up as: AppleScript Numbers: Process data from Quicken\n", "Q: How do I transfer a note with 6+ images from an iPhone to a Mac? I take notes on my phone (text, to-do lists), take photos from within the notes (click (+) and \"Take Photo or Video\"), and then need to merge those notes into a larger report on my laptop. I am creating the notes with the Notes app on an iPhone 7 Plus (iOS 12.3.1) and trying to transfer these to a MacBook Pro (Mojave 10.14.5). When these notes have six or more images I am unable to transfer.\nI have tried the following three options:\n1. AirDrop, the ideal solution, and why it doesn't work\nAirDrop worked fine regardless of how many images in a note as of at least December 2018. Now, AirDrop only works if the note has 5 or fewer images. That notes with fewer than 5 images work, shows that connectivity and settings are not issues. \nHowever, trying to AirDrop a note with 6+ images always fails. I attempt to share the note, click the icon for my laptop under AirDrop, and it almost immediately says \"Failed\" and my laptop receives no notice to accept or decline.\n2. Create PDF, an okay option, and why it doesn't work\nConverting the note, complete with images, to a PDF and then transferring the PDF via AirDrop should theoretically work. \nHowever, if the note has 4 or more images, the share icon -> \"Create PDF\" option brings up a mostly blank screen that says \"Unsupported file format data.\" Click \"Done\", \"Delete PDF\", and try the share icon -> \"Create PDF\" option again and the Notes app crashes and disappears.\n3. Collaborate on the note, a good option, and why it doesn't work\nTheoretically, you can add people to the note to work on it collaboratively. \nHowever, if I share the note from my phone iCloud account with my laptop iCloud account (they are different), it sends an email or message with an invitation that must be accepted in order to see the note on the laptop. I have MFA enabled on my iCloud accounts and accepting invitations does not appear compatible with MFA. I click the invitation link and I successfully authenticate through MFA. Apple.com shows a blank screen and the invitation is not accepted (back on my phone I can see the status is \"invited\" still). Various browsers and restarts and clearing cookies and relogging into iCloud on all devices and many refreshes and it still just gives me a blank page.\n(The official Apple Support Community does not work with MFA either it appears.)\nMy question:\nHow do I transfer a note with 6+ images from my iPhone to my Mac?\n\nA: duplicate the note as many times needed.\nerase photos in the duplicate notes so that there are 5 or less of them  pic 1 to 5 in the first note, pic 6 to 11 in the second - and so on ...\nairdrop them to the computer - assemble the notes in one (or put in a folder) on the computer.\n", "Q: a bug in \"pbcopy\" using \"system()\" call am losing my hair over this. when using the\"pbcopy\" in c++ using the system call it doesn't work with foreign languages unless its run in admin using sudo ???\nsystem(\"echo привиет как дела\") - works output : привиет как дела\nsystem(\"echo test123 | pbcopy\") - works, output to clipboard: test123\nsystem(\"echo привиет как дела | pbcopy\") - does not work, output to clipboard: –ø—Ä–∏–≤–∏–µ—Ç –∫–∞–∫ –¥–µ–ª–∞ \nsystem(\"echo привиет как дела | pbcopy\") - using sudo to run the c++ app works, output to clipboard: привиет как дела\n\nplease help me out i don't want to use objective C NSPasteboard\n\nA: Essentially what happens is that when you run that echo command without sudo, your locale settings are set to the wrong language and character set (because of your environment variables) - and when you run it with sudo, this is corrected because it then evaluates the environment of the sudo'ed user so that the character is set correct (probably to UTF-8).\nThis is exactly similar to what happens if you used a computer with macOS set to an English locale and input settings, and then tried to run such a command (for example from a downloaded script). Because the character set is different it would work differently.\nI see the same thing often here in Denmark with conflicts over ISO-8859-1 versus UTF-8 (although UTF-8 is becoming more and more ubiquitous). If the character sets do not match, the local characters (i.e. åæø ÅÆØ) becomes garbled after piping into commands such as pbcopy.\nIn order to avoid this, tweak your command like this when you run it in Terminal or from a program:\necho привиет как дела | LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbcopy\n\nSetting the character set to UTF-8 means that a very wide range of characters are supported, and it matches the character set you've probably set Terminal.app to.\n", "Q: stdlib.h file not found and macOS SDK package installer also not found I have macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (For various reason I will not update)\nand Xcode 10.1 installed alongside command-line-tools.\nI am trying to compile a certain software that is attempting to open the following header file:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include/c++/v1/stdlib.h\n\nbut it cannot find the file.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.\nI am using a baseline 2019 15\" MacBook Pro. I understand that many variables can affect download speed, but I was posting here in case this was a problem that people had faced before.\n\nA: Your Internet connection speed alone doesn't determine the download speed that you will get when fetching a file from a remote site. You Internet bandwidth determines the maximum speed that you get when transferring content from a remote computer.\nThe remote computer (download host) may also have upload bandwidth restrictions due to variety of reasons. The upload speed of the remote computer in-effect considered in addition with your download speed determines the transfer speed you get.\nIt appears that the site you are trying to download data from have such restriction in place. To alleviate, try using an alternate download mechanism available on the site, via a different protocol or a download mirror.\n\nTo verify if you are receiving speed advertised by your ISP in the installed Web Browsers, you can simply check with one of the Internet speed testing websites.\n", "Q: Why would port 19421 be open on an iPhone?

Everything runs beautifully save one problem...if I install graphics drivers - any at all - the computer crashes like crazy.\nI've searched innumerable websites for some kind of solution, downloaded various different versions of drivers (including betas), booted into safe mode, and tried a clean boot - but nothing I've tried resolves the issue.\nPerhaps the graphics card is just fried and I don't know it (and I'm too much of a perplexed coward to actually remove it), but the Windows side is working better than the Mac side, because booting into OS X causes the iMac to crash within 10 seconds no matter what I do; at least on the Windows side, the computer will survive even though it has no drivers installed.  Too bad that using the integrated graphics in Windows isn't an option.\nCan anyone suggest other options for me to troubleshoot this?\n\nA: this is Gidoza (original poster) I'm just responding from elsewhere so don't mind the name change.  :)\nI have Mac OSX El Capitan - it originally worked fine, and I installed Windows 7 x64 through that.  I used the standard BootCamp software that could be downloaded for this brand of computer, the latest version...I don't recall which one that is though.\nSorry, but I don't know what a BIOS or an EFI is.\n", "Q: Multiple Apple devices/One Bluetooth speaker I have my iPhone synced to a Bose bluetooth speaker.  I would like to sync my MacBook Pro to the same speaker.  When I open \"Bluetooth\" on the Mac, there are no options to add another device, and I'm getting a spinning wheel.  I have just restarted the Mac, but that didn't help.  How do I do this?\n\nA: Press the bluetooth button for a while on the Bose speaker to let it become available for pairing, then it will appear in the bluetooth folder of your Mac.\n", "Q: Use independent scanner and printer as one (specifically for photocopy) I have a Canon Lide 110 (scanner) and an Epson L120 (printer) which I want to combine to achieve the feature set of an off the shelf all-in-one printer-scanner.

My Mac mini (2018) has a speaker that works well for playing music and making user interface sound effects. But I do not hear a startup chime when booting the machine. \nIn other words, I have the exact opposite problem of this Question, Mac Mini: No sound except for startup chime\nIs there a way to restore the traditional startup sound?\n\nA: Apple has removed the startup chime from all the Mac models starting from Late 2016.\n\n\n*\n\n*About Mac startup tones\n\nMac models from early 2016 and earlier make a chime sound when they start up. Mac models from late 2016 and newer don't have a startup chime, with the exception of MacBook Air (13-inch, 2017).\n\n\nA: See this TidBITS article.\nBasically, on some systems, you can re-enable the startup chime with this Terminal command:\nsudo nvram BootAudio=%01\n\nOn later systems, this might work:\nsudo nvram StartupMute=%00\n\n", "Q: Macpro two drives Triple UEFI Boot move from Grub2 to \"headless\" bootmanager rEFInd issues Thanks @David Anderson for the huge afford to instruct people like me for make tools more efficient. I have been very happy with my triple boot mac via Grub2 a long period of time since Adobe have issues with my GT120 i lost my Bootscreen. Now i struggle with the new workaround with (silent)refind. \nI don't get the hint with the scripts installed within the Dock (macOS/Ubuntu/Win10) \nCan i boot my UEFI install of Win10 and Ubuntu on a second SSD drive with it?!\nMy setup: cMP5,1 macOS High Sierra / Bootrom 140 / Boot:SM951 in a IO-Crest PCIe / Win10 & Ubuntu on a second SSD / Vega 56 graphics\nThanks in advance\n\nA: The original assumption was rEFInd would be installed in a small FAT formatted partition. This had the advantage that macOS, Windows and Linux could read and write to the volume. Recently, I added the option for rEFInd to reside in an EFI partition. This required modifying the Startup application to include an option for mounting and unmounting volumes.\nOne can define menuentry options in the refind.conf file. The default menuentry to boot can be selected by using the default_selection option. The refind.conf file can also contain a include option to read options from another file. For example, the option given below would read options from the default_os.conf file in the rEFInd tools folder.\ninclude \\EFI\\tools\\default_os.conf\n\nThe Startup application assumes the default_os.conf file contains default_selection options where zero to one option is not comment out. For example, the file could contain the following lines.\n#default_selection \"macOS High Sierra\"\ndefault_selection \"Windows 10\"\n#default_selection \"Ubuntu 18\"\n#default_selection \"High Sierra on USB3\"\n#xdefault_selection \"Fedora 18\"\n\nHere \"Windows 10\" would be the operating system that rEFInd would boot by default. The Startup application can change which default_selection options are commented out.\nIf you were to select High Sierra on USB3 as shown below, the the default_os.conf file  would change to what is shown below.\n\n#default_selection \"macOS High Sierra\"\n#default_selection \"Windows 10\"\n#default_selection \"Ubuntu 18\"\ndefault_selection \"High Sierra on USB3\"\n#xdefault_selection \"Fedora 18\"\n\nIf you were to select Use Previous as shown below, then the default_os.conf file  would change to what is shown below. Basically, rEFInd would now boot to which ever operating system was chosen last from rEFInd's menu. In your case, you probably would configure the Startup application to omit this choice.\n\n#default_selection \"macOS High Sierra\"\n#default_selection \"Windows 10\"\n#default_selection \"Ubuntu 18\"\n#default_selection \"High Sierra on USB3\"\n#xdefault_selection \"Fedora 18\"\n\nStartup Application User Configurable Options\nBeing that you have the source, you can actually make any changes you like. However, the top of the script contains a few common items one would wish to configure.\n\n\n*\n\n*Path an name of the file containing the default_selection options.\nset inputFile to \"/Volumes/REFIND/EFI/tools/default_os.conf\"\n\n\n*An optional device to mount. If you do not need to mount any volumes, then leave the string empty. For example, to mount the default EFI partition, you would make the following change.\nset deviceToMount to \"/dev/disk0s1\"\n\n\n*If you need to enter a password before mounting a volume, then make the following change.\nset mountAsSuperuser to true\n\n\n*To omit Use Previous from the list of choices, you would need to make the change shown below.\nset allowPrevious to false\n\nDownloading the Startup Application\nThe Startup Application can be obtained by downloading the Startup.app.zip file. Basically, click on the green Download button on this webpage. This application was creating using macOS 10.13.16 (High Sierra) and the Script Editor application Version 2.10 (194) for AppleScript 2.7. You will need to enter the following command to remove the quarantine. Here I assume you download to your Downloads folder. \nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Startup.app\n\nIf you are using an older version of macOS, then you may need to build the application. The steps are outlined in the next section.\nSteps to Build the Startup Application\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Startup.applescript and rEFInd.icns from this SourceForge website.\n\n*Open Startup.applescript in Script Editor application.\n\n*From the Script Editor menu bar select File->New.\n\n*Copy the entire contents of Startup.applescript to the new window.\n\n*From the Script Editor menu bar, select File->Save. Choose the Application file format, then set save as to Startup.app.\n\n*From the Finder application, right click on Startup.app and select Get Info.\n\n*Drag the icon representing rEFInd.icns onto the icon in the upper left corner of the Startup.app Info window, as shown below.\n \n\n*The result should be the Startup.app icon be changed to the image shown below.\n\nFinally Note\nThere also is a GUI PowerShell version for Windows and a GUI Python 3 version for Ubuntu (and perhaps other versions of Linux). A CLI version written in Bash 3 exists for operating systems with no graphical interface.\n", "Q: How to md5 a list of filepaths contained in a file? I have a folder containing many folders containing many files.

In the specific case the MD5 calculation takes so much time that other factors most probably can be ignored. \nPS: Tip of the hat to @lhf for reminding me of -r\n", "Q: Why is Adobe Lightroom 6 incompatible with the upcoming macOS 10.15 (Catalina)? I receive a system warning that Adobe Lightroom 6.14 (perpetual license) is incompatible with future versions of macOS when starting it under macOS Mojave. Lightroom 6 is a 64 bit application, so where is the incompatibility?\n\nA: Catalina drops support for more than just 32bit apps. Kernel Extensions are no longer supported for example. If Lightroom uses a kext, this will not work. Catalina also runs the system from a read only volume. If Lightroom requires modifying any of these folders, then you're out of luck.\nHowever, I don't believe the above is the cause. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Lightroom 6 (what you're using) is Lightroom CC (2015) or earlier right? If that's the case, the last time I used Lightroom CC (2015) the main app is 64bit but parts of the app are 32bit. A quick search online suggests that the parts in LR that are 32bit include Adobe QT32 Server and dynamiclinkmanager.\nI've not tested it, but I suppose there is a small chance that the app could run without these 32bit components. Maybe I should stop speculating.\n\nA: I'm on Catalina beta 3 and my Lightroom 5.7.1 works perfectly. No change in the transition from Mojave. In fact, I received annoying messages in the past (when in Mojave) about the future incompatibility of the software; well, these messages are gone now.\nSo I would say Lightroom 6 should work.\n\nA: LR 6 and 5 are not compatible due to the installer that is 32 bit.  Even Adobe indicates that previously installed versions will likely continue to work.  But you will not be able to install on a fresh install.  Perhaps the installation steps can be replicated, the activation would probably be the most complex.\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/crawlspace/2019/07/upcoming-changes-to-photoshop-lightroom-os-support-with-macos-10-15-catalina.html\n", "Q: How to get statics on OS X finder folder visits?

I was able to fix it by installing Mojave on top of the newly cloned disk. I used a USB install media (after disabling SecureBoot!). The disk booted perfectly after that, with all my files still in place.\nI tried blessing the startup volume (though I may not have used the correct commands); and resetting NVRAM, without luck. I can only assume that the T2 chip 'knows' something has been changed and it requires an Apple installer to reset. \nIt may be possible to perform the 'reset' without having to do an entire OS install, but I don't know what the procedure might be.\n", "Q: Use multi-finger gestures with RealVNC I am using RealVNC for remote access to my Mac from my Android phone.

This command will add all the free space immediately following the partition associated with disk0s2 to the container associated with disk0s2, but only for certain partition types such as Apple_HFS. If a partition of type Apple_HFS is followed immediately by a Apple_Boot type partition, then the following occurs. \n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple_Boot type partition contents is moved to the bottom of any free space immediately following this partition.\n\n*The Apple_HFS type partition (and the volume it contains) is expanded to include the free space between itself and the Apple_BOOT type partition.\n\n\nI should note that after using the diskutil command there could still be a small amount of free space between partitions. The macOS operating system has various rules regarding the requirement of this free space which are not worth mentioning.\nThe diskutil command does not have a way to directly show the free space between partitions in the GPT. A command that can show the free space is called driveinfo, which you can download. This utility is a bash script which uses the diskutil command to determine and display the free space.

I'm currently running 10.13.6 and have a MacBook pro 8,3, 2.2 GHz.\nHow can I upgrade my GPU for my 2011 17\" early to run Mojave?\nI've heard I could replace the logic board with a newer GPU and processor but can't seem to find the company.\nI also heard they offer a 1 year guarantee.\n\nA: To run Mojave on this machine you might to check out macOS Mojave Patcher Tool for Unsupported Macs. A software solution that allows installation – and offers some serious limitations for an unsupported configuration. It does work, but it's probably not worth it in every case. Although you can't beat the price at 0 Dollars… \nTest it out to see if you can live with the limitations inherent to this solution.\nThe 17 inch being a major obstacle for this plan: \nIn 15 inch MacBook Pros you might source a newer logic board that fits into the case. That is probably what \"you heard they offer…\"\nBut 17 inch was never made by Apple after your model. So there never will be anything that was once officially supported by Apple and or Mojave.\nSo your hackish options for that machine are:\n\n\n*\n\n*making your own logic board (perhaps not overly realistic)\n\n*upgrade just the GPU on your existing logic board\n\n\nThe second option is doable (just one example showing the effort and equipment needed). Albeit quite complicated. But it also requires you to find an independent repair shop or other expert willing to do that, and source a replacement GPU. People willing and actually being capable of this will be rare in any case. This is absolutely forbidden by Apple to do for anyone being an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Forget about asking a genius at the bar about this.\nYou'd need to find a 'hacker'-type to solder that in. That will probably not be very cheap, not overly reliable, and again completely unsupported. One problem is that graphic switching gets in the way. \nOnly exchanging the GPU would still leave you with the Intel 3000HD integrated into the Sandy-Bridge CPU. Which is still commonly used then when graphics switching is enabled. \nSo upgrading from a  Terascale Radeon HD 6000 series to a Radeon GCN. For example going from a Radeon HD 6490M to a Radeon HD 7730M. Note how confusing AMD named, and re-branded their chips and cards. And compare how these 'newer' but now equally old chips compare to for example newer integrated Intel iGPUs of the type HD Graphics 620.\nIt also would sensibly require a CPU swap as well. Going to Ivy Bridge, generation 3. Or advanced tinkering with hackintosh configurations, boot loaders, drivers or patches.\nWith \"support\" I not only mean \"never bring that again near an ASAP\" but hardware and software of such a FrankMac (including EFI, smc, OS…) were never tested in this config. The electro-physical connectivity is one thing, the limited compatibility of options Apple decided to ship and support are another. Laptops are so highly integrated these days… I doubt it would be worth it, neither in terms of money, time, effort or ensuing reliability and lifetime of the machine – except for \"we made it do\".\nThe realistic run down is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stay below 10.14\n\n*Use the patcher\n\n*Make the machine stationary and use an eGPU (also not supported and obviously taking away mobility)\n\n*Buy a newer machine\n\n*burn some money on an adventure that may very well ruin the still functioning hardware you have for an exciting experiment with unclear outcomes\n\n\nA: It is not possible to update the MacBook Pro 17\" Early 2011 hardware for supported use with macOS Mojave. It is simply not supported.\nIt is not possible (in any practical sense of the word) to replace the GPU with a newer model, nor do any third party company produce alternative logic boards with newer GPUs that run macOS Mojave. An external GPU won't make it possible to upgrade either as they're not supported on your hardware with Mojave.\nAs hardware upgrades for obtaining compatibility are unrealistic, you might want to look at a software option instead - namely the macOS Mojave Patcher Tool for Unsupported Macs. Basically it removes compatibility checks to make it possible to run Mojave on unsupported hardware, while making various changes to have some support for older hardware:\nhttp://dosdude1.com/mojave/\nNote that it is not a supported option by Apple. It will most probably break at some point during a point-upgrade of macOS. You're also likely to experience various GPU-related problems with your hardware - they advise to disable the discrete GPU. This means that you'll experience lower performance.\nNote that on your model, it is advised to reflash the logic board to disable the switching between GPUs. You'll need an FGPA programmer and the software detailed here:\nhttps://computeco.de/Demux\nIf you don't do that, you'll need to either run without any GPU acceleration (extremely slow), or manually disabling the dedicated GPU like described here:\nhttp://dosdude1.com/gpudisable/\nHowever it also wrecks sleep mode and brightness control.\nSo all in all, it's not going to be an ordinary Mojave experience - you'll find problems, glitches and lower performance.\n", "Q: Why won't the Control Center module let me turn on Airdrop on my iphone 8?

I've experimenting with configuring dnsmasq on macOS for Apache vhosts instead of creating entries in /etc/resolver/<domain> for each domain.

Maybe some else could comment or post an answer.\n\n\nAfterwards, you could erase the old APFS container partition to create free space immediately after the new APFS container partition. You could then use the diskutil apfs resizeContainer command to add this new free space to the new APFS container partition\nCreating new APFS container partition would involve several steps. Some of these steps would have to be preformed while booted to macOS Recovery. You should backup your files before attempting these steps.

If I have a standard IMAP mail account set as my default on an iOS device and I then attempt to send somebody an invetation from the Calendar app, what happens if the recipient doesn't have an Apple ID - how will the invitation appear to them?\nNo documentation that I could find online makes reference to this situation; the only things I could find were concerning sending invitations to existing Apple IDs (at which point a notification is generated on the device itself), or about using Exchange Accounts - which again works differently. My assumption was that Apple must send an email of some kind to the invitee, but I want to get it tested.\n\nA: I just tried with one of my friends' email.

Somehow online installation from recovery mode is also not working and throws 202 error at the end. \nIs there any luck? \n\nA: I just came into the same situation. But I was lucky enough to workaround it last night. It took me 2 nights searching around to figure out what to do.\nHere's what you need:\n*. A functioning Mac(Better without a T2 chip), mine is the 2014 Mac Mini.\nEdit: For T2 chip devices, you could temporarily set the security options to allow boot from external devices.(Reboot and then Command + R,not personally tested)\n*. An SSD for a fresh install.\n*. Create a bootable macOS USB drive.\nI will make it short. You could search for tutorials if you don't know what to do for a certain step.\n\n*\n\n*Plug in both SSD and bootable USB drive(with Mojave installer).\n\n\n*Reboot your mac and press Command + R.\n\n\n*Install a fresh Mojave on your SSD, and stop when you see the welcome screen where it asks you to select your country.\n\n\n*Power off and unplug the SSD off your functioning Mac.\n\n\n*Plug your SSD onto your MBP and turn it on.\n\n\n*Press Command + R and enter the recovery mode.\n\n\n*Disk Utilities -> Restore. Here select your SSD and it will copy your SSD's files onto your MBP. And then you can unplug your SSD.\n\n\n*You could try select your internal drive as start up disk but it doesn't let you to. So reboot your MBP. And press Command + R. In my case it failed to boot the macOS and it just reboot into the recovery mode again.\n\n\n*Select Install Mojave. After a couple of minutes, your screen turns black and it reboots.\n\n\n*You will see the lovely Welcome screen again.\n\nA: I had to boot into recovery mode and reinstall High Sierra (the initial shipped version of macOS). Installing HS gave an administrator account. With the administrator account I was able to allow booting from any external device and finally booted from mac USB stick macOS mojave. After that I could remove HS.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with my 2018 Mini: I had to delete the .AppleSetupDone file and run the \"Welcome to Mac\" routine, creating a new admin user there before I could alter SecureBoot, even though the disk had been imaged with an admin user. \nPeter Thorn's answer here gets to the exact cause of the problem and provides the solution for a working Mac that has MacOS installed.\nIf you don't have MacOs installed, you could try booting it in Target Mode from another Mac, which I understand bypasses the Secure Boot! (Though if the drive is encrypted, you'll need the password, unless you're wiping it anyway.)\nAlternatively, take it to an Apple Store. The SecureBoot settings can't be changed unless there is a valid admin user, so you can't boot to an external. Recovery is another option, but you say that's not working.\nPS. I'd love to work somewhere where you get to keep your laptop when you resign!\n\nA: To my experience, it is a question of Secure Tokens, if it doesn't accept the admin even though it has the shipped (old) macOS installed from the recovery partition. \nEven though you have created an admin account, you need it to have a Secure Token and update the preboot, for the recovery partition to accept it.\nI did the following (when logged in as the local admin account) (both commands run in Terminal):\nsysadminctl interactive -secureTokenOn [admin user shortname] -password -\n(you will be asked to authenticate).\ndiskutil apfs updatePreboot /\n\nA: I managed to get around this by using Disk Utility (from recovery mode) to \"restore\" my internal drive with the image on my external bootable drive. Voila, your bootable drive is no longer \"external\" and you can boot from it. You'll probably want to create a separate partition on your internal drive for the bootable partition to install to; ideally your second partition is the installer so that you can delete it later without the \"you can't remove the first volume on the disk\" error.\n\nA: I was able to get to recovery mode by starting to select a start up disk and then quitting with Command - Q. Took me back to recovery mode and I was able to install Mojave on the internal drive.\n(I had this exact issue and foolishly wiped the drive not realizing that the security was set to only internal drives.)\nWilliam Tong’s answer is great, but similar to commenter, I could still not boot into recovery with the blank Mojave’s SSD. It would prompt that it couldn’t boot from external drive and to choose a startup disk or restart.\n\nA: After referencing this article on Apple: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8509743 and going through all three of that thread's recommendations:\n\n*\n\n*Enable secure token in Terminal using the command: sysadminctl interactive -secureTokenOn  -password  -\nThis threw the following error: 2022-10-20 11:00:27.406 sysadminctl[1137:7904] setSecureTokenAuthorizationEnabled error Error Domain=com.apple.OpenDirectory Code=5101 \"Authentication server refused operation because the current credentials are not authorized for the requested operation.\" UserInfo={NSUnderlyingError=0x600000c41350 {Error Domain=com.apple.OpenDirectory Code=5101 \"No existing unlock record\" UserInfo={NSDescription=No existing unlock record}}, NSLocalizedDescription=Authentication server refused operation because the current credentials are not authorized for the requested operation., NSLocalizedFailureReason=Authentication server refused operation because the current credentials are not authorized for the requested operation.}\n\n*Toggle FileVault on and then off again. - Filevault would not enable, so the first part of that sequence can’t be completed.\n\n*Use the MacOS Setup Assistant to create a new admin account by deleting /var/db/.AppleSetupDone - This was the first thing I tried; but the resulting admin account either didn’t generate the token or could not set it to On as it should have.\n\nAfter all three of those failed, since I didn't need anything on the MBP's internal SSD, just get it deployable, I booted into Recovery, deleted the Boot volume, created a new Boot volume, and installed Monterrey into the new APFS volume. This apparently corrected whatever was at fault in BridgeOS, as the 501 admin account was recognized by the Startup Security Utility as an admin, and FileVault could be enabled normally.\n", "Q: How do you clear SSL leaf certificates mappings to particular domains I visit my website using Chrome on macOS Mojave, for example, qa.abc.com, and the SSL leaf certificate is from customer-test.ssl.fastly.net. I recently updated the CNAME record in my DNS for qa.abc.com so that it should point b3.shared.global.fastly.net. When I visit qa.abc.com, it resolves the SSL certificate at customer-test.ssl.fastly.net instead of b3.shared.global.fastly.net.\nYou would think clearing the cache might do the trick, but nope, whether it's Chrome's incognito mode or clearing its cache, still the same. Then I checked on both Safari, Firefox, and even tried to run the following command in my Terminal:\necho | openssl s_client -connect qa.abc.com:443\nwith the result being:\n---\nCertificate chain\n 0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=Fastly, Inc./CN=customer-test.ssl.fastly.net\n   i:/C=BE/O=GlobalSign nv-sa/CN=GlobalSign CloudSSL CA - SHA256 - G3\n 1 s:/C=BE/O=GlobalSign nv-sa/CN=GlobalSign CloudSSL CA - SHA256 - G3\n   i:/C=BE/O=GlobalSign nv-sa/OU=Root CA/CN=GlobalSign Root CA\n\nIf I jump onto my brother's Windows 10 machine on the same wifi network, the website correctly pulls the SSL certificate from b3.shared.global.fastly.net. If I access the site via my iPhone 6, it's correctly pulling from b3.shared.global.fastly.net. If I browse on my MacBook via tethering on my iPhone 6, it still shows up as customer-test.ssl.fastly.net.\nSo, we know that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not related to the browser, since all browsers are affected the\nsame way, including openssl at the command line\n\n*It's not related to the network, since other devices on the same network work fine.\n\n\nI suspect that the mapping between a SSL certificate and a domain is cached somewhere at the operating system level.\nOther things I've tried but did not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rebooting the computer by shutting it off and powering it back on\n\n*Look for any expired certificates in Keychain Access (yes, already enabled viewing hidden expired certificates), but found nothing related to my website or Fastly, and did not find anything wrong with any of the Globalsign certificates.\n\n*Tried to delete CRL and OCSP Cache for GlobalSign, but it's not relevant because /var/db/crls/crlcache.db, /var/db/crls/ocspcache.db, nor ~/Library/Keychains/*/ocspcache.sqlite3 exist in macOS Mojave.\n\n\nA: There's no caching of SSL-certificates like this. It is not a caching issue on the client.\nThe problem here is with the server - it presents the wrong certificate (from your point of view).\nThe reason that some clients see one certificate and others see another is most probably due to CDN and/or load-balancing, which means that you're not really hitting the same endpoint. It sounds likely that the server is using persistent connections (aka sticky sessions) which means that your MacBook sees one thing, but your iPhone and Windows 10 machine another thing.\nThis is something you need to solve at the server level. It hasn't got anything to do with your Mac as such.\n\nA: So, it turns out what happened was that I mapped the domain to specific IP in my local /etc/hosts file. It was pointing to a CDN node that was serving up the old certificate. Once I removed the entry, it was pointing to a new node with the correct certificate.\n", "Q: My iPhone won't show any Discord iOS push notifications, yet it will show them from other apps I've already tried checking all of my settings, and everything is in order.\nNotifications enabled both in and out of Discord, yet I still don't get any notifications.\nHelp? I've already uninstalled and reinstalled discord, and restarted my phone a few times.\n\nA: This is a Discord “feature” that you can’t turn off. Discord will not send mobile notifications if the desktop app is open (official staff response). Here are some community posts requesting Discord to change this feature:\n\n*\n\n*Allow 0 minute setting for \"Push Notification AFK timeout\"\n\n*Displaying Discord Notifcations on the Phone and the Computer at the same time.\n\n*push notifications not sent on android\nDiscord tries to avoid being annoying in the hopes that it reduces the chance that you uninstall it by not sending push notifications when it thinks you are active at your computer. There is a setting to set the number of minutes Discord waits after you become inactive at your computer prior to resuming push notification in the desktop app under Settings / Notifications. You can only set this down to 1 minute. So you won’t get push notifications until Discord thinks you’ve not been at your computer for at least a minute. But apparently Discord likes to think that many people are using their computers even when they aren’t much of the time.\nPeople report that fully quitting the desktop app of Discord sometimes triggers Discord to start sending push notifications to your phone immediately. You can still use Discord from a web browser without affecting push notifications if you don’t need any features from the desktop app.\n\nA: Try to check the following :\n\n\n*\n\n*check server notification(Beside server name … button, notification\nsetting), makesure no silent.\n\n*check Discord app notification setting(setting > notification),\nmakesure is turn on.\n\n*try no force close Discord (leave Discord in \"double\nclick/multitasking\", do not slip off). If can then is memory no\nenough problem. Try to uninstall some app.\n\n*only can receive notification in WiFi environment, try turn on mobile\ndata permission\n\n\nJust a suggestion.\n", "Q: How to create a bootable Windows 10 USB with a Mac to boot/install on a PC?

Previously on my MacBook Air 2013 I was able to increment/decrement screen brightness, volume and the keyboard backlight in quarter steps when pressing  ⌥+⇧ and a media key. This doesn't seem to work anymore with the Touch Bar on my 2019 MacBook Pro 16\" running macOS Catalina.\nIt seems to work for some people as can be seen from https://youtu.be/_MQFS-0eqtk and https://youtu.be/dTCbKYIqLqs, but it does not work for me. I've tried on a 2019 15\" on Mojave and on my personal 16\" and work 16\" on Catalina.\nOkey, I have tried two of my colleagues 16\" MacBook Pros and the feature works fine for them. This must be something just wrong with my system.\n\nA: Tap the arrow on the left of the system area to expand the full list of system buttons, then use the brightness increase and decrease buttons from there.\n(If you've removed them, you might need to go to View → Customize Touch Bar and add them back in.)\nSince those buttons have the exact same function as non-Touch Bar models, you can use the alt + shift combination to get the quarter-step changes.\n\nA: Quarter-step adjustments are still alive and well. \nI'm running a 2019 MBP and all you have to do is expand the control strip and hold Shift and Option while toggling the desired Up or Down buttons.\nControl strip minimised:\n\nControl strip expanded:\n\nKeep in mind that the control strip can be customised, so what I have on mine may be different to yours, but the volume and brightness up and down buttons are still available as options.\nI have recorded a YouTube video to demonstrate.\n\nA: I am on 13-inch, 2019 MacBookPro with Mojave and touch bar.\nThe quarter increments  option ⌥  +  Shift ⇧  + either of:[volume , brightness , keyboard backlight], works just fine (same as on my mid 2014 13\" MacBookPro did).\nOne note though: the increments by 1/4 work all the way down to 0 with the sound, for the keyboard it's really hard to tell the difference of 1/4 vs 1, but for screen it only works in 1/4 increment from full to 1 bar; There is no difference between 1, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4 bar which is a real shame because that is where it would be the most useful for me. :'(\n\nA: Found out that the issue occurs only when I have Karabiner Elements running. Makes sense that it has occurred on every single machine I've used, because I always have that program open, but others most probably do not.\nSince it's clearly a bug in Karabiner, I've opened a GitHub issue for it.\nEDIT:\nThe issue has been fixed in the latest Karabiner Elements 13.0.0\n", "Q: Wi-Fi really slow on Mac until I reboot I have a Mac running Mojave 10.14.5. \nI have an issue with the home Wi-Fi. I have a 400Mbps internet connection. When I start the laptop, the Wi-Fi is fine and I'm getting expected internet speeds (as per fast.com), but at some point it drops to less than 100Mbps (again, as per fast.com), and somehow this affects all other devices (phone, tv) connected to the same Wi-Fi.\nBut then just after I restart the Mac, the speed goes to 400Mbps again, on both the Mac and the other devices.\nHow can I troubleshoot this situation?\nEdit: I added and Image of how things look when connection drops.\n\n\nA: In case it helps anyone: I was running into a similar problem with a 2017 MacBook Pro but found a different solution... download speeds on other devices (iPhones, newer MBP) were around 500-750 Mbps down, but on my 2017 MBP the speeds were way slower (anywhere from like 5-10 Mbps, sometimes even <1 Mbps, all tested using fast.com and Vodafone's speed testing service). After restarting either the router or the 2017 MBP, download speeds were back to normal on the 2017 MBP. However, the speed would gradually decrease until it was (relatively) super slow again.\nI tried troubleshooting by looking in the \"Network\" tab of Activity Monitor to see if anything was hogging bandwidth, uninstalling VPNs, closing all applications one at a time, using a different browser, etc. Nothing seemed to work. Restarting the computer worked well but is time-consuming and pretty disruptive to workflow, so ultimately I decided to try restarting just the networking using the following terminal commands:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 off\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nFor me at least, this works to bring normal speeds back. It takes like 15-20 seconds total (opening terminal, copying/pasting the code, waiting for wifi to reconnect), and I know it's not technically fixing the problem... but it's better than nothing and hope it can help someone else too.\n\nA: I found the culprit. I had a software called Pulse Secure (to connect to my workplace). I uninstalled it and BOOM! Problem fixed. If you have the same problem, it is most likely some VPN software (even if not connected to it)\n\nA: WiFi devices will reduce speeds if they detect too many errors at the higher rates. For example, in your screenshot, your WiFi radio has negotiated a fairly decent RF speed (MCS 9, 867Mbps) with the router. (It would be interesting to see what the router says, as Tx and Rx can differ.) \nOver time, radio link quality changes, causing the radios at both ends to adjust Tx/Rx rates. If too many packets error out, the radios will back off to lower rates. If the error levels drop, the radios will (eventually) negotiate back up to better speeds. Rebooting it just resets the error counters; it's not actually fixing anything.\nWhen your speed seems slower, check to see what rate the radio says it's negotiated with the router (and check the router's view of your laptop too).  If it's lower, there's a reason, such as interference or another RF problem.\nThe 802.11ac standard also supports MIMO (multiple in, multiple out), which requires all devices to utilize more than one antenna to get maximum throughput (which is somewhere above 1Gbps I believe).  There could be a situation where the AP radio is negotiating just a single channel with your laptop and multiple channels with other devices that come on after it does.\nWithout knowing what kind of router you have or how many other devices are on the network, it's hard to say what else could be causing the slow-down's/back-off's.  \nOn most routers there are advanced wireless settings that can affect how clients interact with the router.  In my experience, it is useful to disable the fancy settings (or setting them to defaults), then test each one until you find the culprit.\n\nA: I've had this problem on PCs too.  Turned out to be my router.  I replaced it with a Ubiquiti Unifi LR Access Point and that fixed all of my issues.  The Unifi is a little harder to setup because it has a software controller but the speeds are insane.  I get 50-75 Mbps downloads frequently.\nThe TX rate in the picture you posted is literally 108.37 MB/Sec so it looks like it is communicating fine but like I said mine looked good too... but it wasn't.  \nIf you think it might be the AP try using WireShark to watch for bad packets on your wifi interface.  Like Bryan said, that could be the cause of your slow down.  If you're getting bad packets replace the router.\n\nA: If yours is macbook air M1. try this.\nsudo ifconfig awdl0 down\n\nhttps://osxdaily.com/2022/12/12/m2-m1-macbook-having-wi-fi-issues-this-workaround-helps/\n", "Q: Keys falling off from butterfly: change keycap is enough or do i need to change clip?

I have a program I'm using to write xml with variables, and it passes through AppleScript and bash to form the final xml. However, one of my variables usually begins with \"024\", \"054\", or other three digit codes that paired with the \"\\\" forms an octal character, like \",\" for \"\\054\". Once they are passed through bash, they become replaced with these octal characters. These variables need to stay the way they are, because they are part of a file path the xml ultimately pulls from. Unfortunately, I can't change these variables because they're linked to many other things working properly, and the backslashes are obligatory too. I want to know if there is a way to stop AppleScript from implementing octal encoding on this script as it passes through. A colleague recommended using iconv, which I tried unsuccessfully, partially because I'm not sure how to use it properly. Here is the AppleScript for reference:\ndo shell script \"echo \\\"<?xml version=\\\\\\\"1.0\\\\\\\" encoding=\\\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\\\"?> <scratch project=\\\\\\\"TEST\\\\\\\"> <file>W:\\\\Sequences\\\\087_TLD_TL_Taking_The_Lead\\\\Shots\\\\TLD0640\\\\Versions\\\\MOV\\\\TLD0640_v0173.mov\\\\</file> </scratch>\\\" > ~/Desktop/Test.xml\"\nAnd the output:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scratch project=\"TEST\"> <file>W:\\Sequences87_TLD_TL_Taking_The_Lead\\Shots\\TLD0640\\Versions\\MOV\\TLD0640_v0173.mov\\</file> </scratch>\nThank you for your help!\nEdit: thanks Gordon Davisson for making the code viewable, and updated the codes to the bare minimum for reproducing the question.\n\nA: It looks like do shell script is running the script under the sh shell, which is actually bash in compatibility mode; in this mode, the builtin echo command apparently thinks it needs to interpret some escape (backslash) sequences. This is one of several features of echo that aren't consistent between versions/modes/etc; as the POSIX standard for echo says, \"It is not possible to use echo portably across all POSIX systems unless both -n (as the first argument) and escape sequences are omitted.\"\nSo, my first recommendation is to use printf '%s\\n instead of echo (and the backslash will need to be doubled to get it past AppleScript):\ndo shell script \"printf '%s\\\\n' \\\"<?xml version=\\\\\\\"1.0\\\\\\\" encoding=\\\\\\\"UTF-8\\\\\\\"?> <scratch project=\\\\\\\"TEST\\\\\\\"> <file>W:\\\\Sequences\\\\087_TLD_TL_Taking_The_Lead\\\\Shots\\\\TLD0640\\\\Versions\\\\MOV\\\\TLD0640_v0173.mov\\\\</file> </scratch>\\\" > ~/Desktop/Test.xml\"\n\nBut even with echo getting into the act, you still have multiple confusing levels of quotes and escapes due to interpretation by AppleScript and the shell. I'd recommend storing the XML as an AppleScript variable (using just a single level of quoting/escaping, for consumption by AppleScript), then using quoted form of to quote/escape that for use in the shell command:\nset XML_Content to \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"UTF-8\\\"?> <scratch project=\\\"TEST\\\"> <file>W:\\\\Sequences\\\\087_TLD_TL_Taking_The_Lead\\\\Shots\\\\TLD0640\\\\Versions\\\\MOV\\\\TLD0640_v0173.mov\\\\</file> </scratch>\"\n\ndo shell script \"printf '%s\\\\n' \" & (quoted form of XML_Content) & \" > ~/Desktop/Test.xml\"\n\n", "Q: Instagram upload picture problem While uploading pictures to Instagram I am getting the following error:\n\nCould not open photo.

There is a little you can do. Hit altcmdU and see it in an even worse format but at least the text lines would break way before the width ends. \nThe shortcut corresponds to View menu → Message → Raw Source.\n\nA: This is an HTML part of a message formatted with an unprofessionnal client or directly from a software ill programmed (you can read the culprit name within the raw text source with Mail it should be within the header field X-Mailer: unless it is a really very bad software).\nUnfortunatly, Mail doesn't provide any method to display such an ill formatted message as plain text. This is a serious problem since many attack E-mail (most notably phishing attacks) are using this technic to steal private information\nor to make you connect on a booby trapped web server.\nIf you are worried by the global security problem of displaying E-mail messages as HTML, I would advise you to use a more professionnal E-mail client like Thunderbird:\nhttps://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/\nIn this case, you will be very easily able to display any suspicious E-mail as plain text, but not as raw source, i.e. a humain readable plain text:\nView > Message Body As > Plain Text\n\n\nAnother security function of Thunderbird is worth noting. When you are not sure of the true sender of an E-mail which can very easily be forged, it will enable you to display all headers which will train you to quickly recognize forged From: and To: headers:\nView > Headers > All\n\nMost of the time you will even see the IP address and the program used by the attacker.\n", "Q: Sort files by spreadsheet I have a folder than contains over 1000 text files.

The phone reports decent 3G connectivity and can make phone calls, but it does not connect to data services. Data services work when using older SIM cards from the same carrier. Also, the new SIM card works when installed in newer phones (testet on an iPhone SE and an iPhone X).\nSo, out of six possible phone and SIM combinations, the only one not working is the oldest phone with the newest SIM card. All SIM cards are from the same carrier, and the Mobile Data Network settings are as recommended by the carrier, and identical across the phones, except that the oldest phone is a 3G phone, while the newer models support 4G/LTE.\nCan the new SIM card be incompatible with older phones? If not, what can the issue be? The carrier support has been unhelpful so far.\n\nA: I heard back from the carrier. They informed that the subscription for the new SIM card only accepts 4G connections and not older. So these types of subscriptions will work for iPhone 5 and newer, but not iPhone 4S and older.\n", "Q: Face ID stopped working Recently my Face ID on iPhone X stopped working. It didn't react to my face anymore and didn't even display an error while trying to unlock the phone, but rather just repeatedly trying to focus the image back and forth and -nothing. I did Face id function reset and tried to record a new face sample, but it was not possible. Same problem. Like the true sensor or camera is not managing to do the job supposed to do. \nI googled it on the internet and mainly encountered suggestions to reset Face ID, Reset Settings of the iPhone or Erase and Reset the whole phone. I did all three and the problem still persists. \nIs it possible that it is a hardware bug? \nThe day before this problem started, the phone got a bit wet (I was on kayaking, and the phone was with me in the kayak, but the water that got to it was not at all that significant - it never went heavily underwater - maybe it was lying in an inch of water that was in a kayak for a short time)\nAny ideas what I might do to solve this issue? \nThanks \n\nA: Yes, it is most likely that this is a hardware problem - although you couldn't really call it a \"bug\".\nAs this happened right after the phone was subjected to water, and none of the usual resets of the phone's software helped, it is most likely water damaged. You might think that an inch of water isn't much, but when you go kayaking that water isn't \"pure water\". It is likely that it has damaged the hardware somehow.\nI would take it to Apple or a repair shop to get an estimate on the costs to fix it!\n", "Q: MBP TB 2016 Failed to format and crashes. APFS Container damaged? Hy everyone!\nI need help restoring my MBP.\n2016 MBP15TB\nI made a USB stick with Mojave, restarted with Command+R, went into disk util, and wanted to erase my SSD to start the install. The computer was working fine earlier today, but had a lot of crap on it and I wanted to start fresh. Had about 260GB free space.\nUnfortunately this did not work, and the erase process crashed.\nLooked online and found a topic here and found out that you can delete the apfs container manually in terminal with diskutil.\nFound a YT video explaining it and it worked until the process actually started.\nWhen in gets to 50%, it crashes again and restarts.\nFormat does not happen. I can try erase from the disk utility and it does the same. No % shown but after unmounting everything it hang for a few secs and crashes again.\nCannot load back to the original OS either.\nAlso diskutil list shows 22 disks for some reason that i do not understand.\nHere is a video on what's happening:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg25MFLcQc4&feature=youtu.be\nAnyone have any idea what to do? How to clean the SSD for a full clean install?\nThank you.\n\nA: This is the official answer from me on what fixed the issue.\nIf you run into this same situation(rare case really) this is how it was fixed.\nThe background: MBP 2016 with TB, updated normally, converted to APFS and had at one point windows running on it with bootcamp.\nI decided to format the drive and reinstall clean because i had a lot of clutter on it and moved everything to cloud, so i can have more space.\nFollowed the apple guideline and made a bootable installer USB.\nFollowed the erase process, and in the middle of that my MBP crashed with a kernel panic.\nKernel panic happened with disk utility and terminal. Tried multiple methods.\nMy APFS container was damaged and disk utility was unable to resolve it.\nThe OS was gone, it was not booting. The only sign on the screen was a circle with a diagonal line in it. Recovery still worked.\nTook it to apple store and started working on it with genius bar guys.\nAfter 3 hours most of them gave up and said needs an ssd repair because this is a hardware issue($800). I was thinking differently, because it was fine a few hours earlier. Then another genius came up with an idea that became the solution.\nWe connected another macbook pro with a thunderbolt cable to mine, and turned mine on while holding T.\nThis way we tried to format the drive using the new macbook pro's disk utility.\nSurprisingly worked, and was able to format the drive in HFS in 15 seconds.\nInstall still crashed but we were able to use my disk utility and reformat to APFS, and run the installer again. Crashed again.\n3rd time we did PRAM and NVRAM reset, run the installer again and no crash, Restarted, with apple logo and a timer.\nFinished with a working OS and booted to the welcome screen.\nCurrently its still running, and the partition table cleaned up.\nIf you watched my video, the ghost drives from diskutil list disappeared.\nThe only thing showing now is the current new APFS container, with correct names and sizes.\nDrive speed test shows good speeds, no crashes so far. Installed some apps and updates.\nI will update this thread if another issue comes up but hopefully it will stay stable for a long time!\nCheers!\nDavid\n\nA: Helo, and welcome to Ask Different. (Please excuse my spelling, for some reason Ask Different deletes the word if I start with the word hello.)\nYour problem might be that you're restarting into your Recovery Partition instead of your external Installer. \nYou can boot into your installer by pressing Option when restarting, and then selecting to restart into a volume named something like MacOS Installer. Right now you're restarting into your recovery partition (by restarting while holding Command+R), and then trying to erase your SSD which includes the recovery partition.\nAs for diskutil showing a strange number of disks, I'm not sure why that happens, but that's not abnormal (it happens to me too).\n", "Q: GarageBand iOS on iPad Air, MIDI cable, Roland/Wurlitzer: How do I make something out of this combo? I just got a 3.5mm to MIDI adapter so I can use it with my Roland EXR-3 Interactive Arranger or use it with my Wurlitzer Omni 3600, which both have in and out MIDI ports. I just want to use the cable, and involve Garageband in the use of it. How do I either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make the sounds from Garageband come out of the keyboard's speakers (either using the keys on the keyboard, or just playing the virtual keys on the screen), or\n\n*Record sounds from my keyboards into a Garageband track?\n\n\nA: The two objectives you have are not possible to achieve as such using a MIDI adapter cable.\nThe MIDI adapter cables carries a digital protocol with information such as note on/off with notes, velocity, etc., pitch bends, patch changes, etc. No analog waveforms or other representations of actual sounds are sent over MIDI.\nTherefore transferring actual sounds from Garageband to the keyboard's speakers is not possible - and similarly recording the sounds made by your keyboard into a Garageband audio track is also not possible.\nIf you want to achieve those objectives, you'll need instead to purchase analog audio cables and a audio recording interface for the iPad - or use the 3.5\" input (not that well suited). \nWhat you can achieve with the MIDI adapter is to use a MIDI-compatible app to send out MIDI notes to the keyboard which can then play its own sounds through its speakers. \nSimilarly you can record MIDI notes from the keyboard into an instrument track in a MIDI-compatible app. However, when playing it back, the audio will come out through the keyboard's speakers - and the keyboard will need to be connected to playback the track. \nAlternatively you can use GarageBand with a virtual instrument, which will create the instrument sound from the MIDI notes and play it back through your iPad's speakers.\n", "Q: Cannot login to macbook pro due to keyboard not working. Mouse can move, but not click I was just watching a youtube video on chrome with no other programs running, when my keyboard stopped working.\nI could still move the mouse with the trackpad, but not click. I could use the upper row of keys (brightness, volume…) but not the other ones.\nI left the computer alone for a few minutes, thinking it was lag, so it logged me out.  Now I cannot log in because the keyboard does not work, and although I can move the cursor around on the login screen, I cannot click the switch user button.\nIn the past this issue has been resolved by resetting PRAM and restarting, but as the keyboard failure happens randomly, it is very frustrating to loose all my unsaved work every few weeks when this happens.\n7 hours later, testing my keyboard every hour, I discovered the problem disappeared as it appeared.\nIs there anyway to fix this without restarting?\nHow can I prevent this from happening again?\n\nA: To regain keyboard access to your machine to troubleshoot the fault and restore correct functionality, here are (2) options to get back into your machine:\nOption 1: Wireless Keyboard\nBuy a Wireless (USB) Keyboard which uses a USB dongle that looks like a USB Flash Drive that you can just insert into a USB port (or USB-C adapter) and it should \"just work\".  This should enable you to regain the required access to troubleshoot the fault to restore normal keyboard functionality. A wireless Keyboard I like is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logitech K400 (Wireless)\n\n\nNote: Although I initially suggested a Bluetooth keyboard in addition to the Wireless one, since it's not possible to \"click\" to add the Bluetooth device to your system this is a non-starter on a system broken in such a way as you describe.\nAlthough I'm in Amsterdam at the mo' and unable to test it on my Macbook, I Googled and the k400 is Mac compatible.  I actually use this one with Raspberry Pi's, but might need it when my own Macbook's keyboard craps-out ;-)\nOption 2: Remote Access Via SSH (requires another computer)\nWhen I’ve had issues with things like this in the past, I’ve gotten in remotely via SSH. If you can get into the machine via SSH, you can troubleshoot the fault as well as get files you require until the issue Is resolved. Could use a cheap £32 Raspberry Pi to get a terminal session going into the Mac with the broken keyboard.\nThis possible solution implies of course you’ve enabled the SSH access in your system preferences as below:\n\n\nGiven the problems with Apple's keyboards these past few years, I don't doubt others might be having similar issues.\nFinally, I'd suggest storing docs in iCloud (DropBox is also really good, but with the codicile that it's not integrated into Apple's ecosphere like iCloud) so you can access your data if you keep having grief with your keyboard-\n\nA: The real question is: Is this a hardware failure or a software problem?\nIf it's a hardware problem, then you need to take it to an Apple Store or other authorised repair shop. There is currently a repair programme for known problems to some new models.\nIf you can get your hands on a USB keyboard, you can see whether that works, or if the problem remains.\nIf it's a software problem, then you need to do some detective work to see if some process is preventing keyboard input somehow. Keep Activity Monitor open, and see if anything is using excessive CPU or memory when the problem occurs. Uninstall any third-party software that might be controlling the system (Check the Privacy System Preference and see what is allowed in the Accessibility list.) See if the problem occurs in a brand new user account (This is a test, not a solution!)\nWith regard to losing your work, I would recommend an app like Forever Save2, which can be configured to auto-save each application's documents with different time intervals and versions.\n\nA: Tools to hunt the origin of the problem\nWhat is too busy with my keyboard?\nWhen this partial lost of keyboard occurs, type cmd ⌘+alt ⌥+ESC and check any application which might be grabbing your keyboard.\nIn case of suspicion, kill one application at a time, starting with the ones which don't have any file open (avoid System Preferences…, Pages, TextEdit…).\nWho grab my keyboard?\nDownload this Python script: watch_activations.py\nStart a Terminal and from wherever you installed this script, make it executable with:\nchmod u+x watch_activations.py\n\nand execute it with:\n./watch_activations.py\n\n[ Don't run it with sudo, this script is innocuous. ]\nKeep this window always visible so as to see which application context was activated when your keyboard partially disappears.\nWas my keyboard switched in a very assistive mode?\nWhen this partial lost of keyboard occurs, hit cmd ⌘+alt ⌥+F5\nand check that nothing unusual was unwillingly checked.\n", "Q: Problem in installing Xcode on MacBook Air 2017 with macos Mojave version 10.14.5 I am trying to download Xcode from the mac app store but it fails again and again. I am using my mobile hotspot for internet. It has a daily data limit of 2.5 GB but Xcode is of 6.1 GB. Once I put Xcode on download from the app store and it processed till 2 GB and then it failed saying slow internet connection. I also tried to pause the download in between but on resuming, it restarts from the starting. I also tried to download it from Apple's website but that also didn't work. Please help with this issue.\n\nA: You can try to download bittorrent version of Xcode but there's always a risk of downloading files from unknown source and you may not be able to find the latest version, as I could only find Xcode 9.\nSide note: In the past, I would've recommended a tool called ADCDownload, which allows you to resume downloads from Apple Developer website.

I don't know how how that worked - maybe iOS tried to free up some space by removing the thumbnails (without asking me???). \nThe main advice is to remove the photos.sqlite and other similar files from PhotoData directory. That did nothing - the restored base is lacking my OLD ones. Still you can find them all in DCIM folder. \nHow can I add them back to sqlite??? Thanks a lot!! \nupd. ios 9.1\n\nA: To free space in iPhotos (\"Camera Roll\"), on your iPhone (or iPad) go to:\nAlbums > Recently Deleted and then select the photos for permanent deletion.  I'll bet you have tons of photos there gobbing up space.  That should take a lot of pressure off on your available space for photos.  Myself, well I didn't know that was there for ages ... ;-)\nUpdate: After further details from the OP, sounds like he CAN take pictures and they are stored on the device, but these pics are just not appearing in \"Camera Roll\".  I suspect \"Camera Roll\" is an alias to the DCIM storage location.  Could be something wrong with how the thumbnails linking to the DCIM storage folder you reference are added.  Thus, the advice you were receiving on removing the SQL-lite db.\nCamera Roll itself must be an alias to that DCIM folder.  It would make no logical sense to have pictures stored in BOTH the DCIM folder and also Camera Roll.  How these things interact would appear to be where the problem exists.\nI remember with Outlook .pst folders there was a (2) GB limit (I believe) that buggered everything once the file hit 2GB.  I just checked this for you and the max SQL Lite file size is 140 TB, so this can't be the problem.  HOWEVER, the size of the query as to what's retrievable in memory from a huge SQL Lite DB CAN be a limiting factor:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/14451624/will-sqlite-performance-degrade-if-the-database-size-is-greater-than-2-gigabytes\nThe upper limit as to the SQL query to the SQL Lite DB required to display the pics in \"Camera Roll\" looks a likely candidate if your pictures store is huge and the query size required to display them in Camera Roll is limited in memory\n", "Q: Apple iPhone won't connect to insecure website A certificate is expired of an application of ours and a client still wants to access it.

Is there a way to ignore the message and proceed?\n\n\nA: If the certificate has expired, but HSTS is enabled, it is not possible to bypass the error message ‘Safari cannot open the page because it could not establish a secure connection to the server’.\n\nTo bypass an expired certificate for a site without HSTS, choose Show Details, then ‘visit this website’.\n\n\nIf the certificate is was revoked, a similar error message is shown but it cannot be bypassed.\n", "Q: Why is encrypted APFS on SD cards so slow? When writing any data to SD cards, the operation is usually very slow compared to other kinds of media (up to tens ob MBytes/s). However, when using an encrypted file system on the SD card, such as encrypted APFS, the write operations tend to be even slower, for example one fourth of the transfer rate. Why is this the case? Modern CPUs should provide special instructions that are also used for any other file vault operation.\n\nA: I suspect the encrypted vs unencrypted read and write speed has to do with continuous vs random performance on (Micro-) SD cards as measured and described here: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/raspberry-pi-microsd-card-performance-comparison-2019\n", "Q: gnupg not found I am trying to install rvm.

Last week I downloaded a zipfile from a website on my mac. When it finished downloading the file automatically opened (which it normally doesn’t; I would normally have to double click it first). This was already strange but I didn’t think too much of it.\nIt asked me for a password, which I did not know. When I clicked “cancel” the archive utility just quit.\nAfter that, when I looked in my downloads folder the file was no longer there. So I looked in my trash folder to be shocked to see that the file wasn’t there either. So basically, the file was behaving very strangely and had just deleted itself.\nWhat does this mean? Is this just something archive utility can do? Or can it be that the file might have been malicious?\n\nA: The zip file cannot “self delete”.\nThere is a setting for “Archive Utility” in most versions of Mac OS X / OSX / macOS where you can specify you’d like to delete Zip files after extraction.\nSee:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/delete-zip-files-after-extraction\n\nCheck if you have this feature turned on:\n\nIf you have this feature turned on already:\nI believe this is intended to work only after a successful extraction.

(Yes, you can create a zip file with a mix of password protected and “unprotected” files.)\nIf the zip had even just one non-password protected file (like README.TXT) that unzipped correctly, it may be present and Archive Utility might have deleted the zip.

I am using windows 10.\nI unlocked the phone and connected it to the computer, it appears in the file explorer.\n\nI was able to move all files appearing in there to the external harddrive (I was unable to delete the folders btw, I had to open each folder and delete all files there...)\nI thought that was it, but if I open the iPhone and go to photos then there are still thousands of photos, even though the folder \"Internal Storage\" appearing on windows is empty.\nThere are also still photos and videos on the iPhone which are not on the external harddrive.\nWhat is going on?\nHow can I move all media from the iPhone to the external harddrive?!\nI also tried it via iTunes, but the \"synchronize\" field is grayed out even after restarting windows.\nI also tried to transfer all the files from iCloud to the computer, but there is a limit of 1000 Photos.\nSo I installed iCloud for Windows, but the software does not work. The sync is not triggered at all.\nUpdate: I figured out that I have to trigger the synch by clicking on the icon on the down right in the tray. Now I can synchronize the data between the computer and the iPhone\n\nA: I have had success with simply mounting and using File Explorer to locate the DCIM directory and copying it out.  However, I found it easiest to delete the photos from within the Photos app on the phone itself, despite how tedious that is.\nYou have to go into the Photos app, select the camera roll album, press 'Select' at the top right, and drag to select the photos you want to delete.  I recommend deleting in batches instead of trying to select them all in one go.  Unfortunately, this doesn't actually delete the photos, it just moves them to the 'Recently Deleted' folder.  Go to that folder, click 'Select' then 'Delete All'.\nYes it's tedious, but it works every time and I've gotten pretty fast at doing it.\n\nA: iCloud for Windows\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the software from Windows Store and sign in with the Apple ID photos are used with.\n\n*Open the options for photos and tick all the options which make original photos stored on the PC.\n\n*Go to Favourites in File Explorer and click download photos. Select all. Wait for the process to complete. \nTo remove photos from iPhone, turn off iCloud photo Library first. \nAssuming you have Download originals set in iPhone photos preferences, Go to iCloud settings and turn off Photos. This ensures that all the changes made in iPhone will not be reflected in iCloud photo library and thus not on the PC. \nDeleting on iPhone moves the photos in Recently Deleted and takes upto 30 days to delete if not done manually. \nNow go to iCloud for Windows where hopefully all the items are stored locally by now. Turning off photos as it was turned on as said above, will delete all the photos in iCloud, free up storage and only place where your photos are will be PC. \nApple Data Download\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://privacy.apple.com and sign in.\n\n*Request download for photos and videos or any other thing you want. \n\n*After being notified via mail, Get the compressed file and make sure that all the media is there. \nNow whether iCloud for photos is turned off or not, deleting photos from iPhone removes them from iCloud too. \niTunes\nTo resolve the issue, installing latest version from Windows Store  should help. Also Authorise the PC by going to Account Menu and entering the password on the prompt. If there's a prompt at iPhone while plugging in, tap \"Trust\".  If still persists, there is a long list of actions at Apple Support Article to troubleshoot iTunes not recognising iPhone etc. \n\n- I don't use windows so cannot answer about how to use usb cable to do the same.\n\n\n- There one more answer at Originals from iCloud photo library to pc  which uses python  script.\n\n\n- This question about transfer videos from iPhone to PC using cable had a bounty too. Answers suggest that Windows7 works perfectly, 10 doesn't. So this no longer remains a problem for Apple.SE.\n\n\nA: How to transfer photos from your iPhone or iPad using the Windows 10 Photos app\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can also use the Windows Photos app to import your photos. It can easily transfer your photos in bulk, and the app is very nice for looking at your pictures.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Install iTunes — this ensures your computer can communicate with your iPhone or iPad even if you don't specifically use iTunes to transfer files.\n  \n*Plug in your iPhone or iPad with your Lightning to USB or 30-pin Dock to USB cable.\n  \n*Launch the Photos app from your desktop, Start menu, or taskbar.\n  \n*Click Import — it is located at the top right of the window.\n  \n*Click any photos you'd like to not import. They will all be imported by default.\n  \n*Click Continue. Your photos will now be imported into the Photos app.\n  \n\nThe photos will be located in the Windows Pictures folder by default but you can move them into the external hard drive.\nHow to transfer photos from iPhone or iPad to Windows 10 using iCloud\nWindows 10 has the ability to use iCloud to wirelessly sync your photos as long as you've backed up the photos on your iPhone or iPad to iCloud. Here's how to do it.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Launch your favorite web browser from the Start menu, taskbar, or desktop.\n  \n*Navigate to the iCloud for Windows download site.\n  \n*Click Download.

You can set these options how you'd like, but\n  this ensures you're just getting the photos off your iPhone or iPad\n  onto your PC.\n  \n*Click Done.\n  \n*Click Apply. Any photos in your iCloud will now download to your PC.\n  \n\nThe photos will be located in the Windows Pictures\\iCloud\\Downloads folder by default but you can move them into the external hard drive.\nYou can find both iTunes and iCloud for Windows in the Windows 10 Store\nBoth steps provided by iMore. \n", "Q: 2018 Macbook Air hot/slow when using UHD monitor So I upgraded from a 1080p 27 inch monitor to the following\nSamsung 32\" UHD 4K Monitor\nModel: LU32J590UQNXZA\nI've tried connecting over HDMI using a USB C dock, and over Displayport with a Displayport to USB C cable.\nIn both cases if I'm doing anything graphic intensive, or even in a video call, my laptop gets hot quickly and starts stuttering to the point of the mouse and keyboard hesitating.\nAll I've read says the new macbook air should be able to handle a 4K monitor.  I mostly needed more screen real estate, not so much high resolution.\nAm I expecting too much of integrated graphics?  I'm not expecting to game on this laptop, but video calls become non-functional, and when I'm using Affinity Photo it also starts screeching to a halt even when working on small images.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my 2018 15\" Macbook Pro. The only thing that helps is  to set the scaling for the display not to the max screen real estate.\nIt's not getting warm or anything, but the interface is kind of laggy.  \n\nA: Par for the course, sadly. The more pixels that need pushing out, the harder the whole machine has to work, and the thinner the machine the less efficient the cooling.\n\nA: I went to the Apple store to get some diagnostics done.  When I plugged into one of the high end 4K LG monitors that had USB C built in it ran fine, even using Affinity Photo on high resolution projects.  My guess is the USB-C adapters I tried were only Thunderbolt 2 and not Thunderbolt 3 capable.  The hard part is getting honest/clear specs on the adapters, many claim to be Thunderbolt 3 but I'm guessing they really just mean it's the USB-C physical form but not actually capable of the data/power throughput.\n", "Q: How are phone calls initiated from iPad's FaceTime routed? An iPad is configured with the same Apple ID as an iPhone, which is configured to enable the iPad to receive / initiate phone calls.  \nIs the iPad directly communicating with T-Mobile's cellular gateway or is the iPhone an intermediary for the voice packets?\n\nA: Both can happen. Contact your carrier to see if they allow WiFi calling or need handoff to be present. \n", "Q: Why are Apple Watch activity rings moving on by themselves? I am observing my Apple Watch activity rings are moving insanely. I did talk to customer service they were also unable to help me. Did anyone face the issue before?\nWhat happened today?\n\n\n*\n\n*I wore the watch to the gym and started the Aaptiv app in my iPhone 7 Plus. In the workout I did use my workout app. \n\n*After the workout was over, I found the watch using aaptiv app by itself, no idea how and why?\nAnd my activity rings are increasing insanely.\n\n\nI did unpair and pair the watch. I uninstalled the aaptiv  app from Apple Watch. But still the problem persists.  I don’t know how to factory reset the watch. I did not try this option.\nHow can I stop the rings from increasing without any movement? \n\n\n\nA: Could be another app recording a workout automatically. \nCheck the Health app or the Workouts tab in the app you screenshotted, to see if you have any apps registering additional workouts in the background. \n", "Q: Select All in iOS Safari When selecting text in iOS, you get a \"Select, Select All, Speak Sentence\" popup as soon as you place the cursor. This doesn't seem to work in Safari where trying select something only brings up \"Copy, Define, Share\".\nSo how does one trigger \"Select All\" on a webpage shown in Safari?\n\n\nA: ‘Select, Select All, Speak Sentence’ are the options shown when there is no current selection. In your screenshot, a selection has been made, so the options change to be contextual to your selection, namely ‘Copy, Look Up, Share…’.\nYou can only bring up the first set of options without a selection, therefore this is only possible in a text input or textarea. You can make the entire page editable, thereby being able to place the cursor within without a selection, by running the following JavaScript in a Shortcut:\ndocument.body.contentEditable = \"true\";\n\n\n", "Q: Run macOS as guest VM OS within VMware Fusion Is it possible to install macOS as the guest OS within a VM in VMware Fusion?\nI am running macOS Mojave on a Mac mini (2018). I want to run virtual machines inside of which is running macOS Mojave or Catalina. I am not trying to run Microsoft Windows, not at all. \nParallels is unusable with macOS as the guest OS. So I need an alternative.\n\nA: Yes\nAccording to this product brochure page comparing the Fusion and Fusion Pro feature sets, there is an item listed that is checked for both editions:\n\nSupport for macOS Mojave Host and Guest\n\nI currently run Mojave as a guest OS in VMware Fusion version 11.1 on a Mac mini (2018) with 32 gigs of RAM running macOS Mojave 10.14.5 as the host OS.\n\nFusion offered to create a guest OS using the Recovery volume of the host Mojave. Unfortunately, when I chose that option it then reported an error saying I have no Recovery volume. (I doubt that, as Parallels did successfully make a macOS VM from my Recovery volume.) Anyways, I had Install macOS Mojave.app downloaded in my Applications folder. I dragged that into the Fusion \"new\" VM dialog box, and it worked to install macOS in the new VM.\nOn the upside, I have not seen the disappearing mouse pointer as was seen in Parallels as linked in the Question. On the downside, I have not yet been able to resize the virtual display in Fusion despite installing VMware Tools utility within the guest OS; the screen is stuck at 1024 x 768 resolution within the macOS guest OS. These virtualizers never run perfectly smoothly, it seems, there are always problems and limitations.\nTip: As a Parallels customer, you qualify for a discount if you decide to go with Fusion.\n", "Q: SSD drive partition showing as FFFF on my MacBook Pro 2010 About three years ago I replaced my original hard disk on my 2010 MacBook Pro with SSD drive to make the system run faster. It did work fine until now.\nRegrettably I'm in this position now as my system kept booting and when it turned on eventually it always started with a pop-up that report needs to be sent to Apple. It happened number of times and eventually it stopped booting altogether.\nI took the SSD hard disk out and started investigation and looking for answers in online forums. Sadly in my case the partition drive is/was my main macOS drive and has lots of family pictures and data.  Unfortunately I haven't got any back-up of all family pictures and data since I replaced it with original drive.\nMy SSD main partition drive is showing as 'FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF'. I’ve put the old original hard disk back and booted my macbook from it and connected SSD via USB and the main partition now showing as ' FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF'.\nAs I've been looking for a solution on how to fix and come across number of posts and I've read Klanomath’s solution posts resolving this issue.\nWhen you advise to run add gpt command there is usually a long string after that in your solutions, e.g.\nsudo gpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 820115416 -t 7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-0033…\n\nHow do you determine that? \nI’ve posted some pictures below.

I entered a Screen Time passcode, tested it and knew the code.  However, when I went back and selected \"Share Across Devices\", it reverted back to some other passcode that I don't know.  I know it wasn't a fluke because this happened across 2 different devices.  \nI've tried every previous passcode with no luck.  I know I can wipe the device with iTunes and start over but that presents difficulties in getting data back for saved games, etc.\nAnyone else seen this behavior or know a way around it? \n\nA: I can confirm this behavior. All of my devices (Mac OS and iPad OS) are getting an older screen time passcode, other than the one that I have configured on my iPhone for iOS 13.\nI spent a good chunk of my day with an Apple support engineer on Friday. In a screen sharing session I showed him the behavior on my mac and iPad. I set my screen time passcode on my iPhone to \"1234\", and enabled \"share across devices\". Then, on my mac, I enabled \"share across devices\" and it got a different passcode than 1234. It is a bug and the only work-around for now is to reset the screen time passcode on each device and NOT enable \"share across devices\".\nI sent them logs and have a follow up with them on Wednesday.\nIt is possible to reset the screen time code for Mac OS by signing out of iCloud in System Preferences, manually enabling screen time while NOT signed in to iCloud (this is important to prevent \"share across devices\" from getting auto-enabled), and then signing back in to iCloud. At this point, DO NOT CHECK \"share across devices\" in screen time settings as it will restore the old, unknown passcode.\nFor iOS 13, you can reset the screen time pass code by connecting your device to a Mac, making a local backup, and then clicking \"Restore iPhone...\" using said backup. Backups in iOS 13 do not contain the screen time passcode, and performing a \"Restore iPhone...\" operation completely wipes the device of all user settings and OS settings.\nFor iPad OS, I believe a similar approach will work but I have not tried it.\n", "Q: How long do Apple retain notifications to be pushed to iOS devices until they expire? If an app attempts to send a notification to an iOS device that is either powered off or has no network connectivity push notifications need to be kept in queue. \nFor how long does Apple retain notifications to allow the device time to contact the APNS servers?\n\nA: It depends on the service that sent the notification in the first place. The service (i.e. the backend system that supports an app such as Facebook or any other app) sends their notifications to Apple's push notification service over a HTTP/2-based API. In that API it sets a parameter known as \"apns-expiration\", which determines how long time Apple's push notification service will queue the notification to be delivered when the device is online again.\nThe \"apns-expiration\" parameter can be set to 0, which means that it won't be queued at all.\nIf set to a higher number than 0 that is the date and time (represented as the number of seconds since midnight on the 1st of January 1970 in UTC), the message will be removed from queued.\nFinally, the service can choose not to send the parameter at all, or send it as -1 (negative). This means it should be queued for as long as possible.\nThe maximium queue time is not infinite, but is chosen by Apple - and seemingly not documented anywhere. However, PC World described in 2009 that the maximum at that time was 28 days:\nhttps://www.pcworld.com/article/167652/the_limits_of_apples_push_notification_for_the_iphone.html\n\nA: What you are referring to is covered under Quality of Service component of Apple push notifications. It's addressed in the following linked Apple Developer documentation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local and Remote Notification Programming Guide - Quality of Service, Store-and-Forward, and Coalesced Notifications\n\nApple Push Notification service includes a Quality of Service (QoS) component that performs a store-and-forward function. If APNs attempts to deliver a notification and the destination device is offline, APNs stores the notification for a limited period of time and delivers it when the device becomes available again. This component stores only the most recent notification per device and per app. If a device is offline, sending a notification request targeting that device causes the previous request to be discarded. If a device remains offline for a long time, all its stored notifications in APNs are discarded.\n\nand\n\n\n*\n\n*Communicating with APNs - HTTP/2 Request to APNs\n\napns-expiration\nA UNIX epoch date expressed in seconds (UTC). This header identifies the date when the notification is no longer valid and can be discarded.\nIf this value is nonzero, APNs stores the notification and tries to deliver it at least once, repeating the attempt as needed if it is unable to deliver the notification the first time. If the value is 0, APNs treats the notification as if it expires immediately and does not store the notification or attempt to redeliver it.\n\n\nReferring the Local and Remote Notification Programming Guide should address your concerns related to Apple push notifications.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Parallels Desktop 14 - Aren't there drivers or kernel extensions too? When installing Parallels Desktop For Mac version 14.1.3, I was prompted for a password. I assume that means some kernel extensions or drivers were installed into macOS.\nThe official Uninstall Parallels Desktop for Mac page says simply to discard the Parallels app.\n➥ Does that mean some macOS alteration is left in place?\nAlso, according to this page there is some other stuff left behind as well.\n\nA: \nAren't there drivers or kernel extensions too?\n\nYes, apparently Parallels does use kernel extensions. \nIf in the Finder we select Parallels Desktop.app and context-click to choose Show package contents, we can navigate to nested folder Contents > Library > Extensions > 10.9 to find some .kext files such as prl_hypervisor.kext.\nAre such kernel extensions copied somewhere else upon installation?

My relative has an iPhone X, while I have both an iPhone 7, and a DSLR camera.\nAt a recent family event I compared his photos with mine and his iPhone X photos look almost as good as DSLR. I did a quick Google search but couldn't find an obvious answer.\nIs the most significant improvement hardware-based, or software-based? If it's the latter, can older iPhones be configured to get these benefits (I noticed his images are in HEIC format which my iPhone 7 only seems to use in Burst mode)? \n\nA: In addition to the answer offered by Nimesh, there's also the issue of how you compared the photos.\nMy assumption is that you were just checking them out on your iPhones, and this probably explains a lot of what you noticed because the display on an iPhone X is leaps and bounds above that used in an iPhone 7. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*the iPhone 7 incorporates a Retina HD LED-backlit LCD display with a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels\n\n*the iPhone X uses a Super Retina HD OLED display with a resolution of 2436 x 1125 pixels\n\n\nNot only is the iPhone X's resolution much higher, but it uses an OLED screen as opposed to an LCD one. Photos viewed on this will appear to look significantly better than those displayed on an LCD.\nIn other words, while the iPhone X is definitely taking better photos, how much better they're looking is exaggerated if you're viewing them on an OLED display, as opposed to viewing the photos on the same display.\nSo, for a valid comparison you'd need to view the photos from both devices on the same display (e.g. on the same computer) to get a better sense of how much difference there was in the quality. \n\nA: Assuming both the iPhones are running the same latest version of iOS.\n\nIs the most significant improvement hardware-based, or software-based?\n\nCertainly iPhone X, being a generation newer than iPhone 7 has better hardware. If you compare the camera specs for both the iPhones this is what you get:\n\nEssentially, the specs appear quite comparable. However, photo quality isn't just about megapixels, optics and sensors. What isn't obvious is that iPhone also employs computation photography in addition to relying on bare camera hardware.\nAdditionally, with better chip in iPhone X (A11 Bionic) with an addition of Neural Engine, compared to iPhone 7 (A10 Fusion), iPhone X is better equipped, hardware-wise to perform better computations (software) to give you better looking end results.\nIt's really a culmination of hardware and software that dictates what a device can produce.\n", "Q: How to force quit an app that doesn't show in the Force Quit Applications menu? I have an app running that is showing in my statusbar icon menu, but it's rainbowing - I can't click on it or interact with it in any way.\nThe same application doesn't show in my Force Quit Applications menu.\nWhat choices do I have?\n\nA: The Force Quit menu will only show foreground windowed applications, not all processes.  Launch Activity Monitor, and search for the name of the app, or look for processes marked in Red with \"Not Responding\". There is a Quit button in the toolbar, where you can choose to Force Quit a process. \nItems in the menubar are sometimes controlled by the SystemUIServer process, which may also need to be restarted.\n", "Q: How do I close only one Google Chrome window in macOS using mouse?

So I know about the procedure to de-activate the AMD GPU and activate the Intel GPU on the mainboard. This has to be done via the command line in Terminal, for which you need to start Recovery Mode and get into OSX Utilities and then start Terminal.\nUnfortunately, booting in Recovery mode ends before I get into OSX Utilities.

I remember in the olden days displays had a command line mode and graphics mode. \n(1) I'd try single use mode.\nThis page will tell you how to get into single user mode.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492\nBasically, you hold down the command + s key then power on your machine. [ The command key has a little apple symbol on the lower left. It is between the alt/option key and the space bar. ]\n(2) You could try safe mode.  This avoids using the graphics hardware. \nTry a safe boot.\n    Shutdown your machine.  Hold down the shift key.  Poweron.  The boot up will take longer than normal because the filesystem on the startup drive is being checked and repaired as needed.

The APFS partition container is already at the end of the drive. There is no significant amount of free space to add.\nThere is approximately200 GB of free space above the APFS container partition. The macOS operation system offers no command or application that would add any of this free space to the APFS container partition.\nThe easiest solution would be to backup you files, erase the drive, reinstall macOS and reload your files.\nAnother more complex solution would be to create a new APFS container partition above the existing APFS container partition. You could then either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install macOS in the new APFS container partition, then use the Migration Assistant to copy all your files and applications. I have used this solution before.\n\n\nOR\n\n\n*\n\n*Attempt to clone the old APFS container partition to the new APFS container partition. I have never tried this solution. Maybe some else could comment or post an answer.\n\n\nAfterwards, you could erase the old APFS container partition to create free space immediately after the new APFS container partition. You could then use the diskutil apfs resizeContainer command to add this new free space to the new APFS container partition\nCreating new APFS container partition would involve several steps. Some of these steps would have to be preformed while booted to macOS Recovery. You should backup your files before attempting these steps. However, once you have a backup, you might as well just erase the entire drive and reinstall macOS. If want me to include the steps to create a new APFS container partition, then post a comment.\nI should also note that you do not have a EFI partition on the drive. Since the identifier for the APFS Container disk1 is disk0s3, I assume the removal of this partition took place shortly before posting your question. Apple does state in the documentation, that an EFI partition is necessary for the proper operation of the Mac.\nHow to Create an EFI Partition\n\nNote: You should only proceed if you understand the steps given below. Otherwise, you may end up deleting your files.\n\nBecause of System Integrity Protection (SIP), you can not enter the commands in a Terminal window. You will first have to do one of the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to macOS Recovery which can install El Capitan or a newer version of macOS. Use the csrutil command to disable SIP, then boot back to macOS Mojave. You can then enter the commands in a Terminal application window.\n\n*Boot to the macOS Recovery that is already on your drive. You can then enter the commands in a Terminal application window.\n\n*Boot to the macOS Recovery over the internet which can install High Sierra or a newer version of macOS. You can then enter the commands in a Terminal application window.\n\n\nThe commands with explanation are given in the following steps. Here, I have assumed the device block size is 512 bytes. In other words, the command given below should return Device Block Size: 512 Bytes.\ndiskutil info disk0 | grep \"Device Block Size\" \n\nIf you get a device block size other than 512 bytes, then you can not use the commands given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac. The command given below should show the Apple_APFS container disk1 as disk0s1.\ndiskutil list\n\n\n*The command given below should create an unformatted EFI partition with the identifier of disk0s2\ngpt -f add -i 2 -b  40 -s 409600 -t efi disk0\n\n\n*The command given below should FAT32 format the new EFI partition and label new volume as EFI.\nnewfs_msdos -F 32 -v EFI /dev/disk0s2\n\n\n*Create a temporary unformatted partition between EFI partition and the Apple_APFS container disk1. The linux type was chosen to prevent the partition from mounting. This partition should be assigned the identifier of disk0s3.\ngpt -f add -i 3 -b 409640 -s 409600 -t linux disk0\n\n\n*Remove the temporary partition. The will reorder the partition entries in the GUID partition table (GPT) in ascending order.\ndiskutil erasevolume free none disk0s3\n\n\n*Restart the Mac. This will reorder the identifiers for disk0 in ascending order. You can enter the command given below to confirm this.\ndiskutil list\n\n", "Q: Access to ioreg using Python?

It allows you to call C/Objective C functions etc. from Python.\nYou can see an example of how to that with IOKit here:\nhttps://github.com/pudquick/pypmset/blob/master/pypmset.py\nIn addition you'll find that someone already creeated a wrapper for IOKit to be accessible from Python here:\nhttps://github.com/mosen/moobjc-framework-IOKit\n", "Q: MacBook Pro with two external monitors : one is flickering I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) version 10.14.5.\nA first monitor (DELL P2719HC) is connected through thunderbolt 3 while a second monitor (DELL E2313H) is connected through a VGA adapter. The latter is the one flickering!\nFlickering stops when I disconnect the first monitor. Thus, it's not a problem of the adapter, nor the screen. I am guessing this is due to my laptop not being able to give enough fps to both screens (they both require a 60Hz refresh rate at minimum, which I cannot change event with some command line tools).\nI tried to reset VRAM and SMC, but it did not work.\nWhat else can I do?\n\nA: This problem is not due to the computer not being able to serve the necessary amount of \"fps\". Instead this is a hardware problem.\nVGA is an analog signal. If the signal is distorted or interfered with, it could problems such as flickering. The flickering stops when you disconnect the first monitor - which indicates that this monitor (and cable) is the source of interference.\nI would suggest replacing the VGA cable with one with a ferrite bead instead. Another option is to replace the VGA adapter with a DVI adapter and connect to the monitor using a DVI cable.\nIf possible you could also try to the cables seperate from each other physically (i.e. get distance between them) - but it is difficult as they need to plug in to the computer very near each other.\n", "Q: How do I close window(s) in MAC without re-opening the window How do I close windows from dock or anywhere else without needing to open the window each time just to close it\nIf I have 10 windows opened(of the same application) and want to selectively close 7 of them belonging to the same app, is it possible to close them(without needing to re-opening those windows) by right clicking the app icon in the dock/mission control/App Expose/etc and then closing the ones I don't need? (I also have windows of other apps opened and I don't to want to navigate through them)\nRe-Opening each window and then clicking the close button(or a keyboard shortcut) seems to be too much work. Looks like a useful feature that is missing in MAC\n\nA: No, what you're asking is not natively possible.\nIn other words, an application's Dock Tile menu does not natively allow for closing individual windows the app has open.\n\nA: If you are looking for the fastest way to close several document windows within an application, then there are already plenty of better ways than using the Dock might provide.\nYou can cycle through open windows in one app with Command ` (this might vary in other keyboard layouts, but it's usually the key to the left of Z). You can close several documents in one application with a succession of Command W, using Command ` to flick past documents you want to keep open. I'd say that's much quicker than trying to close 7 of 10 in the Dock. If you get a prompt to Save or Don't Save, you can use Command S or Command D. \nYou can use the Application Windows function key to show all the windows of an application. Also Mission Control shows you all the windows of all apps.\nYou can close all documents of one app with Alt Command W, or by alt-clicking on any window's red dot. \nYou can also Minimize windows into the Dock, but I would advise against it. It's very easy to forget about what you've minimized, and you have to un-minimize before you can do anything else with the window. You can't use the window cycling shortcut above to access minimized windows.\n", "Q: Fixing Macbook Pro keyboard key The e key on my keyboard started to feel weird. After some attempts to clean it, I’ve decided to remove it and noticed the membrane is the middle was loose. I’ve only noticed this is atypical because the instructions I found on removing keys mentioned it should be held in place.\n\n\n\nAfter cleaning the key, it’s (considerably) better but not perfect, and I wonder if the loose membrane is to blame. Is there a safe way to fix it?\nBy “safe” I mean a method that is unlikely to break it. The key isn’t perfect but it is usable, so I won’t follow a method that risks breaking it, as I wouldn’t have the money to send it in for repairs.\nThis is an older retina Macbook Pro (late 2015 15-inch) with the scissors (not butterfly) switches.\n\nA: There's a good chance the loose membrane is to blame and affixing it in place would solve the issue. Before continuing, you can verify if the membrane is the issue or it's something else by powering the laptop on with the key and membrane removed, opening some kind of document on the computer, then using a toothpick or other small (non-sharp) object to push down the center location. If that regularly causes an e character (or whatever key is at issue) to be input in to the document, the keyboard electronics are in good shape.\nWith that done, try holding the membrane down (by its edges) in place over the switch location, while using your fingertip to depress the membrane in the center. You should see  e characters being emitted as before. This is the location you want to affix the membrane.\nAdditionally, double-check that the scissor-spring part of the key is in good shape. Grit or broken plastic in that part would also explain the key feeling off, so verify that it's in good shape before proceeding. (If it's not obvious, remove a working, known-good key and compare them.)\nPutting the Membrane in Place\nYou might not love this suggestion because of its permanence, but I think your best bet is using cyanoacrylate (super glue). I can't absolutely guarantee it won't harm the membrane, but I think it's very unlikely.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off the laptop.\n\n*Clean the area that you'll affix the membrane to: isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or acetone on a Q-tip should do the trick. You likely also want to clean the rubber membrane.\n\n*Run a small bead of cyanoacrylate around the outer edge of the membrane.\n\n*Carefully place the membrane in the centered location you found above when testing the keyboard. Gently hold in place for a minute or so until the super glue has set.\n\n*Wait for it to fully cure. Overnight should be enough, a day should be absolutely safe. This might be overkill, but it would really suck to bump it out of alignment by rushing this part. \n\n*Power the laptop on, test it out by gently depressing on center of membrane: it should register keystrokes like before when you tested the keyboard.\n\n*Reassemble the key, you're done!\n\n\nThe upside to the above approach is that it (should) result in a permanent fix. But that also makes it feel risky, because if something goes wrong, it's extremely difficult to undo. A modified approach would be to put the membrane down in place without cyanoacrylate on it, then carefully put a bead around the edge, touching the outer edge of membrane and the metal where you're affixing it. If it turns out things went bad, acetone (nail polish remover) can break down cyanoacrylate, so you could carefully undo the process with some Q-tips and patience. But I think this approach would be less strong and easier to mess up, even if it has the upside of being (semi-)reversible.\nAlso, be careful when you're using the cyanoacrylate that it doesn't drip down off the metal (I think it's metal, not 100% sure, whatever the cross bar the membrane/switch sits on) and into the area below. Keep some acetone and Q-tips handy in case you need to clean up any accidents quickly.\nFinally, I can't guarantee this will work and won't have an impact on the membrane -- I just don't know the exact chemical interaction. But I'm pretty sure you'll be okay and solidly affixing the membrane in place is the best chance of solving the issues you're seeing. But, you know, you follow instructions at your own risk, etc, etc.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I know your laptop does not qualify for the apple keyboard repair program but you might want to take it in anyway. I've spoken with a supervisor before and talked them in to some repairs that absolutely should not have been covered. With so many people having keyboard issues they might be willing to do something.\nAnother thought is pay to have the battery replaced.  I'm not sure if they replace the whole top or dissolve the epoxy holding the battery to the top.\n", "Q: Can i tell if i am being observed by an admin using apple remote desktop?

Unfortunately, it still produced numerals rather than spelled words in each case, as seen below using Gboard within the iOS Mail app:\n\n\nA: The answer is to install Google’s GBoard keyboard. Its voice dictation feature automatically spells out numbers like “forty-five” rather than typing them out as “45”. I don’t know why iOS doesn’t do this. I’ve tried, but ultimately it was Google to the rescue. It also works in other languages, i.e. French “quarante-cinq” and Spanish \"cuarenta y cinco”.\n", "Q: How do I insert the cursor after the last word (that is misspelled)? Latest iOS, using Safari.  I am often writing a post on SE and the last word I left off on is a misspelling.  For instance \n\n... so I definitely prefer QO to Homeline.  \n*\n\nThe misspelled word is jargon or a trade name.\nNow, I want to continue writing.  So I place the cursor at the asterisk above: the beginning of the next paragraph (I had hit new line twice after the misspelled word). Instead, it lights up the last word in red.  I cannot type because the word and new lines will be destroyed and I will be adding to the previous paragraph.  \nWhat is the proper way to put the cursor at the end of the word or the start of the next paragraph? \n\nA: Press on empty space after any text until a sort of magnifying glass appears over your finger.\nMove your finger to the cursor and keep going.  The cursor will follow you in the center of the magnifier.  When you get it where you want, let go.\n", "Q: iPhone not turning on, not responding to hard reset, not responding to charger About 2 days ago, my iPhone 6 decided to stop working. \nI tried to see what the error was but it decided not to respond to a charger, it would not respond to a hard reset or even when I tried to connect to iTunes. \nI took it into a repair store, and they said when they tried several different things, like replacing battery, LCD, and even screen, it would not turn on.\nI am getting a bit worried as there were a lot of important things that I had on that phone that cannot be recovered as they are specific to that phone and cannot be accessed anywhere else.\nPlease let me know any tips and anything I can do to try and make it work again.\n\nA: I would get a quote and send the device in to a microsoldering capable repair shop. These are highly specialized and not the typical, fix broken screen type shops.\nThey can and will fix liquid damage / no power on situations as well as make the system healthy enough in a lab setting to get you your data back and not spend even more money fixing it to run permanently.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.microsolderingrepairs.com/blog/iphonedatarecovery\nNo power / data recovery are generally less than $250 for non-liquid damaged phones and maybe double that if there is liquid damage / corrosion to be remediated.\nYou’ll possibly pay more than going to shops like you visited, but the more capable shops have much more expensive tools and skills and can recover data that’s far too gone for a place that specializes on the easy repairs. These sort of shops are generally less expensive than full blown data recovery shops, but you might get a couple quotes before sending it off - just be sure what diagnostic fee you owe and when you are charged if they do or don’t get your data back.\n\nA: I've had good luck storing the phone in a bag of rice for a few days.\nI've also sped up the process by putting it in the oven on 150 degrees for a bit.

I seem to remember that you could view the latest apps/games released in any category of the App Store. I used to love trying out new games and you could usually find a few gems that you otherwise wouldn’t be able to find.\nSo is there anyway of finding an true list of the latest released apps/games? And if there is, is there a way to find a list of latest releases within a certain category (such as the latest action games). The closest I could find is ‘new games we love’ in store and in the RSS feed. \nAlso I have seen a section in the App Store for ‘pre-orders’ but have never found the section since (it was one the main page of the App Store with the apps of the week etc) any ideas on how to find this again would also be a massive help!\n\nA: Apple doesn't show a list of new apps or games. However, you can use a third-party site like 148apps.com to view the newest apps.\n\nA: I found the only way is to buy the bundle from time to time and match for discrepancies\nhttps://42matters.com/app-market-data\nAnd what RSS feed did you mention?

Together you should decide if you should contact you employer's lawyers, Apple's legal department or both.  If you do not follow the rules, you put yourself and your employer at risk. I found the following quote on the macOS appstore:\n\nYou can install apps on every Mac authorized for your personal use\n\nhttps://www.apple.com/ca/osx/apps/app-store/\nRead the legalese:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/\nYou could contact apple legal.\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/contact/\nYou would need to logout from your work ID on your work computer and log back in with your personal ID.  You would download and install the software.  You would log out of your personal Apple ID then log back into your corporate Apple ID. To get updates, you would log out, log in and log out. \n", "Q: Missing Reminders since upgrade to Catalina beta I am using macOS 10.14.5 and all but one of my reminder lists have gone. \nI have macOS Catalina Beta installed on a separate testing partition and all my Reminders are there. But they don't appear on my main partition.\nIs there any way I can get them back?\nI don't have any iOS devices. And when I go to iCloud via the web, it just says Reminders coming soon. I tried restoring Reminders via iCloud on the web, but after the restore, they still aren't present on 10.14.5\nAny ideas?\n(Note: This question has also been posted here)\n\nA: Solution:\nGo to https://www.icloud.com/#settings\nYou can then select to restore Reminders. Restore back to the earliest date available and it will work again (Although you can no longer access them on iCloud via the web or any devices that have been upgraded to iOS 13/Catalina. Your restored Reminders will also no longer Sync with iOS 13/Catalina. See update below for workaround). \nThis will also cause Calendars to be restored, so before restoring, back up your calendars. You can also install a Google account on your Mac (Go to System Preferences > Accounts and enter your Google details) and copy your calendar events to the Google Account, which will keep them backed up.  \nUPDATE:\nIf you want to continue to use your Reminders and sync them between devices while still remaining on Mojave (or pre IOS 13), consider adding one of the following accounts to your devices. All these allow Reminders to continue to work after the upgrade even on Apple systems that cannot be upgraded to the new Reminders: \n\n\n*\n\n*Yahoo Account \n\n*AOL Account \n\n*Microsoft Exchange (you need an\norganization that provides Exchange accounts to do this, you cannot\nset one up yourself).\n\n\n(Obviously, if you add one of these 3 accounts, you need to add your reminders to these accounts (and not your iCloud account), but you can do that from within the Reminders App. It's really easy to move things between Apple accounts and these accounts, so in minutes you can have everything working again). \n\nA: The only thing that worked for me to recover them was:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Xcode simulator\n\n*run a iOS 12 device\n\n*login to iCloud inside the simulator\n\n*manually copy reminders from the simulator to the mac reminders app\n\n\nA: macOS Catalina and iOS 13 brings a completely rebuilt Reminders app, which requires a new database. On first launch of Reminders the database will be upgraded. Upgraded iCloud reminders cannot be viewed on devices running macOS prior to Catalina and iOS prior to 13. Currently, as both macOS Catalina and iOS 13 are in beta, upgraded reminders are not available on iCloud.com either.\n\nBe aware that many of the new features in Reminders require a format change that prevents syncing with other copies of Reminders running in Mojave and iOS 12.\n\n\nhttps://tidbits.com/2019/06/24/apple-releases-public-betas-of-macos-10-15-catalina-ios-13-ipados-13-and-tvos-13/\n", "Q: How to check if photos are already in Photos on MacOS? I have a rather large Photos library (> 100GB).\nI am in the process of tidying up a few USB hard drives containing, among others, a bunch of photos.\nHow to check which photos on these drives are already in Photos and can be safely deleted?\n\nA: If you don’t use iCloud to sync your library, it’s super easy to archive off a copy of your Photos database (in addition to your normal backup) and then just run the import and see how bad or good a job Photos does at not importing duplicates. \nMany situations, you’ll have a great import and be done.\nBefore I cared about the faces metadata, I did also validate you can detach the library from iCloud and then do an import like above, but now that I have my face data set up amongst my various iCloud synced devices, I am loath touch anything in iCloud relating to large changes in photos. (As that implementation is too opaque, fragile and lacks tools to fix in 2019 IMO)\nSo, for me, I would import the photos into a second library and then use the smart merge function or a third party tool Power Photos to avoid duplicates and keep the peace in my ~180 GB cloud synced library of photos. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/\nThis software is so powerful and worth it if you spend maybe a dozen hours a year cleaning duplicates or just love having a tidy library. There’s no harm in letting Photos try to import and detect duplicates if your time budget has tons of time to clean up and your money budget is tight, but I recommend a tool that’s designed to do a better job than Photos. \nThis tool will let you split your large library as well easily, so it has tons of features in addition to just merging. \n", "Q: Connect to a VPN server through a Raspberry (connected VPN client) I'm trying to connect from my MacBook to the VPN server, which is accessible from the Raspberry as it's a connected VPN client.\nMacBook (172.25.0.139) ---> Raspberry (172.25.0.14) ---> [INTERNET] ---> VPN Server (172.26.0.x)\n\nRaspberry is already connected to that VPN server, so I can reach it and connect to it via ssh FROM the raspberry.\nAs I'm connected to the same LAN than the raspberry, I'd guessed that it should be as simple as adding a route on my Mac to tell my MacBook that it should reach the\nVPN Server through the raspberry.\n✅ Raspberry connected to VPN server (172.26.0.99).\n✅ Raspberry is able to connect to the VPN server via ssh using the VPN LAN address (172.26.0.99)\n✅ MacBook (172.25.0.139) can connect to Raspberry (172.25.0.14).\n❌ MacBook (172.25.0.139) CANNOT connect to VPN server (172.26.0.99) THROUGH Raspberry (172.25.0.14).\nMacBook\nI set the route using networksetup\nnetworksetup -setadditionalroutes \"Wi-Fi\" 172.26.0.99 255.255.255.255 172.25.0.14\n\nI think I did it properly as I can see the tcpdump:\ntcpdump -n |grep 172.26.0.99\ntcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode\nlistening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes\n11:02:51.053672 IP 172.25.0.139.53549 > 172.26.0.99.22: Flags [S], seq 2856180432, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 6,nop,nop,TS val 718632786 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0\n11:02:52.058006 IP 172.25.0.139.53549 > 172.26.0.99.22: Flags [S], seq 2856180432, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 6,nop,nop,TS val 718633786 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0\n11:02:53.059068 IP 172.25.0.139.53549 > 172.26.0.99.22: Flags [S], seq 2856180432, win 65535, options [mss 1460,nop,wscale 6,nop,nop,TS val 718634786 ecr 0,sackOK,eol], length 0\n^C63 packets captured\n84 packets received by filter\n0 packets dropped by kernel\n\nRaspberry\n ✘ raspberrypi ✝ ~  netstat -nr -f inet\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface\n0.0.0.0         172.25.0.1      0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0\n169.254.1.0     169.254.1.13    255.255.255.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0\n169.254.1.13    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH        0 0          0 tun0\n172.25.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0\n172.26.0.0      169.254.1.13    255.255.255.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0\n\n ✘ raspberrypi ✝ ~  ssh 172.26.0.99\nLinux OpenVPN Host server 4.9.0-8-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.130-2 (2018-10-27) x86_64\nLast login: Tue Jul 16 11:50:01 2019 from 169.254.1.14\n user ✝ ~ ✅\n\n\nA: As @andrew-morozko suggested, Raspberry does not not redirect incoming packets to the vpn connection without configuration:\n  sudo iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING 1 -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE\n  sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i tun0 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n  sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i eth0 -o tun0 -j ACCEPT\n\n", "Q: How can I find what program is preventing my Mac from going to sleep? My Mac is set to go to sleep after 5 mins of inactivity, and typically this works fine. But every week or so I find that my Mac no longer goes to sleep and nothing I have tried stops this behavior.\nSo far I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*resetting the SMC and NVRAM a number of times\n\n*starting up in Safe Mode\n\n*checking that my Energy Saver settings have not changed (Sleep is still set at 5 mins and I have not opted to prevent the Mac from sleeping when the display is off)\n\n*quitting all running apps and using Force Quit to relaunch the Finder\n\n*updating all my programs to the latest versions\n\n*updating macOS to the latest version (currently macOS Mojave 10.14.5)\n\n\nI have never installed anything to prevent sleep.\nThe only course of action that works is a full restart, which is highly inconvenient.\nHow do I work out what program is stopping my Mac from sleeping?\n\nA: You’ve done a pretty good job so far of troubleshooting this yourself and there are many things that prevent sleep out of the box and by design.\nWhat I would do next is exactly what you’re asking about - a targeted check to see if an application is what’s stopping your Mac from going to sleep.\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n*\n\n*The next time your Mac isn’t going to sleep, open Activity Monitor\n\n*Click on the Energy tab\n\n*Now you’ll see a list of applications with a number of columns, one of which should be headed “Preventing Sleep”\n\n*Now check to see if any applications have a “Yes” listed in this column\n\nIMPORTANT: If an application has an expansion triangle to the left of its name, make sure you expand it to confirm whether anything is preventing your Mac from going to sleep. For example, web browsers such as Safari often have multiple windows/tabs open and one of these could be preventing your Mac from going to sleep. However, this will not be obvious unless you click on the expansion triangle.\n\n\n*If so, you can force them to Quit by selecting them and pressing optioncommandQ\n\n*Now wait to see if your Mac will go to sleep\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*If you don’t see a “Preventing Sleep” column at Step 3, then go to View > Columns > Preventing Sleep to display it.\n\n*If no applications are listed as preventing sleep, then let me know via the comment box below and we'll proceed with other steps.\n\nFor people that like command line options - there is an assertions log that shows what is going on - things that make the Mac think you are active, things that will block sleep, etc...\npmset -g assertions\n\nThis is the same information that the activity monitor shows, just more detail and you can see items come and go by letting the log run:\npmset -g assertionslog\n\nOne nice thing about command line is you can ignore everything that doesn't have \"sleep\" in it:\npmset -g assertionslog|grep -i sleep\n\n", "Q: applescript CURL with authentication fails QUESTION: i need a working method to be used in applescript to get the right source of the page, WITHOUT loading the page.\nsample link: https://www.idealista.it/immobile/16679597/\nresult: wrong html, it talks about authentication.\nINITIAL CODE (always present for all the tries below):\nset MyUser to username@dom.com\nset MyPass to password\nset UrlOfPage to \"https://www.idealista.it/immobile/16679597/\"\n\nTRIES (all of the tries below are given in this webpage https://ec.haxx.se/http-auth.html):\n\n\n*\n\n*works but need the page to be loaded in Safari\ntell front document of application \"Safari\" to set StrHtml to (get source) as string\n\n\n*returns wrong html\nset StrHtml to (do shell script \"curl --user \" & MyUser & \":\" & MyPass & \" \" & UrlOfPage)\n\nset StrHtml to (do shell script \"curl --anyauth --user \" & MyUser & \":\" & MyPass & \" \" & UrlOfPage)\n\nset StrHtml to (do shell script \"curl --digest --user \" & MyUser & \":\" & MyPass & \" \" & cellurl)\n\nset StrHtml to (do shell script \"curl --negotiate --user \" & MyUser & \":\" & MyPass & \" \" & cellurl)\n\nset StrHtml to (do shell script \"curl --ntlm --user \" & MyUser & \":\" & MyPass & \" \" & cellurl)\n\n\n*doesn't work: unknown token\nset StrHtml to (do shell script \"curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user \" & MyUser & \":\" & MyPass & \" https://www.idealista.it/immobile/16679597/ \\ --proxy https://proxy.idealista.it/immobile/16679597:80/\")\n\ncould somebody help me now please?\n\nA: Dedicated Tools\nGiven the problems encountered with curl and AppleScript, consider using an alternative dedicated tool such as Beautiful Soup.

APFS local snapshots are generally a pain for me, especially on some of my systems with small internal drives. All of my systems have Time Machine backups and the hourly backups it performs are more than sufficient for my needs.\nIs there any way to disable just local snapshots and keep Time Machine backups running?\n\nA: With macOS 10.14, it appears not to be possible to disable local snapshots.\nYou can remove local snapshots using a method documented in Apple's About Time Machine local snapshots support document:\n\nHow local snapshots use storage space\nYou don't need to think about how much storage space local snapshots are using, because they don't use space needed for tasks like downloading files, copying files, or installing new software.\nYour Mac counts the space used by snapshots as available storage. Even so, Time Machine stores snapshots only on disks that have plenty of free space, and it automatically deletes snapshots as they age or as space is needed for other things.\nIf you want to delete local snapshots manually, turn off Time Machine temporarily:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open Time Machine preferences from the Time Machine menu  in the menu bar. Or choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, then click Time Machine.\n  \n*Deselect \"Back Up Automatically\" or click the Off/On switch, depending on what you see in Time Machine preferences.\n  \n*Wait a few minutes to allow the local snapshots to be deleted. Then turn on Time Machine again. It remembers your backup disks.\n  \n\nSee also the Apple forum discussion Disable local snapshots in High Sierra with APFS.\n\nA: This is part of Time Machine, not APFS.  Using Time Machine is going to create a local snapshot for 24 hours and on other occasions.\nSee: About Time Machine local snapshots for more information from Apple.\nShort of using another backup program that does not take local snapshots everything else is sort of a hack.\nYou may want to try automating deleting local snapshots using a shell script triggered by automator.\nSee: How to use Time Machine local snapshots to recover data on your Mac in 2019\n", "Q: Parition disapeared after deleting Linux I had a 70gig partition running Ubuntu that I deleted from Disk utility (was gonna reinstall with Kubuntu instead).

I tried to repair it from recovery mode, but it keeps telling me to open first aid in recovery mode (which I am).\n\nA: If I'm understanding you correctly, you are trying to format a linux partition from your OS X diskutil app. Far better would be to access it via an external linux boot device, either USB or DVD. Since what you do to that partition as far as a reinstall of linux should (fingers crossed) only mess with the linux partition, your ability to later on reboot into OS X should be (fingers crossed) fine. As I am finding out myself, deleting partitions within one or the other systems may well befoul everything. But reinstalling to one of them should have less risk involved. BACKING UP the OS X partition first would be a stellar idea.\nI say this as someone running a MacBook late-2011 15\" with Mint Linux as first partition and MacOS as second. \n", "Q: Do all Magsafe adapters have removable extension cables? I have a 60W MagSafe charger (2012 Macbook Pro) and am wondering if the extension cord is removable so that I can just plug the actual \"brick\" into the wall with a fitted adapter? It doesn't seem like it's removable, so don't want to apply too much force - but would be neat if it is!\n\nA: Yes. All Apple MagSafe adapters have universal / interchangeable connectors where you can use your preferred length and polarity and groundedness connecter of regional preference to mains power.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD837AM/A/apple-world-travel-adapter-kit\n\nThe internal connector is standard IEC C5 or C7, and Apple adapters connect to the metal earthing pin optionally based on the cord or adapter chosen.

The removal is quite linear with not a lot of play so hopefully you don’t have to break things to get it apart.\n", "Q: How do I transfer files fast over two network shares? I have two shares (A, B) on the same volume on a synology NAS. I'm have the two shares mounted in finder, but when copying or moving files it takes forever, even with SMB3 on. I can of course use Synology's file browser which takes seconds, but the issue is that I can't easly open and preview files - I would like to use Finder if possible or at least an app for Mac that would allow me to open the files.\n\nA: Moving files from one share on a host to another share on the same host will always be faster when initiated from the host itself, and will always be slow when transferred from the host to a client (and back).  Regardless of whether you use Finder, or mv or cp or Carbon Copy Cloner, if the data has to traverse the network, it will be orders of magnitude slower.\nThere are some technologies that allow a copy or duplicate command on the same share to be initiated by a client and performed server-side instead of copying the whole file down to the client and then back.  I believe SMB supports this, but it it won't work across different shares, even if they're on the same host.\nLong story short, your network will always be the bottleneck compared to the disk controller's native speed (~88MBps for Gigabit Ethernet vs. 200-600MBps for SATA). If you're running 100Base-T on your network instead of Gigabit, you'll be 10x slower than that (8MBps).\nTo (pre)view anything on the Mac, you'll always have to transfer it (or enough of it) to the Mac over the network.  For large items, I'd recommend using the Synology's interface to move or copy items between the different shares.\n\nA: From my experience, Carbon Copy Cloner as a rsync gui makes better use of the bandwidth available compared to copying using the Finder's drag and drop. If you don't want to use the NAS interface, that's the only way to maximize the transfer rate. \nI will also suggest using Menumeters to measure your network speeds, and use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wifi if this is applicable.\n\nA: I'm not exactly sure if this is what you need but you may be able to use either the 'scp' command for remote transfers or the 'cp' command for local transfers.\ncp /Volume/share/path1/* /Volume/share/path2\n\nUse * to copy the entire contents of the folder.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2015 continuously powered on I have a Macbook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015).\nAs it is slowly aging, I'm starting to consider leaving it continuously powered on.\nCurrently it stays most of the day powered on, for about the past six months.\nRecently I noticed that its bottom is slightly bent. I have used it carefully through all of its life, taking good care not to over expose it to high temperatures.\nDoes leaving it continuously powered on entail any risk of catastrophic explosion, or further bending?\n\nA: This is in almost all cases caused by the battery swelling up and thus \"bending\" the case. The case expansion cannot in itself be caused by \"overuse of fans\".\nYou need to have your battery checked and replaced - don't wait with it. It is caused by a defective battery that swells up, and potentially could lead to a dangerous situation (such as causing a fire) if left unattended. This can happen not only when the computer is plugged in and powered - but also when the computer is turned off and not powered by an external power source!\nRemember that the battery is a wearing part, and yours is probably 4+ years by now.\n", "Q: Apple Books on Mojave stuck I launched Apple Books on my 2016 MacBook Pro (10.14.5) to continue reading some book I had started on my iPad Pro (where it was purchased). \nAs expected the book was in the cloud so I double clicked its cover to download it.

Unlike in the other glitch, I can use the tab key as well.  \nAny ideas on how I can troubleshoot this?\n\nA: This is a puzzler and at first I was thinking, \"wonky keyboard or keyboard controller.\"\nBut before I go blaming hardware it would be best to see if the issue is related to software.\nMost, if not all, keyboard customizations are done on a user by user basis and if they are not set in System Preferences they would be set by something that ran at login or startup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your Mac while holding the ⇧ Shift key. When you see the Apple logo you can release the key. Startup may take a lot longer. If that fixes the issue there is something installed that is causing the issue. If nothing changes...\n\n*Create another user. Log in as that user. Still have the problem? Hopefully not. If not then there is something in your user profile messing with your keyboard. You can start deleting/moving/etc. preference files and the like, but I would be inclined to just migrate your files to the new profile and delete the old one.\n\n\nNeither one of these worked?

If it goes to sleep it takes 5 days to turn back on.  \nJust a suggestion... what if you turn off sleep in System Preferences -> Energy Saver?  I'm interested if it does the same thing if it stays on but just goes dead.\nI would also try a fresh OS install either from a thumb drive or internet recovery in case something in the OS is causing the issue.  It's easy and you can reproduce the issue quickly so its something to cross off the list pretty fast.\nI assume you tried the obvious SMC, PRAM resets, etc... SMC controls a lot of the hardware so that's the one I would think is most likely.\nOnce I had a MacBook that had a bad thermal sensor.  It would turn itself off and take a few hours to turn back on but that was pretty obvious that it was hot and overheating so I would assume that is not the case here.  If it is getting hot then keep that in mind.  Also the MacStore replaced the motherboard and that did not fix the issue so they replaced the whole laptop.  I am not sure what the actual fix would have been.\nCleanMyMac has thermal warnings that can tell you if its overheating.  This may also tell you if you have a bad thermal sensor.  If you just turned it on and it's reading 100c then there is something wrong.\nLet us know if it may be overheating or if just plain going dead works and it's only sleep mode that does this.\nEdit:  This stood out in an article about overheating...\n\n\n*Fake MacBook Charger\nA normal charger for a MacBook Pro includes three main parts: AC power cord, MagSafe Power Adapter, and MagSafe connector.

TL;DR I need to recover lost files from an SSD but don't have the time to do it right now. How can I clone an SSD to another drive on byte level, including drive areas which the OS thinks are free?\n\nI did a cut and paste (Comd+C then Comd+Opt+V) on my Mac 10.14’s Finder to move some .mov files from my internal SSD to my WD My Passport External Harddrive (connected by USB 3.0 with a USB-C to USB adapter. My 15-inch Macbook is the 2018 version which only has USB-C ports, and has the touch bar).\nAlas, after a while, I move my Macbook and the connected got unstable, and was eventually lost. To my horror, when I tried to do a transfer again, I see that some files are greyed out on my external WD harddrive (see screenshot), and these files are no more on the original folder on my internal SSD!\n\n\nI tried to recover these files by using the following software on my SSD (**but not on the external hard drive yet) to no avail:\nDisk Drill\nFile Salvage\nEaseUS Data Recovery\nTechtool Pro 11 \n**I ran the software immediately after discovering the issue, because I know that if I continued using the Macbook, there would be risk that the OS would overwrite my files.\nCan someone tell me:\n(a) I am so tired of doing all this recovery, and want to move on to something else. But I need to use my Macbook! If I use it, I will definitely overwrite the lost files’ bytes one day. Can I do a byte-for-byte clone of the SSD to somewhere and work on this recovery issue some other time?\n(b) If yes, what software should I use and how do I make sure that the clone is both byte-for-byte AND it includes the parts of the SSD that are now seen by the OS as “free” (since that’s probably where the lost files reside?)\n(c) For (b), prefer software that can also show me the bytes in hexadecimal so I can inspect manually to see if it’s really byte for byte.\nP.S.: For more context, see: Data loss due to lost connection when transferring from Mac 10.14 SSD to External HDD\nP.S.: the SSD I am looking to clone is 256GB\n\nA: My favorite tool for that is the \"dd\" command that comes with macOS. It needs to be used from the Terminal, so if that puts you off - there are also GUI alternatives.\n\"dd\" is quite simple and will copy all data - including \"free\" areas. You take a clone by first rebooting your computer into Recovery mode.\nThen mount an external drive where you want to store the backup - make sure it has enough free space to contain the full size of the original drive. \nOpen Disk Utility to find the device name of your original drive. This is probably something like /dev/disk1s1 or similar. Also, if your original drive has been mounted for some reason while in Recovery mode - unmount it from Disk Utility.\nThen open Terminal and run a command like this:\ndd if=/dev/rdisk1s1 of=/Volumes/ExternalDrive/clone.img bs=1m\n\nNote that I put an \"r\" in front of disk1s1 - this bypasses buffers to make the transfer faster.\nAlso note that the output file name is specified as /Volumes/ExternalDrive/clone.img. You'll want to replace \"ExternalDrive\" with the name of your own externally connected drive.\nThe last part of the command bs=1m means to copy in block sizes of 1 megabyte. This just speeds up the operation.\n", "Q: Macbook Air without Sound, and missing Input/Ouput device options I have an up-to-date Macbook Air on which the sound no longer works.\nI had installed Soundflowerbed on it, and for a long time everything was working fine until a couple of weeks ago when it started to not work after a while.\nThen it stopped completely.\nI uninstalled Soundflowerbed, reset using:\n\n\n*\n\n*command + alt + P + R, and\n\n*shift + ctrl + alt\nbut, still the sound does not work.\nThe Sound devices view look like this:\n\nand, the input devices:\n\n\nWhat can I do to get the sound back?

Could someone please clarify what the following values under System Report > USB mean. I am using an iMac 5K 2019\n\n\n*\n\n*Current Available\n\n*Current Required\n\n*Extra Operating Current\n\n*Sleep current\n\n\nAlso, what is the maximum power output on this machine on USB-C and USB-A?\n\nA: The USB section of the System Report actually provides data for each of the USB devices connected to your Mac.\nThe information you're asking about relates to each of those devices. More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Current Available is the standard amount of power (in milliamps) provided by the specific USB port\n\n*Current Required is the amount of power (in milliamps) needed by whatever you have plugged into that USB port - if nothing, it should display 0 (i.e. zero)\n\n*Extra Operating Current refers to a special feature that Apple Macs support in relation to other Apple devices whereby under the right circumstances they can provide additional power (i.e. above the standard amount) to those connected devices. The right circumstances are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Mac must be running and booted into macOS (i.e. not booted into another operating system)\n\n*The Mac must be awake (i.e. not in sleep mode)\n\n*The connected device must be manufactured by Apple (I'm not aware of an exhaustive list anywhere, but typically the device is an iPod, iPhone or iPad)\n\n*The connected device actually requires the extra power for some reason (i.e. the Mac does not provide the extra power unless the device actually requires it)\n\n\n\nAs far as the maximum power output available, this depends. By default the USB 3 ports of your iMac (the ones you're referring to as USB-A) offer up to 900mA. However, for this to occur you must be using a USB 3 cable. If a USB 2 cable is being used it will limit the available power current to 500mA. And, as mentioned above, the amount of power offered in the case of some connected Apple devices can exceed these figures under the right circumstances.\nAs for the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, these can supply 15W of power per port to external devices. They can even be used for charging MacBooks (although they're not intended for that purpose and it's not something I'd recommend, plus the rate of charge will be quite slow).\n[UPDATE]\nBelow is some further reading from Apple's website that you may find relevant:\n\n\n*\n\n*If a Mac accessory needs more power or is using too much power\n\n*Using USB devices with your Mac\n\n*About the external features and ports on iMac computers introduced in 2017 or later\n", "Q: Removing connected servers from sidebar The Macs that I admin all have Home Shares mapped (via AD - Force UNC path) and are appearing in the dock.\nHowever I need to get rid of the root folder that appears in the sidebar of Finder once the home shares have been connected.

I did a cut and paste (Comd+C then Comd+Opt+V) on my Mac 10.14’s Finder to move some .mov files from my internal SSD to my WD My Passport External Harddrive.\nAlas, after a while, I move my Macbook and the connected got unstable, and was eventually lost. To my horror, when I tried to do a transfer again, I see that some files are greyed out on my external WD harddrive (see screenshot), and these files are no more on the original folder on my internal SSD!\n\n\nI tried to recover the files with several recovery applications but this only recovered some files originally from Trash. \nIs moving data by Cut&Paste different from copying and deleting? Or what could be the explanation that these files seem to be lost between the drives?\n\nA: Moving by cut & paste is not really that different from copying and deleting, no.\nThe explanation for the data loss is buffering. When you ask Finder to cut & paste (or copy and delete - doesn't matter) - all that Finder does it ask the operating system to copy data to the external drive and delete the file from the internal drive.\nThe operating system then asks the external data to write data to disk. Unfortunately that is quite slow - so if this was done naively, you would have to be sitting waiting for a long time not being able to use your computer for other stuff.\nThis is why operating systems for decades have implemented buffering and asynchronous I/O. This means that the data from your SSD is really moved into memory (RAM), and then slowly transferred to the external drive as its speed allows. From the user interface perspective, the operation has completed and you're free to do other stuff.\nThe problem is that if you then disconnect the disk without unmounting, the data wasn't really saved to the disk yet. In practical what happens is that the data is simply lost. \nTo make matters worse this can also happen at other levels - i.e. the external disk itself might also have buffers and caches - and if power is unexpectedly cut before things are saved to permanent storage - it is lost.\nThis is why you always need to unmount disks from the Finder before unplugging them from the computer. Unmounting takes as long as it takes to write everything out to permanent storage and be certain that it is really stored as it should. So when the disk is unmounted, you're free to disconnect it.\nThere's really no way of recovering the data that was lost this way from the external drive - as it really never touched that drive. If you need to do recovery, you'll need to do it on the internal SSD. \nThe chances of recovery here are much better as usually when you delete a file, you're not overwriting or \"deleting\" the actual data - instead you're just \"marking\" it as deleted in the file system. However, if you kept using the SSD for other stuff, eventually your files will be overwritten and the data permanently lost.\n", "Q: Apple Configurator 2 version and blueprints If I upgrade from version 2.3 of the Apple configurator 2 to the newest version will my be blueprints disappear? \n\nA: No they won't.

Later, I checked that this file has the following content:\n/net/us.e-fax.org/nfs/Documents\n\nThis has created an Archived.app in the root folder /net/us.e-fax.org/nfs/Documents which I can access from my browser. Now I am a little bit scared that it might be some sort of spyware/keylogger or something which can read my files etc. I have tried to remove the folder us.e-fax.org in the /net folder but I was only able to remove it by unmounting the /net folder. How can I clean my system from this pest?\n\nA: This sounds like someone's trying to use the same security bypass as OSX/Linker (Intego, ZDNet). It's a bug in Gatekeeper originally discovered by Filippo Cavallarin. The way it works is that if you access /net/<someservername>/<somepath>, macOS will automatically mount that server via NFS and give you direct access to files stored there. Unlike most forms of network download, any files you get this way are not considered quarantined, and thus don't have the usual security checks macOS applies to downloaded files.\nFirst step: delete the zip file and whatever it expanded into.\nSecond step: unmount the remote volume with sudo umount /net/us.e-fax.org/nfs/Documents. It sounds like you've already unmounted the entire /net` directory though, which should take care of this (and shouldn't cause any other trouble).\nThird step: I checked Archived.app, and it's currently just an empty shell. But its modification time is just a couple of hours ago, so it could easily have had malicious contents earlier, and the trickery the zip file used to mount it might also have been used to launch it. So... we have no idea what (if anything) it might've done to your computer.\nSo, you need to scan your Mac for any malware it might've installed. You can get Intego VirusBarrier Scanner from the Mac App Store, and Malwarebytes scanner here. Since I have no idea what (if anything) it did, I can't make specific recommendations.\nFourth step (optional, see the \"Potential mitigations\" part of the Intego article): you can disable the automount mechanism that made this bypass possible by editing the file /etc/auto_master in a text editor (I recommend BBEdit -- it's great for this sort of thing even in free/demo mode), and adding \"#\" at the beginning of the line that starts with \"/net\". You can do this from Terminal with the command:\nsudo sed -i.orig 's@^/net@#/net@' /etc/auto_master\n\nBe sure to copy this command exactly; any typos (including even just the wrong kind of quotation marks) could cause trouble. Note that it'll prompt you for your admin password, but the password will not show as you type it.\n", "Q: Prevent files in a folder from being moved? On a Mac, is there a way to prevent files in a folder X from being moved by any means (by the Comd+C then Comd+Opt+V on Finder, or by mv command on the command line, or by other apps etc.) to another folder Y, but still allow files to be written/added to the folder X, and still allow files to be copied from the folder X?\nIf needed, please answer specific to Mac 10.11 to 10.14, and take into account both HFS+ and APFS file systems.\n\nA: You can use Access Control Lists for this. Run\nchmod +a \"USERID:deny:delete_child\" DIRECTORY\n\nto prevent the user USERID from deleting anything from the directory.

I want to set the terminal tab name from the command line.  I am using this command to update the name echo -en \"\\033]0; New Name \\007\".  Here is what my terminal now looks like.  \n\nWhen I use the Inspector through GUI, I have the ability to set the terminal name and the tab name.  When I set it via the GUI, here is what I see.\n\nAs you can see there isn't any dashes - or text  on the tab.  How do I do this from the command line?\n\nA: TLDR\nYou can do this with something like echo -en \"\\033]1; New Name \\007\" or printf '\\e]1;%s\\a' 'New Name'. You may have to fiddle with your profile's window/tab title settings, though.\nExplanation...\nThis behavior is a little complex and not well explained I guess.\nTitle types\nFirst, you can set two types of title. Terminal.app calls these the tab title (aka the icon name/title) and the window title (as you can see in the inspector).\nThe XTERM escape sequences for setting these are:\n\n*\n\n*ESC]0;stringBEL -- Set icon name and window title to string\n\n*ESC]1;stringBEL -- Set icon name to string\n\n*ESC]2;stringBEL -- Set window title to string\n\nI'm not sure how common this behavior is across terminal emulators, but Terminal.app doesn't actually do what 0 describes here. It sets the window title, and clears the tab title (probably because, as I'll show later, Terminal will pick up the window title if the tab title is unset).\nThe reason you see different behavior is because your command is setting the window title, but in the inspector you're setting the tab title.\nTerminal.app title features\nThe dashes in the title are just separators that Terminal.app is using whenever it's combining multiple pieces of information in your title. (Pieces here include the profile \"tab\" and \"window\" Title options, as well as the window and tab titles themselves)\nIf you set both a window title and a tab title, it'll use them both. With multiple tabs, it'll separate them:\nIf the tab is in it's own window, though, it'll combine them and show the separator (unless you use the view menu to force it to show the tab bar even with a single tab):\nYou can still get it to show a single title, but you'll have to use only the window or the tab title (the window title will pick up the tab title if no windows title is set):\nThe inverse (tabs can pick up a window title if no tab title is set) is also roughly true, but the behavior can be a little surprising. Here are the same tabs in two windows along with the settings panel (to show that it's set to show the TTY name, but not to show items when there's a custom title): \nThe top window is picking up the default \"Terminal\" title because the current tab doesn't have a window title. Its tab doesn't show the TTY, because it has a custom tab title. The bottom window shows that the tab will pick up the window title if it doesn't have a tab title. The TTY shows up in the tab title because it doesn't have a custom tab title--just a custom window title.\n", "Q: Cycle through pair of spaces for two screens with one keyboard shortcut I have two displays and created for each display with Mission Control several desktops (also known as Spaces):\nDisplay 1: Desktops 1-5\nDisplay 2: Desktops 6-10\nI have following related settings adjusted\n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled: Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use\n\n*Enabled: Displays have separate Spaces\n\n\nI want to treat the desktops of each display as 5 pairs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktops 1,6\n\n*Desktops 2,7\n\n*Desktops 3,8\n\n*Desktops 4,9\n\n*Desktops 5,10\n\n\nI have already changed the keyboard shortcuts as following (from here):\n\nThis works fine after I have deleted ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist.\nHow can I cycle through the pairs of desktops with one keyboard shortcut, e.g. ctrl-left/right?\nI am actually testing Amethyst and want to use mod1+n/p (mod1=ctrl+shift).

Thanks to the instructions of Nimesh Neema, I have successfully disabled the AMD GPU and enabled the onboard Intel GPU. Fantastic!\nNext I rebooted my MBP about 6 times, and all was working and normal. When I unplugged the power cable to move the MBP to another location, the screen went black. Touching any keyboard button or the power button, did not reactivate the screen.

But the screen is terrible with these lines.\nDoes anyone recognize this?\nIs this a malfunction of the Intel GPU?\nWhat can I do?\n\n\nA: Does it do this on an external screen?

Leave the blank Finder window open, and go make yourself a nice cup of hot coffee/tea/chocolate. When you come back, the files should be there. Should you need to open a subfolder, be prepared for the possibility of another long wait.\nIf ten minutes sounds like an excessively long time, well, yes it is. While it's cool that Finder natively supports FTP connections, it is in practice an exceptionally poor FTP client.\n\nP.S. I chose ten minutes somewhat arbitrarily as a maximum time limit. It's not a magic number.\nP.P.S. To be fair to Apple, not all servers are this slow. But it's not unusual at all.\n\nA: I tried the example you gave: ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/\nI connected as a guest user. The delay was 12 seconds before seeing the directory listing.

I've been scratching my brain on this one for a while. In macOS, it's easy to add tags to a file (whether right-clicking on a file, using the toolbar shortcut button or using the File menu).

It's equally easy to remove any currently assigned tags.\nHowever, I can't find a way to replace all existing tags with a new one.

I assumed that holding down the Option key (or another modifier) may change the \"Add Tag\" action to a \"Replace Tag\" action, but no success.\nI know I could achieve this with Terminal Scripting or Keyboard Maestro, but I'm trying to see if there's a native way to do this.\nThanks!\n\nA: A native solution:\n\n*\n\n*Define a custom keyboard shortcut for the Finder.app in Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts. Map the menu item “Tags…” to some keyboard shortcut, I used ⌘ CommandS.\n\n*Now, selecting any file and hitting ⌘ CommandS brings up a little window where you can enter your tags.\n\n\n*⌘ CommandA selects all existing tags, you can then write your new tags and confirm with enter.\n\nThis means you can replace all tags of a file with “Important” by typing ⌘ CommandS, ⌘ CommandA, “Important”, ⏎ Return, ⏎ Return.\nThe window also does completion of tags, so a (case-insensitive) unique prefix of the desired tag name is enough.\n", "Q: Sophos AV always runs double instances of it's app. How do I just have 1 running? I run Sophos Anti-Virus on macOS Mojave and it always runs two instances of the app. It has 2 menu bar icons and it runs as 2 separate processes.

You need to move or remove some of the software on your disk drive. If you don't have another backup disk connected then maybe you can remove apps you bought from App Store and load them back after you get your system loaded. \nYou can run df -h from the command line and see what percent full your drive is. If you have about 50 GB free that is 20% of your 250 GB drive so your drive should be only 80%.\nYou can set up iCloud by going to System Preferences and selecting iCloud.

One of my favorite Mac apps, DiskWarrior, has been waiting for the APFS format documentation (also called the APFS volume specification) for a while, in order to make a new program version which can rebuild APFS disks. Recently, according their page linked above, this documentation was released and Alsoft is using it to update DiskWarrior. I would like to look at this documentation myself, as I find it interesting. However, I can't find the documentation anywhere. I've found a few documents like this, but I don't think that's what I'm looking for, since that document is not as comprehensive as what I would expect from a full volume format specification.\nDo I need a certain Apple subscription to see this documentation or am I simply failing at googling for it?\n\nA: I think Alsoft's use of the phrase APFS format documentation is just that - a phrase they've used rather than referencing an official title.\nThe Apple File System Reference is almost certainly what they're referring to. This reference was publicly released on 17 September 2018, and Alsoft made that statement on 4 October 2018.\nPrior to the Apple File System Reference, there was no consolidated documentation from Apple regarding APFS - at least not to this level of detail. In fact, the most comprehensive documentation until this was released was actually the result of private academic work in the computer forensics field.\nAs for Apple itself, we've had the following documentation:\n\n*\n\n*Apple File System Guide - retired in June 2018\n\n*About Apple File System - first published in June 2018, but updated in October 2018 to replace references to HFS+ with HFS Plus instead\n\n*File System Programming Guide - last updated in April 2018\n\nHowever, the Apple File System Reference was last updated in February 2019 June 2020.\n\nA: Apple has not yet published full APFS documentation. Only information about reading APFS disks has been released. Missing documentation is about how to write to APFS disks. Until then, DiskWarrior 6 to rebuild APFS disk directory cannot be released.\nCheck out what Micromat says about it in relation to TechTool Pro:\n\nAPFS - AGAIN no support\nProviding full support for APFS is entirely dependent on Apple\n  releasing the required documentation for developers. So far, only the\n  documentation explaining the APIs for reading APFS volumes has been\n  released. It is about 140 pages long. We need similar documentation\n  for writing to APFS volumes.\n\nsource: https://www.micromat.com/component/kunena/techtool-pro-11/5225-apfs-again-no-support\nWhy? When will it happen? Surprisingly, APFS is still a work in progress. We could say that it is still in beta phase. Hopefully, Apple will announce Time Machine 2 supporting APFS on June 2020 (WWDC). Then, macOS 10.16 with it will be released by end of September 2020. And then Apple will hopefully release really and truly full (sort of) APFS documentation. Then DiskWarrior 6 could be expected in about three to six months testing period. Hopefully.\n", "Q: Limit mac CPU frequency without disabling Turbo Boost? Intel mobile CPUs now have a really low base frequency and a high Turbo Boost freq, e.g. i5 2.4~4.1 GHz.\nTurbo at 3.8+ makes it go all the way up to 100°C. Using 'Turbo Boost Switcher' to disable TB makes the freq too low at 2.4.\nIs there any way to limit CPU freq at some intermediate value like 3.2?\n\nA: As I understand the intel feature it's on or off.  There is no in between setting.\nAlso running at above the base frequency will cause the CPU temp to creep up slowly.\n", "Q: Is it true that iOS devices use a hard coded time.apple.com dns for an ntp server? I read that the only way to point an IOS device at your own NTP server is to change your dns sever’s record for time.apple.com to point at your NTP server so that when the iOS device requests the time from the hard-coded time.apple.com it returns that NTP server’s is instead of the one apple returns.\nIs that true for all versions of iOS and does it work on iPod Touches?  Additionally, does it request on port 123 like most NTP clients?\n\nA: Yes it's true and yes it is very hard coded.  Yes it uses standard port 123 UDP.\nJamf is the Apple Business Manager for iOS devices and there is no setting in there either.  See https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/11772/ntp-server-for-ipads\nLike the article says create an A record for time.apple.com and set the IP to your NTP server and that's it.\n", "Q: If we install \"modified games\" on our iPhone or iPad, what risks are we exposing ourselves to? For example, through TweakBox, AppValley, or even some website, we can install some \"mod\" or \"modified games\" (such as a Pacman that never dies, or a game that requires your location but the app can emulate the GPS location).\nWe have to go to Settings and \"trust\" the app. If we trust the app, to what extend of risks are we exposed to?  I don't believe the app can go to the Mail or Gmail app and look at our emails, for example. The only thing I can think of is that it fakes a log in screen to your iTunes account and lead you to type in the user name and password (Trojan horse), so I will always cancel such log in popup and go to iTunes and log in there myself.\n\nA: Strongly recommend not to install such apps via any such (untrusted) medium\nThere's a likelihood that you may be exposing yourself to innumerable risks. These apps are distributed by gaming the Apple Developer Enterprise license.\nThey are distributed without going through the standard Apple's App Store Review Process. So it's likely that may be breaking one or more review guidelines and posing risk to the security of device and data.\nApple continuously discovers and suspend enterprise licenses where they are gamed to distribute apps to general public without going through the App Store Review process. Enterprise license is created solely for the purpose of distributing apps within an enterprise, and not to general public.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's Enterprise Developer Program Also Being Used to Distribute Hacked Apps\n\n\nThe only I can think of is that it fakes a log in screen to your iTunes account and lead you to type in the user name and password (Trojan horse), so I will always cancel such log in popup and go to iTunes and log in there myself.\n\nIf you are concerned about this particular risk, i.e. an app presenting a fake iTunes login popup and stealing password, there's an easy way to trust it's authenticity.\nJust press the Home button (or on devices without Home button, navigate back to Home screen). If the popup is presented by the app (fake), it will be sent to the background along with the app. If the popup is presented by iOS (genuine), pressing Home button won't let you dismiss it. You will be able to dismiss it either by entering password or the pressing the cancel button.\n", "Q: Configure Google Calendar notification sound on iOS On iPhone we can configure notification sounds for iCloud Calendar and the iPhone Reminders app, but I cannot find any way to configure a sound for Google Calendar app on iPhone.

Recently the charity built an iOS app so people can download the course videos and other material to their devices. It also allows users to buy the courses by going to the charity website.\nThe app was rejected by Apple, as the people building it didn't know that all In-App purchases must go through Apple (yes, they are very green developers, and I wonder if it's the first app they built).\nI'm wondering how the app could be changed, so the purchases don't break App Store's Terms & Conditions, and at the same time don't need to be done through Apple, even if they need to be done outside the app (on a desktop computer). The App Store Terms & Conditions that the app supposedly broke are:\n\n3.1.3(a) “Reader” Apps: Apps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as classroom management apps), provided that you agree not to directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods are not designed to discourage use of in-app purchase.\n3.1.3(b) Multiplatform Services: Apps that operate across multiple platforms may allow users to access content, subscriptions, or features they have acquired elsewhere, including consumable items in multi-platform games, provided those items are also available as in-app purchases within the app. You must not directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase, and your general communications about other purchasing methods must not discourage use of in-app purchase.\n\nSo I'm wondering which of the following might be OK, or break the Terms & Conditions; please let me know if there are other options!\n\n\n*\n\n*Only allow access to the content that has already been purchased, without any mention that more courses are available.\n\n*Show other courses, but without a price and some text saying \"log in to the website to know more\".\n\n*Show courses with a price and text saying \"log in to the website to know more\".\n\n\nFor what I know, having a link to an external website to do the purchase is against the Terms & Conditions, so that's out of the question.\n\nA: Out of the three, going with the first option would be your best bet.\n\nOnly allow access to the content that has already been purchased, without any mention that more courses are available.\n\nAs mentioned in the first point 3.1.3(a), you can't directly or indirectly target users to an alternate mechanism to purchase content.\nYou can let the users view other available courses, and let them get info/sample of them, but can't hint about purchasing from an alternate medium within the app (if need to, you'll have to go via Apple by leveraging In-App purchases or subscriptions).\nA good way to approach it would be to think of the iOS app as a client app for media consumption and not for content promotion. Your marketing efforts should be directed to the website with the iOS app simply acting as a consumption means.\nMention the iOS app on the website, with the App Store link (once approved). Apple provides marketing resource on its website where you can obtain official App Store badges and use them to link to your iOS app on the App Store.\n", "Q: How can I find all the modifications and installations done by a spam dmg? I downloaded a 1.5 MB dmg file from a inauthentic site and despite suspicion, opened it and opened the app inside it. Assume that the game I wanted was game, so it was named game.dmg. It mounted installer and showed the icon of installer.app. It didn't install the expected software ofc, but displayed the privacy policy of InstallCore and then two software recommendations which I denied. After which, it showed a link which let me download real software. Back to Finder, it showed completed Installation.\nI have the dmg and I can open it again but I need to know where to look to find all the installations, files it wrote etc. I checked in System Report-> installations sorted by date. Only Adobe Flash Player was something I don't remember installing on that day. It was pre-installed. I have removed it for now. \nMalwareBytes scan didn't show anything. \nFeel free to ask for package contents, screenshots, system logs, activity monitor details etc. MacOS Mojave on MacBook Air. \n\nA: In general it is not possible to figure out after the fact what was done - unless you have backups.\nIf you have a recent backup from just before the installation, you can do a comparison with your current system to locate the differences. This is the “safest” method (I.e. least likely to miss something).\nIt is also possible to analyze the installer file itself - but modern malware tend to receive instructions from a server on what to do on the target system. Such instructions might have changed since you installed.\n\nA: I recommend Pacifist from Charlessoft. This will open any .pkg file and show you the files, and where they will be installed to. You can also inspect pre- and post- install shell scripts, if present, and see what they do.\n", "Q: Why isn't a binary file shown as 0s and 1s?

(Of course most of these are read-only, but that's not about the editor and more the permissions/SIP).\nvi -b /bin/ps\n\nThen to convert the buffer to bits of 1 and 0\n:%!xxd -b\n\nThen you can see all the Mach-0 executable binary goodness, right from within the editor. If you drop the b, you get the more typical hexidecimal representation that's more space efficient encoding and you don't see the values mapped as ASCII derived characters where so many values end up as ^@^@^@ when you start from a plain text centric default.\n\nA: When dealing with computers, there are two interpretations of the word binary.\n\n\n*\n\n*In terms of number system, it refers to a base 2 number system which uses two symbols, 0 and 1.\n\n*When speaking of a file, it refers to a file containing non-textual data (executables, libraries, data files etc.).\nA binary file that can be run as a process is called an executable binary.\nA file being binary file doesn't simply mean that it will be displayed simply in terms of 0's and 1's. There are layers of abstractions at work as to how files are handled by a computer.\nShowing a binary file in terms of 0 and 1 would make the output unnecessarily lengthy, and is not the most optimal approach. A binary file is shown in a text editor according to the default encoding set for that editor.\nAlso, if an editor is configured to show binary output, it will also display every file, even plain text ones, in terms of 0's and 1's. Everything ultimately boils down to binary when stored in a computer.\nTo view a file in the most basic form of 0's and 1's, you'll need to use a special editor mode which is capable of displaying the binary data of a file. One such way is using the built-in xxd command in macOS.

A single byte, as you may know, can store any of 256 different values; from eight zeroes to eight ones.\nWhen you open the binary file in a text editor, it is showing you these byte-sized chunks instead of each individual bit. The symbols it picks are determined by your editor's default encoding. Often, one character in your editor corresponds to one byte in the actual file, though there are special cases.\nIf you see a string of readable text, such as __stub_helper, it means that particular text is stored as-is within the binary file.\nThe special cases I mentioned before are so-called control characters that are displayed with an escape code. Escape codes, as seen here, begin with ^ and are followed by a single additional character. This pair, such as ^@ are taken together to represent a single byte. In fact, the symbol ^@ is the value zero, meaning the bits at that location would be eight zeroes.\nThe reason that your text editor displays the binary file in this manner is that it simply displays all files in this manner. If you were to use a hex editor, it would display any and all files in hexadecimal instead. In fact, there's no fundamental difference between the contents of a binary file and the contents of a text file -- it's the metadata and file headers that let your computer know which is which.\n\nA: The simplest answer to your question is: For efficiency. As others have said in their answers, files are displayed using a more compact notation than raw binary code, because raw binary code is unfathomably inefficient as a means of communicating data.\nTake the ps program you displayed using vi. I'm not sure about the MacOS version of the command, but on my Fedora 30 system /bin/ps is a dynamically-linked executable (meaning, some of its code is loaded from other files elsewhere on the disk) which nevertheless has a file size of around 158k, or to be precise a file size of 157224 bytes.\nSince each byte of memory contains 8 bits, you would need a string of eight 1 or 0 digits to display each individual byte of the /bin/ps file. Which means that, if you were to display the entire contents of the file as a string of just 1 or 0, that string would be 1257792 (that's one and a quarter million) digits long. \nAnd that's a relatively small file! Think about the contents of a Blu-Ray disc, which can easily come in at many dozens of gigabytes. An 80 Gigabyte movie would have a pure-binary representation requiring 640 billion 1 / 0 digits.\n", "Q: Creating a Windows partition on an external drive I am trying to basically add a Windows 10 bootable system to an external hard drive because I haven't the space on my internal to do it. I have a mid-2013 MB Pro running Sierra.  \nSo I tried the steps here: \nhttps://9to5mac.com/2017/08/31/how-windows-10-mac-boot-camp-external-drive-video/\nProblem was, the screens didn't match -- I didn't get a \"Windows Easy install\" prompt, and I suspect it's because I am using VMware 11 and that guide is a couple of years old. \nBut I need some real help. WHen I last tried this I got the windows screen (the virtual machine appeared to be working) and then it said it couldn't find the operating system. I wasn't sure what to do, \nI have seen similar questions here but I am VERY STUPID. \nProblem is, I can't seem to find a step-by-step that matches what I see on my screens. \nFor example VMware asks if I want to use UEFI (WTF is that?) or legacy BIOS. I chose Legacy after some googling which said my mac won't support the latter. \nSo, here's what I need: if anyone has a link to a step by step tutorial that covers VMware 11 that would help. \nI also would like to get a better idea of where certain files should be. For example, I have a little USB stick that I THINK is supposed to be where I download the Windows installer and support software, but I am not entirely sure. I downloaded the support software using BootCamp and moved it onto my desktop before having bootcamp turn it into what I think is the installer. But I really haven't the foggiest notion of whether I am doing things right. \nSOmebody help please. This is becoming entirely confusing for me. I even messaged the author of the original tutorial. \n\nA: This is based on my own experience of installing Windows 10 on an external drive:\nStep 1: Download VMWare Fusion and use the 30-day trial. You do not need to do this if you already have a computer with Windows 10\nStep 2: Search \"windows 10 iso image\" and click the first link from Microsoft. Download it.\nStep 3: Open the VMWare application and upload the Windows 10 iso image onto it, and run Windows. You do not need to do this if you already have a computer with Windows 10\nStep 4: Go on your virtual Windows and download WinToUSB from this: https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/.\nStep 5: Open the WinToUSB tool and upload the same Windows 10 .iso image onto it, and choose which version to install. Connect your external drive to your Mac, make sure it connects to VMWare, and select it once it shows up on WinToUSB.\nStep 6: Wait until the tool installs Windows 10 onto the external drive. While this is running, go to the Bootcamp app and ONLY download the Windows Support Software.\nStep 7: Once the WinToUSB tool finishes installing, you can close out of VMWare by shutting down from the virtual Windows. The connected external drive should show up on your mac again, and drag the Windows Support Software folder into the drive.\nYou should now have an external drive with Windows 10 on it, and the Windows Support Software on it as well. You can boot from it by restarting and holding option and choosing the external drive. Use the Windows Support Software to install the correct Apple Drivers in the external drive when inside the Windows 10 boot.\nThis was the method that worked for me on an Early 2014 MacBook Air on High Sierra and should work on yours. Comment if you have any problems.\n", "Q: Can't access localhost server after pf redirect After adding some pf rules to redirect certain egress traffic to a localhost server, I can't access that localhost server directly.

With whom? For the last few days I've been getting a message on my lock screen\n\nUnlocking with Apple Watch is not available while your screen is being shared\n\n\nA tad worrisome but I sort of disregarded and chalked it up to maybe a go2meeting screenshare not properly telling the os it's done or my some bug related to my secondary monitor being attached.\nBut I got it this morning after a full restart and without my secondary monitor attached. Now I'm kinda worried! Is my screen being shared with someone?! How would I even know?!\nnote that screen sharing is off:\n\n\nA: There may be a less drastic explanation for this. I had the exact same issue and found that this happens after using slack for calls where I share my screen. So just restart slack after your call has ended. Haven't tested it with other screen sharing software yet.\nSome ones to watch are the obvious, Zoom, BlueJeans, Microsoft Teams, Google, as well as all manner of remote support apps that don't necessarily use Apple's Screen Sharing controls in system preferences.\n\nA: I'm seeing this quite prominently with the latest update to Google Chrome Remote Desktop. Sure would be great if they fixed it, but I'm not holding my breath.\nUninstalling the app works to fix the issue of course. \n\nA: If you are connected to an external display or projector through USB, HDMI, miniDisplay/firewire, Thunderbolt or even wirelessly, DON'T WORRY! It is just an Apple bug thats been reported. You don't need to worry about that but unfortunately, you can not unlock your mac with your Apple Watch while connected.\nDisconnect all externals and retry and see if it works.\nIf not, YOU SHOULD WORRY. It could be one of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen sharing is on\ntry turning it on and off again. Then Click on Computer settings and turn off all options there.\n\n*Remote Management\ntry turning it on and off again.\n\n*Check open ports and activities of your computer and see if there is any suspicious activities and kill them.\n\n*It could be spyware. You can create another user account and logout and login there and see if the issue is persists. If so, you should probably wipe your computer and install all software (including the OS itself) if you want to completely sure about cleanness of your system and not restore it from backup after. Just copy the files you need and don't restore from your Time Machine backup.\n\n\nA: I would also double-check remote login and remote management. If you think you're being monitored check the activity monitor for anything out of the ordinary and you can also run a virus/malware scan on your system. If nothing comes up you're probably fine and it could just be some weird bug. If you're still worried about it you can change all your passwords (including your Wi-Fi access key if you're on your home network) and then restart your computer and your router. If you have access to your router you can also check to see if someone is on it that shouldn't be on it.\nAnother thing you can do is check which ports are open (nmap can do this if you're unsure how) and turn off any sharing protocols such as ARD (apple remote desktop)\nIf you do all of this I would be quite surprised if your screen was still being monitored!\n", "Q: AirPods won't switch to MacBook My AirPods (1st gen) won't switch over to my MacBook Air (early 2015 running the latest Mojave) from my iPhone 8. When I click 'connect' the indicator just spins and nothing happens. Restarting resolves this, and my AirPods are then able to connect to my MacBook. Any ideas as to the cause of this? Are my AirPods perhaps faulty?\n\nA: Apple has always these kind of bugs with their wireless (or even wired) platforms. You just need to force it to connect.\nSo you can go to sound settings of system preferences and force connect there.\n\nor if you already have the indicator in the status bar , you can option+click on that and force connect from there.\nNote that it could either fail because it may be in-use or disconnect from the other source that already connected and using it (Randomly but second option most of the times depends on what device requested new connection and what device is using it right now).\nIt always helps me and hope it helps you as well.\n", "Q: Google Voice Indicator I would like to know when an inbound call originates from the GV number (versus the iPhone's carrier number).  Is there a procedure that allows one to configure the iPhone to indicate the call is a GV call?\nUPDATE: Assume that the GV is for a business and the inbound calls are from unknown phone numbers.\n\nA: As far as your phone is concerned a Google Voice call is no different than any other call, so your only options involve Google Voice settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Make and receive calls = Prefer Wi-Fi and mobile data. This will make your phone treat the calls as VoIP calls which explicitly say the service they're using. This is how I use Google Voice and the quality is typically better than using the carrier service, which I have also used extensively in the past. Also iOS 12 improved the way VoIP calls are handled in the UI to make them work just like regular calls when your screen is locked (same phone UI as a carrier call).\n\n*If you want to use your carrier service,  you can change the incoming caller ID to show your Google voice number instead of the caller's number. This way you always know it's a Google Voice call, but you won't necessarily know who it's from. This is also why I prefer option 1.\n\n", "Q: iPhone plays call ringtone over connected bluetooth speakers while on silent more When I have my iPhone X on silent and I'm playing music through my Bluetooth speaker, if someone calls me I hear the ring over the speaker.\nHow do I stop this?\n\nA: How To Stop Ringing Through the Bluetooth Speaker when the Music is On \n\nAfter connecting your phone to the Bluetooth device, go to your phone’s Settings then Bluetooth Settings. Under the section Bluetooth Paired Devices you will see two settings for the paired devices: phone audio and media audio. Uncheck the phone audio option. This will stop your phone from ringing while connected to the Bluetooth device (speaker) but the music will stop when a call rings.\n\n", "Q: Does \"Reset Network Settings\" affect all devices? If I reset my Network Settings in iOS/iPadOS, and so lose all my WiFi networks/passwords, will my other iOS devices also lose them?\nThe reason I ask is that WiFi networks appear to be stored in the cloud (when one is entered into my iPhone, my iPad also seems to learn it). So if I erase my iPhone... will the ones in the cloud be forgotten? Or will my iPhone pull them back from the cloud?\n\nA: *\n\n*What, precisely, does \"reset network settings\" do on an iPhone?\n\nresetting network settings will remove all saved WiFi passwords in iCloud keychain, effectively deleting remembered WiFi networks from all your signed in devices. A workaround: turn off iCloud Keychain, then reset network settings, then turn iCloud Keychain back on. Your saved WiFi networks will then sync back, unharmed.\n\nThis is the behavior in devices running iOS 9 and later.\n", "Q: Tried to use bash arrays but for some reason this fails?

Cisco AnyConnect VPN opens whenever I log in and its screen covers everything for a few minutes and can't be minimized. It's really annoying and I'd like to know if there's something, maybe in its config.plist, that will prevent it from opening on startup. Does anyone know?\nI have to use Cisco AnyConnect for work, so I can't delete it.\n\nA: Yes, I'm pretty sure you can stop apps from opening on startup even though it ignores Login Items.

I water damaged my Macbook Air 2017 and it will no longer turn on. I was thinking of selling the MBA for some money but wanted to make sure that my security is not compromised. \nIf I remove the SSD from the motherboard (and sell it without the SSD), am I safe to assume that none of my personal data is still on the laptop?\n\nA: Yes, you can assume that none of your data is still on the MacBook Air. All personal data stored on the laptop itself is stored on the SSD, so removing this effectively removes the data from the laptop.\nIt is also possible that the SSD is still fully functioning, so if you made the mistake of not backing up your data, you may be able to still access it from the SSD, via adaptors, external enclosures or another MBA of the same generation.\nYou may also want to refer to Apple's advice on what to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac.\n", "Q: Pointless USB on my Apple Monitor?

Let’s say I always know my row will be 14.\nI only know the column by another value above it.\nFor example, $Q$7 = A\nI want to be able to take that value A and add it so that my formula is now $A$14.\nI need a formula that finds the value of $Q$7 and places it as $A$14.\nThen if I applied that to let’s say $D$5 where $D$5 = R\nthe same formula would now equal $R$14.\nDoes that make sense?\nI know to use = $A$14 in the cell but I want it to depend on the column.\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: I would approach this a little differently to (hopefully) simplify things a little!\nLet's assume you will use Rows 4, 7, 10, etc to enter the text of your words/sentences (which is the approach in your screenshot).\nLet's also assume that you're only going to use Columns C to W to enter your text into (although there's no reason why it can't be more columns, but this is just what I gather from your screenshot).\nFor this answer, let's assume your Alphabet is in Row 50 and your Substituted letters are in Row 51. \nIn summary, this means:\n\n\n*\n\n*the formula you need will have to be entered in every cell from C5 to W5, C8 to W8, C11 to W11, and so on\n\n*your alphabet will be in Row 50\n\n*your substituted letters will be in Row 51.\n\n\nSo, let's build this using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Row 50 add the letters of the alphabet from A50 to Z50\n\n*In Row 51 add your substituted letters\n\n*Enter the following formula in cell of C5:\n\n\n=IFERROR(LOOKUP(C4, $A$50:$Z$50,$A$51:$Z$51),\"\")\n(The reason we're using IFERROR in the formula is so Numbers will ignore any spaces in your sentences, rather than displaying an ugly error icon.)\n\n\n*Copy and paste the formula from cell C5 to your other cells (i.e. cells D5:W5, C8:W8, C11:W11, and so on)\n\n*Now start entering your text to be ciphered into cells C4:W4, C7:W7, C10:W10 and so on\n\n*As you enter the text, the ciphered result should appear in the cell below. If it's a space, the cell below will remain blank\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be careful to only include the letter and nothing else in each cell of your Alphabet row. Having a space or anything else will cause problems. For example, if you entered your E with a space after it, then Numbers will never find the E because it's looking for an 'E' and not a 'E ', if you get what I mean.\n\n*If you have the need to have no substitute value for some letters of the alphabet, then the result will be a 0 (i.e. a zero is displayed) instead of a blank cell. If this applies to you, you could create a conditional highlight to hide the result.\n\n*Personally, I would actually put your alphabet and substituted values in another worksheet, but this may not be necessary for your purposes. \n\n", "Q: Enabling OS X 10.9 support on 10.8 (Mountain Lion)? My MacBook Pro is running OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and I have been literally advised by an authorised vendor not to install 10.9 due to its bugs.\n(I would appreciate not to be given the advise to upgrade to 10.9 or higher, that would be a major disruption for my system running bug-free for many years.

Or is this impossible for Time Machine and I should use an alternative program such as rsync?\n\nA: Time Machine Keeps Weekly Backups.\nIf you want to keep backups that are more regular than weekly, but less regularly than hourly then it's probably best to use a different solution. Time Machine doesn't have these settings (apparently not even in hidden settings).\nTime machine keeps weekly backups as space permits. It also stores daily backups for the past month, and hourly backups for the past 24 hours.\nPros and Cons (case examples)\nIn the case that you create a file one day and then delete it about two days later, more than a month passes before you want to recover the file, and the weekly backup that is kept for that time period is not between the time the file was created and the time it was deleted, then a daily backup will keep the file and a weekly backup will not. This is the specific scenario where another backup solution will be desirable. However if you create a file one hour, delete it two hours later, and less than a day has passed, then Time Machine would have the file backed up, but a daily backup is unlikely to have it backed up.\nI suspect that you'll find doing hourly backups with rsync will be more intensive for your computer than Time Machine's hourly backups.\n\nA: I ended up writing a script that cancels Time Machine's operation when it goes into the \"cleaning up\" phase. The content is as follows:\n#!/usr/local/bin/fish\nwhile test 0=0\nif tmutil status | grep -q \"BackupPhase = ThinningPostBackup\"\n          tmutil status\n    tmutil stopbackup\nelse\n    sleep 10\nend\nend\n\nNote that this script will also prevent Time Machine from cleaning incomplete backups. To clean those, first run fsck_hfs -dfy twice, the second time rebuilding the b-trees (-Race). Then move the <***.inProgress> folder to trash using /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/helpers/bypass mv <***.inProgress folder> </volumes/drive name/.Trashes/UID/. Then, empty the trash using Finder, because only Finder can deal with deleting hard-linked directories. (Backup the trash on your startup and other connected disk first if you don't want to delete those). Then, run fsck_hfs dfy again, and you're done.\nNote: this procedure (mainly the fsck_hfs ones) only applies to TM sparsebundles on network drive. Network errors can cause small filesystem errors which can build up eventually. So regular fsck is important to prevent big filesystem errors, especially when you're doing something which involves a lot of filesystem modification (like deleting a ton of directory hard-links here).\nAlternatively, you can also use Carbon Copy Cloner, and if you set a long time for safety net APFS snapshots, a long and more detailed period of history will be preserved.\n\nA: Many thanks @Joy Jin. I have improved the solution by decreasing the interval from 10 seconds to 1 second to prevent cleaning backups better:\n#!/usr/local/bin/fish\nwhile test 0=0\nif tmutil status | grep -q \"BackupPhase = ThinningPostBackup\"\n    tmutil status\n    tmutil stopbackup\n    echo '!'\n    say \"Prevented cleaning Time Machine backups\"\nelse\n    echo -ne '.'\n    sleep 1\nend\nend\n\nIt is important to create a daemon (e.g. in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons), to be run permanently.\n", "Q: Outlook for Mac 2011 - how to delete buggy email in outbox that crashes Outlook I have an email in my Outbox that continually crashes Outlook for Mac 2011 with a \"rebuild database\" error message. Rebuilding the database took days and never completed. If I start Outlook in safe mode (holding the shift key when loading), I can get into Outlook but the moment I hit Send/Receive or switch to the Outbox folder (where the culprit email is sitting), I immediately get the \"rebuild database\" error message and can either Rebuild or Cancel, the latter exits Outlook.\nIs there a way to empty the Outbox folder through the file system without click on the folder in Outlook?

It loaded an old song automatically, and the instrument was a synth. I switched it to a Grand Piano and began to play a 3 note chord. As I played the chord a couple of times, the instrument switch back to the synth.\nI tried a few more times and the same thing happened. I finally tracked it down to it performing an undo function, and I was able to select redo to change the instrument back to a Grand Piano. Every time I play a 3 note chord, it does this undo making it very hard to play what I am trying to play. It happens for any chord I play and on both sides of the screen.\nI am running the beta of iPadOS as well, if that matters!\nIs this normal? I've not really used GarageBand on my iPad much...\n\nA: In iPadOS 13 undo and redo are three finger gestures. Undo is supposed to be a three finger swipe to the left and redo a three finger swipe to the right. The movement to or from a three finger chord certainly may be recognized as a quick swipe. Try disabling gestures in Settings. Because this is in beta the location of settings like this may change between releases. I'd look in Settings->General and disable gestures to start.\n\nA: It is in fact the undo behavior which cannot yet be disabled in iPadOS.  However this is unique to GarageBand as other sequencers like (Cubasis) don’t have the same issue \n", "Q: Removing User from Single User Mode Fails - MacOS 10.14 So I’m trying to delete a specific user account while avoiding the traditional SysPrefs method.

I have .img file now.\nWill trying to do data recovery from a clone of a drive affect the chances of recovery VS doing recovery on the drive itself? Do all data recovery software that can attempt to recover data on the original drive also be able to attempt to recover data from .img clone that I have?\n\nA: No, there's no difference when you have a byte-for-byte identical clone as you have. And yes, data recovery software should work the same for an original drive as for an image-based clone.\nIn other cases than yours there could be a slight difference - namely when we're dealing with defective hardware. If you have a broken hard drive for example it might be that if you do a naive clone multiple times, you'll end up with different images. That is not good.\nIn your case, I advised you to use \"dd\" to create a clone. That works perfectly well with functioning hardware.\nIf you had broken hardware, I would have advised instead to use \"ddrescue\". That utility has support for things like reading the same block multiple times in order to get as much correct data as possible from a malfunctioning drive. Also it can do stuff like leave holes in the clone image that corresponds to the non-working parts of the original drive.\nNote that because of TRIM a functioning SSD drive could limit your possibilities of recovering data from the clone. However if you use data recovery software you run yourself on your Mac, then the clone and the original will let you recover exactly the same data.\nThe only difference is if you access the flash ICs on the SSD drive directly to try to recover data that has been TRIM’ed away. However that is not possible from macOS (or Windows or similar), rather you would typically need specialized hardware and software not commonly available. If you are considering sending in your data to a professional recovery service that has these capabilities, you’ll definitely want to stop using the original drive and send that in - and the continue working on your clone drive instead. NOTE: I know of no such recovery service in existence anywhere for your hardware - I think your only bet is Apple at the moment.\n\nA: In your specific case\nWith the command you used, if dd encountered errors it just stops. So if no errors were reported when you used it, then you are good to go: there are no meaningful differences in your case as described.\nThe main difference is it will increase your chances of success when working with a damaged drive: Making an image/clone of a damaged drive and then working from the image (while the original is set aside someplace safe) will increase the chances of recovery because, once a drive becomes damaged, further use of the drive will often aggravate the issues. For example, using a damaged drive can corrupt more data, or do more damage and make the drive stop working altogether.\nGeneral Answer\nThe command you linked dd if=/dev/rdisk1s1 of=/Volumes/ExternalDrive/clone.img bs=1m doesn't have the most robust options for dd to create an image from a damaged drive.\nAdding conv=noerror,sync will make dd continue, even if errors are found, and write null bites in place of unreadable blocks.\ndd bs=4k if=/dev/rdisk1s1 of=/Volumes/ExternalDrive/clone.img conv=noerror,sync\nAlternately use a utility like ddrescue which has an option to specify the number of times to retry reading a block that could not be read.\n", "Q: Installing Older Version of MacOS/OSX alongside current So with the end of 32-bit App support, I was thinking \nmaybe if I run across an app that I really need to run than will no long run post 10.15, that it might be a good idea to have an older version on a small partition for this purpose. I was personally due to my likening of that version of OSX thinking about trying to install 10.11 on a separate partition on my Mac. However I keep hearing that it’s not possible to install an older version of MacOS/OSX (in dual boot) while a newer one is installed, is this the case?\nMy Mac will happily run 10.11 as it did back when it was current so that’s not the issue. It’s rather can I just get an installer ready and plop it on a blank partition and then just select it in the bootmanger with 10.15 and Windows, or will it not install because of having 10.15 installed currently?\n\nA: Yes, you can certainly install two versions alongside.\nThe answer from benwiggy is incorrect in assuming that you cannot have APFS and HFS+ coexisting on the same physical drive. It is indeed possible, and very easily achievable using Disk Utility to create two partitions on the drive. One for the APFS container (which holds your APFS file systems), and one for the HFS+ file system.\nInstead of running 10.11, I would recommended having 10.14 and 10.15 coexisting. The reason being that support for 10.11 ended a year ago - this means that if you want to connect it to a network, you'll probably end up with security related issues.\n", "Q: Can I limit my dock to only show up on the main display?

Everything is going well, but I've hit a tiny snag that I can't work out.\nI have one iMac, running Mojave, that I have previously logged into with my AD account with no issues. It is possible that I left the screen locked and myself logged in, and then subsequently have changed my account password. Now I am unable to log back into the iMac - just get the shakey password. The machine has been rebooted a number of times since. \nI've tried removing the user profile for my account from the Users folder - no difference.\nI've tried unbinding the machine from the AD and rejoining, but no dice. I can log in with other AD accounts, so it's clearly not an issue with the binding.\nI can log into the machine over SSH with my domain account creds, and authenticate administrator actions if logged in as a non-admin user with them too, so clearly the machine knows my creds are good and that I'm an administrator.\nIt's like there's something cached that needs cleared out, but I'm lost as to what.\nI'd greatly appreciate any advice - I don't want to have to deal with Users having the same issue in the future without a way forward.\n\nA: Interestingly, I found a solution for my issue after some testing. In the hope that it helps someone else, this is what I found.\nMy initial, and many subsequent logins on the device were just Username & Password, and this just stopped working. When I tried domain\\username and password it sailed through, asked me to update my keychain, and I was logged in.\nThat's quite an unusual change of behaviour, as if the device had forgotten that my account was a network account, and was trying to authenticate it locally.

I have about 30 iPod touch devices that connect to a charger with multiple ports on it.\nThere are 4x 5V/2.4A ports and 4x 5V/1A ports on the device that charges them.\nIt seems as though the the 5V/1A devices never get charged but I read that the for the Apple cube chargers that come with the devices they are actually the correct ones.\nThese devices are used until their power is drained and then returned to the charger as evidenced by how many of them I pick up on the charger read please enter pin number after restart.\nThe 5V/2.4A charger seems to charge them faster, but the 5V/1A appears to be the correctly rated ones.\nThe voltage (a.k.a. electrical pressure) going into the devices is the same on both port types, but the amperage (a.k.a. the amount of electricity in the circuit) is much greater on the 5V/2.4A ports;\nAs I understand electricity, it's a bit like plumbing where too much water will cause a pipe to burst, and in electrical systems, too much electricity (amps) will cause a wire to catch on fire, they are sort of analogous. \nI also know that if a battery is fully charged, you really shouldn't leave a device plugged in, it's bad for the life span of the battery.\nSo my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it dangerous to be using a charger that uses more than the recommend amperage, or can you get away with a little bit more?\n\n*How can I ensure that these devices are taken off the charger when they are full?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Excess amperage cannot \"force\" its way into a device (that's the danger of excess voltage).  A device will only receive what it draws.\n\n*That is an interesting question with a more nuanced answer:\n\n\n'Smart' USB chargers, like those found on Amazon, determine the amperage they provide based on the draw trends of the plugged-in device; as long as the device is drawing, they will provide.  However, some can detect and identify the sharp drop-off of draw that accompanies the end of the charging cycle and cut power from the port.\nYou can find more info about this kind of thing from this answer:  https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/121366/how-do-usb-charging-and-smart-charging-ports-e-g-ankers-poweriq-work\n\nA: Very simply put...\n\n\n*\n\n*No. Amperage is 'pulled' by the device being charged, not 'pushed' from the charger. So, as long as the voltage is correct, the amperage can be anything.\n\n*They are designed to handle being left on charge. Their inbuilt circuitry stops pulling charge once they're full.\nPotentially, if the devices on the 1A outlets are charging noticeably slower than those on the 2A, then the full power isn't actually being delivered.\nMeasuring actual voltage/amperage on a working outlet is just short of a nightmare at consumer level, so forget it ;)\n", "Q: How can I limit iTerm2 text selection to a single tmux pane? I have a late 2013 MacBook Pro running iTerm2. I don't have tmux installed on it, but I use tmux on the remote Linux host I frequently connect to via ssh. When tmux is displaying a vertical split and I use the trackpad to select text, the selection is automatically limited to just one pane. That's exactly how I want it.\nI have recently begun using a 2018 MacBook Pro. Using the same iTerm2 version (3.2.9), and the same remote tmux session, text selection spans the entire window width instead of staying in a single pane.\nWhat setting controls that behavior?\nI'm aware I can hold Command+Option to select a block of text, but that's not what I'm after. I'm looking to select, for example, a sentence that starts mid-paragraph and spans multiple lines. Block selection doesn't allow that.\n\nA: I had the same question and it was hard to google answer.\nChoosing Edit > Selection Respects Soft Boundaries works fine.\n\nA: tmux panes are simply logical windows emulated within a single text field.  This means that the OSX system-level text handling does not recognize the tmux panes as separate fields.  To get the behavior you desire you'll need to override or simply not use the default OS behavior.\nInstead, you'll need to learn to use tmux's own internal selection/copy functionality (Copy Mode).  This respects pane boundaries and enables selection/move/copy using non-system-hotkey presses.\nSee this cheat sheet for info on how to use it:  https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/\nEDIT:\nAh, then you need to enable mouse mode.

Typically this covers things like interpreting and responding to various sensors, battery charging, sleep/wake/hibernation, the power button and restarts/shutdowns, LED indicators, and so on.\nTo reset the SMC on your model MBP follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Press ShiftControlOption on the left side of the built-in keyboard, and press the power button at the same time\n\n*Keep holding these down for at least 10 seconds before letting go\n\n*Power up the MBP again\n\n\nOnce you've done this keep an eye on your battery status to see if you notice any changes.\nAs an aside, I note your battery has a cycle count of 837. To put this into perspective, your MacBook Pro battery has a life expectancy at or around 1000 cycles.  It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; it's just an estimation of how long it can last.   You can refer to Determine battery cycle count for Mac notebooks on Apple's website for more info.\nAs your battery condition is listed as Normal I wouldn't be too concerned about the cycle count yet, but you may need to think about a battery replacement in the not-too-distant future.\nYou may also like to take a look at How to reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac.

However, I'm using Numbers, not Excel. Is there a way to replicate those results using Numbers? The Format menu doesn't seem to have too many parameters to adjust regarding this.\n\nThe current workaround I have is to set the graph to \"2D Area\" (1), selecting the line itself in the graph, setting No Fill, and then setting the Stroke parameter. This achieves the intended effect (2), but doesn't scale well with multiple (overlapping) datasets.\n\n\n\nAnd here's the data when enabling 2D Line\n\n\nA: You should plot the data using the 2d Scatter plot.

Given the added screenshot with your error message, the JavaScript being executed cannot find ‘fetch’ which is likely a reference to the Fetch API, a crucial API for obtaining resources from elsewhere. The Fetch API is first supported in Safari 10.1.\nIf the web developer hasn’t included a polyfill for Safari 9, it may be possible to inject the polyfill yourself for individual web technology features, but this situation will only get worse. I understand the potential need to run older software, but such use should be limited to a virtual machine, ensuring the host OS is secure as well as running a secure web browser capable of understanding the technologies present on your favourite sites.\n1 ES2015 (or ECMAScript 2015) is a scripting-language specification created to standardise JavaScript for use by multiple browsers, applications, and devices.

I am aware that acrobat allows you to do this. I am looking for \na  solution in Preview (Version 8.1 (877.7))\nThis is a variation of this post, or that post which apply respectively to text font size or comments in MS Word.\nHere I want to change the font in \nthe comments of Preview.\nEven if I copy a bigger text font inside it, it is made smaller once the note is closed.

I have the following keys in my Preview plist:\n\"PVAnnotationFontSize_12\" = 10;\n\"PVAnnotationFontSize_17\" = 10;\n\"PVAnnotationFontSize_5\" = \"11.99199\";\n\"PVAnnotationFontSize_6\" = 10;\n\nHowever, modifying those does not change the text size for either Annotations or Notes. Annotations seem to keep the last settings used. Notes don't seem to be editable in the UI.\nAlso, note that you don't need to use grep to read a specific plist key. E.g. defaults read com.apple.Preview PVAnnotationFontSize_5\nEDIT: Having probed into the plist data and the text strings within the Preview app itself, I'm not convinced that there is an editable key for the font size or style in Preview's Notes.\n\nA: I figured it out. Download the tinker tool, then go to fonts and increase the size of the help tag and you're golden. The size of the notes in the preview will increase to 24. Relaunch preview to see the change. You can even delete the tinker tool after the setting is changed. The change in font size will remain. :) –\n\nA: How can I change default font Notes - Sierra, High Sierra\nIs this relevant? I think the same could be done for Preview but I don't know how to figure out the hexadecimal code for the font and font size I want. \nI am struggling with the same problem and I really want a solution.  \n", "Q: Can I use AppleScript to delete files on NAS listed in a file? I am cleaning up my iTunes folders. I realized that there are more than 3k of files which are actually not in iTunes. I identified them and I have all of them inside a text file called \"untitled.txt\" in the format below.\n/Volumes/Multimedia/Music/ITunes Media/Kiko/Come On Up/Come On Up.mp3\n/Volumes/Multimedia/Music/ITunes Media/Kiko/Traxxxx/Traxxxx.mp3\n\nThe files are sitting on my NAS so my question would be what would the script look like and will it read the NAS file format (I think it is ext4).\n\nA: As an alternative to using AppleScript, it is so much easier just to do it in Terminal using bash, e.g.:\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do echo rm \"$line\"; done < /path/to/untitled.txt\n\nRun it as is with the echo command to have a look1  at its output, and if it look okay, then run the command again without echo in it.\nNote that when run without the echo command, the path file names will be quoted, so while with echo command will show as e.g.:\nrm /Volumes/Multimedia/Music/ITunes Media/Kiko/Come On Up/Come On Up.mp3\n\nHowever, without the echo command, the rm command with the path file names will execute as e.g.:\nrm \"/Volumes/Multimedia/Music/ITunes Media/Kiko/Come On Up/Come On Up.mp3\"\n\nThus handling path file names that contains spaces.\n\n1Hint: Enlarge the window in Terminal so you see the full line without it wrapping on the screen as this will make it easier to see any anomalies, if any.\n\nA: However, if you do prefer to use an AppleScript solution, this following AppleScript code should do the trick.\nThis AppleScript code works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\nset filePathsTextFile to \"/path/to/untitled.txt\"\n\nset posixFiles to readFile(filePathsTextFile)\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    repeat with i in posixFiles\n        try\n            set thisItem to i as POSIX file as alias\n            delete thisItem\n        on error errMsg number errNum\n            activate\n            display alert \"Cannot Locate File To Be Deleted\" message ¬\n                errMsg & \"  Error Code. \" & errNum & linefeed & linefeed ¬\n                & \"Please Make Sure The Volume Containing File To Be Deleted Is Mounted Or File Exists\" as ¬\n                critical buttons {\"OK\"} giving up after 10\n            return\n        end try\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\non readFile(filePathsTextFile)\n    set theFile to filePathsTextFile\n    set theParagraphs to read theFile as text using delimiter linefeed\nend readFile\n\n", "Q: Can i invite someone on my LAN to view my screen using Apple Remote Desktop?

How can I find out? I have written a computer program in C++, compiled it and ran it within terminal using the command line. This program has run fine many times, but it appears that whenever its accumulated CPU time exceeds 60 minutes (which occurs after about 9 minutes as it runs at ~700% on eight threads) it is killed by the run-time system (at least that is suggested by monitoring it using top).\nThere is no error or other message, but merely the word \"Killed\" printed to the command line:\nMacBook-Pro-8:~/directory> ./program_name options\nKilled\n\nIs there a limit on the accumulated CPU time for such processes?

Though I'm still mystified why this should result in a kill signal. But this appears off topic here. I have asked on Stack Overflow.\n\nA: In general there’s no limit on accumulated CPU time for processes on macOS.\nIt seems likely that your program stopped due to issues such as bugs in the program, lack of memory, or similar. In order to find out what happened, try starting your program in the debugger and look at the backtrace.\nIn addition you should replace the signal handler in the program with one, that prints out which signal it receives. You could potentially also change the program not to kill itself when receiving the signal, but instead do something - like for example freeing up memory. It depends on the signal you’re receiving whether or not it can be ignored.\n\nA: Here I put the final solution.

It is now July 2019 and I have this Late-2009 iMac.\nmacOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6 iMac (27-inch, Late 2009) Processor: 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Memory: 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 4670 256\nI can't use it anymore because it is super-super-slow. But I am considering upgrading it.\nWill adding memory and replacing the HDD with an SSD turn this into an acceptably running machine? Or is the processor simply not up to it? 'It' being mostly email and browsing (and, eg, YouTube).\nSo what exactly are my upgrading option on this iMac?\n\nA: Whether it's 'worth it' will be up to you.\nYou can get 16GB RAM in there & you can swap the HD to an SSD. \nThe SSD will feel like day after night compared to an HD - especially as you're on an OS that is designed for SSD & almost forgets spinning rust ever played a part. \nYou will be bound to 10.13 so you might not need more RAM  unless you’re sure you will run apps where the current amount is not enough. \nSince SSD is a big speedup, more RAM will let it 'breathe' a lot better doing multiple tasks... like having more browser windows open. And you’ll likely want to use it more once it’s speedy. \nIt won't turn it into any kind of powerhouse compared to a 2015 MacBook even or any new portables, but inexpensive upgrades will make it all feel more relaxed. \nExpect 4 to 8x speedup in system start time with an SSD that’s moderately priced. \n\nA: You’re more likely to benefit from extra RAM, and that model of iMac can take up to 16GB — 4GB is very low for modern MacOS versions. I am running a late 2009 i7 27” iMac, but I have 20GB of RAM and a hybrid drive in it. \n\nA: Maxing out the RAM and replacing the HDD with an SSD will certainly bring improvements. According to EveryMac, it can run High Sierra 10.13.6. This may well be sufficient for web browsing and email. \nHowever, once the OS becomes a few years old, you will start to run into compatibility problems. Also, the Core 2 Duo is a very old CPU technology, and it may struggle on complex webpages like Facebook.\nYou need to balance whether the cost of upgrading this is worth it for the couple? of years you'll get out of it before needing to invest in a new machine. Or you might still get something for it now on eBay, which you could put towards a newer Mac.\n\nA: Hi I think you'll notice a HUGE difference if you put in an SDD and max out the memory. I did both to my machine and it was wonderful. I've also got a 2009 i-mac, 27 inch, but with 2.8 Ghz Intel Core i7. I upgraded mine with 32GB memory (a few websites said it was possible at it has worked well on my machine) and also replaced the optical drive with an SSD (the optical drive wasnt working well anymore). High-sierra was running well, but I couldn't use this operating system with dual screens so I went back to sierra. At any rate, it became super fast after these upgrades. I think your processor may not be upgradeable to 32gb but check that one out. I guess the days of this beast are numbered, in terms of OS upgrades, but it is still going relatively strong after 10 years, amazing really. Other issues I've had, which you may also have, or may encounter are the dodgy optical drive, the graphics card failing (fixed with the bake remedy) and recently the old HDD failing. Good luck.  \n\nA: A bit late to the party but you can take these glorious beasts to Big Sur!

Apparently 1.1.1.1 (and maybe some other VPN apps) are breaking CarPlay. I don't know why there is an interaction between networking and CarPlay, but in my before and after tests, it was rock solid once I got rid of the CloudFlare app. \nThe DNS app seemed like a good idea, but it was not worth all the trouble it caused. \n", "Q: Is an Archive Mailbox just a regular mailbox? Or is it special? Apple Mail 9.3 has an archiving feature. I'd like to better understand what this feature does, how it works, and why someone would want to use it. Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time finding detailed documentation about it.\n\nHere's all that I can find in the documentation:  \n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"You can store messages in an Archive mailbox so you can quickly find them later when you’re ready to take action. [...] Mail creates an archive mailbox in the Mail sidebar for each account whose messages you’re archiving, and moves the messages you selected there. The messages remain there until you delete or move them.\"\n-Apple Mail Help\n\nFind them later? Well, heck, I can find messages later in my Inbox or anywhere else I decide to store them, right? Does an Archive provide an improvement in that regard?\nOther mail apps/services also have Archive mailboxes, which makes me think that they are fairly standard now.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*\"If you want to clean up your inbox without deleting your emails, you can archive or mute them.\"\n-Gmail Help \n  \n*\"This (system) folder has no additional functionality other than a handy storage place for mail you no longer consider to be current. Mail placed in this folder is automatically marked as read. You may wish to set the folder to Auto-Purge, so that old mail is automatically deleted from this folder.\"\n-Fastmail.com Help\n\nSo, below is a description of my understanding of how Archive mailboxes work in Apple Mail. Can you verify that I'm correct? Or could you expand upon this knowledge, or correct any misunderstandings?\n\n\n*\n\n*In Apple Mail, an Archive mailbox just a regular mailbox, similar to the Inbox, Sent, and Drafts mailboxes. \n\n*When an item is moved to an Archive mailbox, the message will remain on the server where the message originated. It will not move it off the server to a local location, i.e., to On My Mac.\n\n*There's not a performance benefit or storage savings to storing items in an Archive. (Because, I presume, Archives are synced via IMAP like other mailboxes, and items therein are not compressed or anything.)\n\n*Whereas some mailboxes in Apple Mail can have \"behaviors\" associated with them, this is not true for an Archive mailbox. Example: In Preferences, I can specify whether messages in a Junk mailbox should be stored on the server and/or deleted automatically after a certain period of time. \n\n*If I want to archive messages to On My Mac or a local location, I'd have to manually create a folder and move the messages there; I couldn't do so by using the Archive command.\n\n\nA: The computer can track thousands upon thousands of messages no matter what mailbox, so you are right - this is purely a human affordance.\nSetting aside any other mail service (since this is about Apple) - the archive is there purely to be a quick parking place for a message you don’t want cluttering your inbox. Most people that have used mail for a while will decide that inbox zero is a good thing so you need a place to move messages you’re not ready to decide to reply / delete or file.\nThere’s nothing fancy about archive - it’s purgatory for messages and I wouldn’t use it unless you find it helps you out organizationally. I think the list of premises you have stated seem to line up and you’re not missing anything special or dramatic about this topic or the design of Apple mail app.\n\nA: If it's like outlook Archive is a local mailbox that removes the message from the mail server.  If that is the case make sure you have good backups of the file.  I've seen many a client that lost the archive file and almost cried over the loss of e-mail.\nThis doesn't answer the question directly but does backup some of bmike's answer.\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mail/archive-emails-mail35918/mac\n", "Q: how can I use $HOME, ~ or environment variable in plist file of LaunchDaemons I want to run a program by use plist, eg\n<key>Program</key>\n<string>/the_path_to/startup.sh</string>\n\nBut the path could be changed in different system, so it would be nice if I can use an environment variable for the plist. \n<key>Program</key>\n<string>$HOME/startup.sh</string>\n\nBut it seems plist doesn't support environment variable. When I run the /Library/LaunchDaemons/startup.plist, I got error with message:\nInvalid or missing Program/ProgramArguments \n\nIs there anyway to work around?\n\nA: Plists, or property lists, are just a file format for storing serialized objects - for example configurations or similar. The file format specifies how strings are stores, but it doesn't specify anything about higher level details - such as how file names are stored, parsed or otherwise dealt with.\nThis means that it is not possible to answer your question in general for plists.\nThe interpretation of $HOME, ~ and environment variables in general in plists are thus application specific. For some programs, it could work - for others it wouldn't. Depends entirely on how that program was made.\nUPDATE: You have changed your question to be about LaunchDaemons specifically, and not about plists in general.\nFor /Library/LaunchDaemons/startup.plist it is not possible to refer directly to the environment variables you mention. They're not parsed and replaced with values by launchd. In addition it probably wouldn't have worked like you thought even if they were, because LaunchDaemons are run by root if nothing else is specified.\nWhat you can do is refer a program in the startup.plist that when run can access the environment and do the variable substitution for you. For example like this:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/bin/sh</string>\n    <string>-c</string>\n    <string>exec $HOME/startup.sh</string>\n</array>\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to send a text file from terminal to the Notes App on MacOS? I like how my notes in the Notes App gets synced via iCloud. I spend most of my time in the terminal during the day, so it's convenient for me to keep notes in a text file. At the moment I simply copy-paste my note to the Notes App, so I can review them in bed on my phone. \nCan I skip manual copy-paste and somehow directly push my text file from the command line?\n\nA: The following might do or at least get you started:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\non run argv\n    set unixPath to item 1 of argv\n    do shell script \"sed 's/$/<br>/' '\" & unixPath & \"' > /tmp/tmp\"\n    set bodytext to read POSIX file \"/tmp/tmp\"\n    do shell script \"rm -f /tmp/tmp\"\n\n    tell application \"Notes\"\n        tell account \"iCloud\"\n            make new note at folder \"Notes\" with properties {name:unixPath, body:bodytext}\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend run\n\nSave in a convenient place, make it executable and pass the name of the file to be converted into a note as the first parameter. \nPS: I didn't do a lot of testing on this, so handle with care. It has no error handling at all, so running it without an argument, or with the name of an non existing file will fail in interesting ways. Also, the HTML \"conversion\" is rather rudimentary, any leading spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line will be lost for instance. If a full HTML conversion is needed it might be easier to do this within a shell script first and only use Applescript for the note creation at the end.\n", "Q: How do I convert my mac mini into a remote server?

After researching the problem, I discovered a number of reports indicating the update has failed other users and quickly decided I will wait for Apple to release an \"updated\" update. However, since attempting the failed install, my machine is running so slowly I can hardly use it. It's as if it's trying to move \"under water\". Something as simple as moving a document to a different folder stalls the machine as does opening a Web site. I've tried rebooting to no avail and testing the speed on my IP. I know enough about my Mac to realize that I know very little and am terrified to start opening folders and deleting things without advice from someone who knows what needs to be done. Now that I've revealed that I am a complete computer dodo, I hope not to embarrass myself further.

However, when I clicked restart, my MacBook Pro changed to a black screen with only the cursor showing. The next morning nothing had happened and the only option I had was to do a hard shutdown and restart. When I saw the upgrade had not been installed, I continued after making room on my disk. After several failed attempts, I found information that the update had failed other users with the same circumstances that I encountered. My problem is that I don't know how to clear out the portion of the upgrade that is there and ready to install, that I believe is causing my machine to run so slowly. I've searched many times and ways but can find nothing on how to remove what was downloaded and pending installation after restart.

Even if that fixes the formatting, I'll still reset my phone as I upgraded from 13 to 14 without setting the phone up as new and it's showing its age (iPhone 11 Pro).\nThank you for the thread!\n", "Q: Time Machine alternatives to clone one mac book to another Due to nature of how Time Machine works, backing up or restoring large backups is incredibly slow, even with a USB disk instead of a network attached backup unit.\nAs a result, I am looking for a faster alternative to backup one mac book pro and restore the data on another, in the same manner the Time Machine does.\nCan you suggest any tools/apps to achieve this?\n\nA: Two of the most popular and reliable backup options outside of using Time Machine are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*SuperDuper!\nKeep in mind that using something new is still going to take time to do, as you're going to have to clone your data totally from scratch anyway. \nSo, if you already have a current Time Machine backup, then using that to transfer all your files is certainly a good option. Many people just set it up to do this overnight, so how long it takes isn't really an issue.\nHowever, if you have other reasons for not wanting to use Time Machine, then using Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! are excellent choices.\n\nA: The following is assuming you do not have a current backup in place.  Also I assume that time is somewhat more important than money but not as important as having problems later.\nFor your immediate needs the MacOs setup procedure on a swiped or new Mac can import directly from an existing Mac (which you will want connected with the fastest cabling available to you).  This will get you up and running quickly with a new Mac you want to look exactly as your old, and you can start working.\nThen create a Time Machine backup using an external device (a USB3/Thunderbolt connected SSD would be a good suggestion) and good cabling.  Either do this from your new machine (which I would suggest) overnight or your old one while you use the new one at work.\nWhen that is complete, turn your old Mac in for service.\nThen consider buying a Time Capsule (should still be available somewhere even though Apple discontinued it).  The hourly backup is completely transparent and even if slow to restore, is still better than no backup at all (and somewhat better than a six month old backup).\n", "Q: How to remove username@hostname from terminal bar? currently this is how my terminal bar looks like, it's showing my full name and the hostname.

Thanks!\n\nA: Ok, this might break Time Machine so only follow these steps if you don’t plan on inheriting the backup on the new computer (my MacBook Pro in the above use case).\nStep 1. Navigate to a folder with broken file permissions in a terminal as root (let’s call the folder Things).\nsudo bash\ncd /Volumes/G-DRIVE\\ USB/Backups.backupdb/Sun’s\\ MacBook\\ Pro/2019-07-15-144502/Macintosh\\ HD/Users/sunknudsen/Things\n\nStep 2. Press enter. (If the cd command fails, you probably need to enable Full Disk Access for your terminal, I use iTerm).\n\nStep 3. Once in the folder with broken file permissions (confirm you are in the right folder by running pwd), run the following command.\nsudo find . -user 501 -exec sudo chmod -h -N {} \\; -exec sudo chown -h `whoami` {} \\; -exec sudo chmod -h +a \"group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\" {} \\;\n\nsudo find . -user 501 will find all files owned by user with uid 501 in the current folder.\n-exec sudo chmod -h -N {} \\; is the secret sauce. It will remove access-control list (ACL) rules which prevent us from running a familiar chown -R `whoami` . command to change file ownership.\n-exec sudo chown -h `whoami` {} \\; will change the ownership of the files found by find to the user who is running the command.\n-exec sudo chmod -h +a \"group:everyone deny add_file,delete,add_subdirectory,delete_child,writeattr,writeextattr,chown\" {} \\; will restore the default Time Machine ACL rules (which is optional).\nYou should now have access to the Things folder!\n", "Q: How can I use App Analytics to determine which device models are using my app?

Now I don't have all my notes. I'm afraid of reconnecting to iCloud while the other laptop is still connected for fear of having important files overwritten again. Can I just copy the folders that hold the Notes.app from one to another. My old one is running High Sierra and the new one is Mojave.\nI tried copying the folders relating to notes in both Containers and Group Containers and it didn't seem to work. No notes still on my new laptop.\nI do not want to export them one at a time and then have to reimport them so I was hoping to do it that way. I have a lot of notes. Or is there a \"safe\" way to reconnect to iCloud? I'd like to at least disable Desktop and Documents prior to reconnecting but would rather avoid that altogether.\n\nA: Thanks for the suggestions. I was finally able to get my notes. After backing up my old laptop to a hard drive, I signed off of iCloud. I then signed in to iCloud on my new laptop and it gave me a screen where I could uncheck Documents and data. So I unchecked those. \nAfter hitting Next it brought me into iCloud where I could individually add what I wanted iCloud to store. I only checked Notes. I then started Notes and didn't see all my notes at first, but then noticed there was an iCloud section listed in the sidebar of my  Notes app. Clicking on that showed all my notes from iCloud. However, these notes do not stay with the Notes app when you sign out of iCloud. They disappear even if you tell it to keep a copy of all files on your Mac. So I had to log in again and let it load all my iCloud notes. From there it was an easy task to copy from the iCloud section into new notes in my local h/d section since they were all in the same app. Once I copied them all over (one at a time) they stayed on my new laptop even after signing out of iCloud. \n\nA: You can export all your notes to text files using a 3rd part app, Notes2txt.app, on the App Store. You input a folder name and run the app. Each note is saved in the folder as a separate text file. \nYou can then move the folder to dropbox for example. Make sure other computer has the same service, dropbox, google drive, Box, ...\nNow you can open notes on the new computer and select import. This asks you for the txt file or folder, you wish to add as notes. You then choose the dropbox folder with your notes as textfiles and all the text files in that folder will be stored as notes in the Notes app.\nIf you don't have a service like dropbox you can compress the folder with the notes in it and email it to yourself.

How do I shrink my Ubuntu partition and reabsorb the freed space into my Mac OS Mojave Partition?\nI started with 250 GB SSD, to which I allocated about 65 GB for Ubuntu like 3 years ago. I installed Ubuntu with the help of a friend and online tutorials. I'm not a whiz.\nNow I'd like to shrink my Ubuntu partition. I'm willing to remove it if necessary, but it would be cool to keep it around in case I get into that stuff again. \nSo ideally I'd shrink it by about 40 GB and then add that space back to my main Mac partition.\nI have 4 volumes. 1 is a recovery volume, 1 is the main volume, 1 is the Ubuntu volume, and 1 is something else.

Some to doand not to do. \n\nA: Be sure to write down your password and recovery password on a piece of paper and keep in a safe place. \nBe sure to have your data backed up before you leave. Using filevault reduces or eliminates your chance of third party data recovery apps succeeding ( like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhotoRec ).  Hence, you need to up your backup game.\n\nA: Both of the posts you've mentioned relate to scenarios where users tried to upgrade the OS while the initial encryption process was still running. I've set up several Macs with Filevault in the past years and never had (or heard of) such issues during normal operations. The encryption process even handles sleeps and restarts easily.\nBut if you want to be on the safe side on this, start the encryption process now and keep your Mac running to ensure that it completes before you leave.\n", "Q: How can I export drawing from Notes to an image with background on an iPad?

As you all know, in MacOS Mojave Apple has released a thing called Dark Mode. My problem is that I got used to the previous appearance of dark mode, when there were only dark Dock and Menu Bar. I've found out that I can type a command in Terminal to get back that previous view:\ndefaults write -g NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool Yes\n\nThat worked fine, BUT there is one trouble. Not everything turned white correctly. For example, language switcher stayed as white text above white background, which is not really legible. Brightness and volume regulators stayed as dark cells above dark background, which is similarly illegible. Pictures below:\n\n\n\nAppearance of language switcher was fixed by typing:\ndefaults write com.apple.TextInputSwitcher NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance -bool No\n\nAfter this, it turned fully black (like for regular dark theme), that's fine by me. \n\nI believe, that I can do the same thing to the audio & brightness overlay.

I suspect it is a side effect of installing Gimp, Inkscape, or XQuartz.\nI use the basic/default Terminal profile with no customizations other than switching to /bin/zsh as the default shell.  I'm using Mac 10.14.5.\nHow can I turn off or disable VT100 emulation?\n\nA: \nHow can I turn off or disable VT100 emulation?\n\nYou can't. But you don't want to, either.\nThe DEC VT100 was an early video terminal for computer systems. It introduced a system of control codes which was widely copied by other terminals, and which has become a de facto standard. Virtually all computer terminal applications implement VT100 control sequences, and disabling them would make your terminal unusable.\nThat being said, this message is simply misleading. The resize utility is a weird little component of the xterm terminal emulator, which is distributed with XQuartz. XTerm is not the same as the Mac Terminal application, and it will always print this message when run with two arguments, regardless of what terminal you're using. You can skip this message and force it to resize your terminal by adding the -s flag, e.g.\n/opt/X11/bin/resize -s 50 120\n\n\"s\" stands for \"Sun\", as in Sun Microsystems, which had some terminal emulators which implemented extensions to the VT100 which included a sequence to resize the terminal window. (The VT100 didn't support any such sequence, as it was a hardware terminal and only supported two text resolutions: 80x24 and 132x24.)\nWhy this is necessary at all is… a good question, really. I suspect it comes down to both XTerm and the resize utility it ships with being very old pieces of software.\n\nA: I don't think I was in VT100 emulation mode in the first place.  One of those applications added another program called resize to my path.  I was attempting to call a program called resize that I created based on this answer.  But now that I have resize from X11, I can follow this answer.\n/usr/X11/bin/resize -s width height works without error in Terminal because (from man resize)\n\nThis option indicates that Sun console escape sequences will be  used  instead  of  the\n                 VT100-style  xterm  escape  codes.   If rows and columns are given, resize will ask the\n                 xterm to resize itself using those values.\n\n", "Q: 2010 27\" iMac vs 2011 27\" thunderbolt display I have a 2011 27\" thunderbolt display where the display doesn't light up.

My Airpods are in my ears but the case is missing. It's possible it fell out of my pocket while walking around town. Is it possible to use the Find my iPhone feature to find just the Airpod Case?\n\nA: Unfortunately, you can only find the AirPods themselves. The case itself does not support Find My iPhone. You can order a replacement case under the section “Replace a missing AirPod or case” on this page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207581.\n\nA: Yes, this should be possible as it is the case which uploads its position to the Apple servers - the AirPods which you actually stick into your ears can only play a sound. So if you select your AirPods in Find My iPhone, the location of the case will be displayed. If you have Find My iPhone activated for your iPhone, it will also be available for your AirPods. However, otherwise they will not show up in the app and you will not be able to track their location.\nYou can find more detailed information here:\nhttps://www.google.de/amp/www.iphonehacks.com/2019/03/how-find-lost-airpods-case.html/amp\nGood luck finding your AirPods!\n", "Q: What to do if MacBook Pro 2017 uses more wattage than the charger can give? I wanted to ask, what to do if MacBook Pro 2017 uses more wattage than the charger can give? Why I am asking this or thinking this might be a problem? I tried to play some games on BootCamp (playing games on MacBook is another discussion, no hate please) on settings where I got 60FPS without lag but the problem is that my battery is discharging at the time I am playing. I can not recognize the problem on macOS though.\nIf I bought the mac couple days ago, first they gave me fake charger which f*d up my mac and wouldn't charge at all. Still can not believe that I buy new Mac and get fake charger with it. Then I went back to the store and asked for new Original charger which I then got. I can not see any more problems than the above I described.\nCan anybody tell me what to check, what to do, who to contact with? Any help is much appreciated.\n\nA: You should check the power of your charger and then check the power required for your MacBook Pro. I think you need a 87 Watt charger but smaller chargers will work although they may exhibit the problem you see. You can check the required charger and cables for  your computer here.\nIf your charger is less the 87 Watts your best options are to go back to wherever you bought the computer and explain your problem or buy a new charger from Apple.\n\nA: MacBooks have been able to demand more power from their battery-pack than is available through the charge supply for a long time, but that's because the Mac-top doesn't actually use charger supply to power the computer unless the battery is missing or faulted out of circuit. They run from the battery-pack 100% of the time, even when connected to charge.\nThe battery is organised by the little embedded switching processor into two circuits of cells, and each circuit runs the MacBook whilst the other gets a rapid top-up, and at full load - all cores screaming, data flowing, screen burning and WiFi singing, your MacBook Pro can demand - and receive - as much as 130 watts sustained from the battery pack. So it should be no surprise that you can have it on charge and still see battery-life slipping away.\nAnd there's nothing you can do about that behaviour, other than to reduce the machine's workloads. One can get chargers that can put out over 150 watts over USB-PD, but your MacBoook will never negotiate nor accept more than 87W.\n", "Q: DNS on VPN does not work I have an Azure Point-to-Site VPN over IKEv2 configured and it works well. \nThe problem is with DNS.\n\n\n*\n\n*DNS adresses are filled in Advanced tab of the VPN connection but it does not resolve anything.\n\n*The DNS server is not listed with command scutil --dns\n\n*The VPN connection is not present at output of command scutil --nc list nor with scutil --nwi\n\n*I cannot see the VPN connection entry even on the \"Set service order\" option in Network settings, viz screenshot below (...how humiliating!)\n\n\nWhat is going on?

Answers based on guesses or assumptions will be deleted.\n\nmacOS 10.14.6 was just released.  One of the lines is \"Improves file-sharing reliability over SMB\".  What specifically has changed?\n\nA: Apple does not normally provide the level of detail you seek. It doesn't even provide that level to developers and beta-testers in the pre-release seeds for testing purposes.\nIt may eventually be deduced by sufficient people who used to have a particular problem in that area all reporting some improvement. It may also be uncovered by researchers delving into system files and uncovering relevant strings or other data.\n\nA: As others have noted, any answer is necessarily a guess, but for the benefit of others wondering what this update may be referring to, here is my educated guess.\nThe 10.14.5 version of smbd would frequently hang, causing file sharing clients to hang as well.  The workaround was to disable SIP and revert /usr/sbin/smbd to the 10.14.4 version.  I am guessing/hoping that this update fixes the problem.\nUpdate:\nSo far, the client hangs I experienced with the 10.14.5 version of smbd have not occurred with 10.14.6, so it does appear that the update has fixed that problem.\n", "Q: Bottom of bookmark covered by dock after macbook is upgraded to Mojave On my macbook, the dock is always standing at the bottom, since I never want to use the option \"automatically hide and show\".  On High Sierra, the dock's presence would not interfere the display of the bookmark. Even if there are a long list of entries in the bookmark, it would not be blocked by the dock.

As part of our business model, we do all the licensing for the clients. \nIs it possible to have multiple Enterprise Developer License account for a single DUNS number?\nFor example:\nApple ID Client - Derek's Company XYZ\nEnrollment ID: 1TL2Z8535Z\nD-U-N-S® 1111222334\nUsing this DUNS number, I was able to get an enterprise license for Apple Developer account: Derek.company@xyz.com\nUsing the same DUNS number, can I create an second and a third enterprise license for Apple Developer account, Derek.company_two@xyz.com, and Derek.company_three@xyz.com?\n\nA: I haven’t seen this ever. Most companies end up with too many DUNS numbers and not too many accounts on one. \nI would recommend you guide your clients to make their own developer account - one for each business in their name, with their DUNS and their ultimate control. Have them add your single developer AppleID be added to their accounts. That scales well, protects you and your clients and let’s your team work on different accounts. Then you are an authorized agent on all of the clients that subcontract you to developer and provide them with services.\nI do think you’re trying to do the right thing separating the accounts, just that each company should have its proper address entered correctly. \nYour contract lawyer would be the best person to advise you since I could see you jeopardizing all the accounts if Apple determined you impersonated other entities or didn’t respond legally correct information on the contract you are signing as a developer. \n\nSpecifically, and not even considering getting the accounts approved in the first place, you would likely run afoul of 4.2.6 app review guidelines unless all your clients had the same model and you just submitted one app that aggregates in the “picker” model.\n\n4.2.6 Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app’s content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients and should offer tools that let their clients create customized, innovative apps that provide unique customer experiences. Another acceptable option for template providers is to create a single binary to host all client content in an aggregated or “picker” model, for example as a restaurant finder app with separate customized entries or pages for each client restaurant, or as an event app with separate entries for each client event.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nThere it explicitly warns that the provider of the content should directly submit their apps and that your role is to provide them the tools to submit their own app. If they subcontract that to you, a good contract lawyer can keep you set both as a company, for your clients and to satisfy Apple if asked about the relationship.\n", "Q: How to edit iCloud Photos Library image EXIF metadata on iOS or macOS? I'm using the modern Apple iCloud Photos library on my iPhone and Mac.\nHow can I edit arbitrary EXIF metadata tags for photos in my iCloud Library?\nThe tags must be edited within the Photos.app / iCloud Photos database. I do NOT want to re-import the images, or be forced to make EXIF edits prior to using Photos to import the images.\nA solution using either macOS or iOS to edit the iCloud Photos EXIF data would be acceptable.\nThe \"Get Info\" window can be used to edit some EXIF data in Photos.app on the Mac. You can add a Title, Description, Keyword, and Location. You can also Adjust Date & Time.\nOther EXIF metadata tags such as \"Camera Model\" are displayed, but seemingly cannot be edited.\n\nAs of iOS 15, this camera information EXIF metadata is now also visible in the iOS Photos app:\n\n\nNo camera information\nNo lens information\n\nIn my case, specifically, I have an old digital camera that does not embed Camera Information EXIF. I want to manually add this data to its photos after importing them to my iCloud Library.\nI want to eventually use the Camera Model EXIF tags to create a Smart Album in Photos.app on the Mac containing only the photos taken with this camera.\n\nA: Have you seen this?  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/photos-exif-editor/id1202851767?mt=12.

I want the following:\nInterface: Both command line and GUI that's similar to Time Machine, with optionally verbose output and/or status.\nSpeed: At least faster than Time Machine. My Synology NAS is connected through CAT 5e which is 1 Gbps (the hard disk (RAID 5) is faster, about 200 mb/s). Time Machine will only achieve about 3~5 mb/s (maybe because it backup on to a Sparse Bundle), and stop (0 kb/s) for almost half of the time.\nUtilization of technology: \n1. Listens to fseventsd (which reports which files are modified) for incremental backup, or at least use the fseventsd files (which reports which folders are modified)\n2. Utilize hard link (SMB, NFS*), multi-linked directories (HFS+), or cloning (APFS, btrFS) to save space.\n*Do they actually support hard link? I know that they support symbolic links.\n\nA: Use Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC). It uses APFS snapshot (when backing up to APFS volume) to preserve backup history. The snapshot (backup history) retention policy can be adjusted manually.\nThe newest version (CCC 6) brings fsevents support, providing much faster incremental backup.\n", "Q: Can I use 2019 iMac as monitor for Wii/Wii U? Does anyone know of a setup to somehow plug my Wii into my 27' 2019 iMac?

One LG ultrawide (resolution 2160x1080) and a Full HD Monitor rotated to be vertically upright (resolution would be 1080x1920). \nMy question is: will the Mac render a 1080x1920 image if I select resolution: 1920x1080 and set the rotation to 90 degrees?\n\nA: Yes, simply go into System Preferences->Display.  A new window will pop up on your primary monitors, as well as your external monitors.  The external monitors should have a \"Rotation\" drop down menu, in which you can select \"Standard\", \"90º\", \"180º\", and \"720º\".  If you select \"90º\" and hit \"Scaled\" under the resolution option, you'll see that the standard width and height are all swapped, and that 1080x1920 will be the default option (but you shouldn't have to set it to scaled. Default for Display is probably the best option).\n", "Q: My ssh key won't work on my personal wifi network.

My brother rang me at work today to say I needed to remove VLC media player from my Mac because of some critical security flaw in the program that allows others to remotely run code on my computer.\nThing is, I use it all the time, so this would be a major deal having to remove it.\nMy question is:\nDo I have to remove it, or can I just quarantine it somehow?\n\nA: Assuming you have macOS installed on your Mac and you’re talking about the macOS version of VLC, then you do not need to remove VLC at all.\nAccording to CERT-Bund, the highly respected German security agency that discovered this flaw, only VLC versions written for the Linux, UNIX and Windows platforms are prone to injected malicious code. \nThis issue was first discovered in version 3.0.6 and it is still present in version 3.0.7.1 (see the latest advisory).\nAs an aside, your question about quarantining VLC would not have applied as it’s not a virus as such. The only fix is to download and install a version of VLC in which the code has been fixed. The VideoLAN organisation is aware of the issue and is currently working on a patch, so hopefully it won't be too long for Linux, UNIX and Windows users of VLC.\n\nA: According to TechRadar, “The issue has been detected in the Windows, Linux and UNIX versions of VLC, however the macOS version appears to be unaffected.” In any case it seems that you should be OK if you don’t play untrusted MKV files, and you’ll certainly be OK if you don’t use it until a patch has been installed. \n", "Q: Bluetooth doesn't work after macOS Mojave update I'm new here.

I know that, using the keyboard settings preference pane, you can set \"touch bar shows\" to \"Expanded Control Strip\" to remove the per-app buttons. This mirrors the out-of-the-box configuration on non-touchbar models where the physical F-keys would execute special functions (setting brightness, sound levels, etc), and holding down fn would let you use the normal F1 F2 etc keys.\nI'd like to set the opposite of this (answered in this question) - where the bar always shows the F-keys, and requires holding down fn to access the special functions.\nIs there a way to configure the touchbar in this manner?\n\nA: System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard → Touch Bar shows ‘F1, F2, etc. Keys’.\n\nAlso set ‘Press fn key to Show Control Strip’ to use the Fn key to complete the inverting of the Touch Bar.\n", "Q: How to remove \"where from\" xattr data from image files downloaded in Mac? Hi so I'm at my wits end coz I am trying to remove xattr data in an image file that is a \"Where from\" xattr data. This is on a Mojave mac.\nThis data is written via chrome browser for mac whenever an image is downloaded via this browser.\nSo I tried this command:\nxattr -d com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms test.jpg\n\nbut it shows the following result:\nxattr: test.jpg: No such xattr: com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms\n\nHow do I remove this data from the image file then? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Your command works for me, even copying it and supplying an appropriate filename. As suggested in the comments, you need to ensure that the correct filepath is being supplied, and that the file has the attribute to start with.\nYou can see whether the file has the attribute in a number of ways:\nls -l@ /path/to/filename\n\nOr:\nxattr /path/to/filename\n\n\nA: I believe there is a genuine problem here, not one merely caused by a missing or incorrect path.\nAs far as I can tell google drive prevents xattrs from being deleted in files which are synced from the cloud (i.e. files in the virtual drives which gdrive creates to store local copies of cloud files).\nAn ugly workaround is to move the file to some folder which is not being synced with gdrive (often ones desktop is not synced) and use xattr -d to delete the unwanted attributes there. Once deleted you can move the file to where you like.\nIt is truly odd that one can create and alter xattrs but not delete them, when they are being managed by gdrive. Very unexpected behaviour.\n", "Q: External disk is hijacked by fsck when plugged in to Macbook External disk (2 TB Seagate) is captured by fsck when plugged into a USB 3.0 port on my Macbook Pro (macOS Mojave 10.14.5). This has been discussed by @ArielAllon, and indeed, when I kill the fsck process, the disk is immediately mounted and I can see and read it. When I eject the disk and plug it in again, I always have to kill fsck. I have left fsck running for 12 hours and it never completes. When I kill it, a pop-up warns that the disk could not be repaired.  \nMy problem now, as Ariel mentioned, is that the disk is read-only, owned by root (or wheel?). I would like to use the remaining 150 GB on the disk, (remove old backups, etc) and prevent fsck from capturing it when attached. Thanks for any help...\n\nA: The two items that come to mind are getting software that can try and repair the disk structure and prevent the mounting like Disk Warrior or connecting the drive using a USB write blocker / forensic adapter so that the disk just presents as read-only so you can get any data off it.\nThen, you would wipe the drive if you can’t get it sorted. The native tool will choke on fsck even if you disable the automatic check when it comes time to mount the drive normally.\n\nA: I used to frequently have that problem of waiting for a long time for a USB hard disk to mount while waiting for fsck to complete - due to a defective USB cable that occasionally disconnect the disk. \nClean Unmount\nI have made it a habit to manually unmount the disk from command line\nhdiutil eject disk2\n\nPrevent fsck From Checking\nFrom https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/230712/57733, first get the UUID of the external disk with diskutil list, then edit /etc/fstab with the value\ndiskutil info /dev/diskXsY\nsudo vifs\n# Replace with the UUID of your disk\nUUID=2FECDB7A-15F0-36F9-9A47-483B9669D6DC none exfat rw,auto 0 0\n\nOr a more direct method is to rename the fsck link and binary\nsudo mv /sbin/fsck_exfat /sbin/fsck_exfat.disabled\nsudo mv  /System/Library/Filesystems/exfat.fs/Contents/Resources/fsck_exfat  /System/Library/Filesystems/exfat.fs/Contents/Resources/fsck_exfat.disabled\n\n\nA: I killed the fsck_hfs process with killall and the disk became available to do as I pleased.\n", "Q: Can't sign in to iTunes and App store I own an iPhone SE running iOS 12.3.1.\nI clicked on a webpage link to for Google Translate and got the message that about inability to log in to the App store.  I thought this might be due to the fact that I never log in to iCloud.  In the course of troubleshooting, I changed my Apple ID password, got forced to change my Apple ID from MyOldAppleID to AnEmailAddress@somewhere.com, logged out of iCloud from attempts made today, powered down, powered up, logged back in, got forced to use 2-factor authentication, found that there were two GUI navigation pathways to get to the App Store, and tried them both:\nSettings -> Top option -> iTunes & AppStore\nSettings -> iTunes & AppStore -> Sign In\n\nIn the 1st case, the \"iTunes & AppStore\" field stays \"off\".\nIn the 2nd case, the \"Sign In\" link remains blue, and the area to the right remains blank (I assume that it is unblank if I'm logged in).\nIn both cases, clicking on the App Store \"Retry\" button simply re-displays \"Connot Connect to App Store\"\nI am in a foreign continent across the pond, so have limited options for getting real time forms of assistance.

Not sure if there is an Apple store in Berlin, but not sure that I want to waste the valuable and short amount of time here running around the city fixing the iPhone problem, though frankly, I've already done to a significant degree.  However, I may have to suck up the inability to install a translation app.\nThe only thing that I didn't do was choose to merge my navigator options and contacts with iCloud during the login.  It doesn't seem logical for that to be necessary to access the App Store. I chose to switch to Apple to get away from being at the mercy of the juggernauts in privacy relinquishing ways.  If uploading contacts is needed to in order to access the App Store, then in essence, Apple is holding the phone functionality hostage for not just my own personal data, but also data of everyone I know, who never agreed to having their info in the cloud.  I hope this is not the source of the problem, but it's the only remaining wild card that I can think of right now.\n\nA: It looks like it was just a matter of time before Apple sync'd its user authentication information across services.  The new iTunes login seems to work now, 1.5 days later.\nIt sure would have been nice to be have been notified of this when forced to change the ID, and it would have taken zero effort in the course of developing the change process.\n", "Q: Prevent Mail.app from sending read receipts? I just recently realised that Mail.app sends out \"read receipts\" without my knowledge if someone sends an email with a \"Disposition-Notification-To\" header to my work (MS Exchange) email account. This definitely seems to happen on Mail's side and not on the Exchange server's side where I made sure to turn that functionality off (also in the 'Mobile Devices' settings). \nThere doesn't seem to be any GUI to turn this behaviour off in Mail.app, but maybe someone out there knows of a hidden preference that can be set? Note that if I read my email using the iOS Mail app, then no read receipt is being sent.\n\nA: There are two header tags related to receipts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Return-Receipt-To This is asking for a verification that the mail got to your inbox.  I was surprised that mail responded by sending the original message back to me. macOS 10.10.5  I see this as a minor privacy issue in most circumstances. Could be used to tell if your work computer was powered on and mail app running. \n\n*Disposition-Notification-To This asks for what you did with the email. Mojave gives you some options. I'd display what you have then delete it.\nTo control, Disposition-Notification-To,  you may use terminal comments document on this web page \nhttps://miln.eu/mailreceipt/, see below, or install Mail Receipt which is a free macOS application that adds delivery notification and read receipt requests to your e-mails. https://miln.eu/mailreceipt/\nAs far as I know, you cannot change how mail responds inbound \"Return-Receipt-To\". Mail will always echo back your message to the sender. You can control how mail responds to \"Disposition-Notification-To\" via commands or an app\nTerminal commands:\nI'd display what you have then delete it.

(This is what I do when I must mix the two in ongoing text editing.)\n\n\nBoth are painful. I’d appreciate any trick to make it less so!\n\nA: The smart replacement function is called after the user defined replacement function.

Thats the most common problem with what you are describing.\n\nA: On the macOS end - you have unix heritage and tools, so let's look at how you pick apart which network interfaces have grabbed which addresses and match what the system was told in response to DHCP broadcast. You could enable packet capture / Wireshark if needed, but here are the quick tools I'd use:\nifconfig -uv\nnetworksetup -listallhardwareports\n\nPay attention to the en0 / en5 / en whatever since those are ethernet and not tunnels or wireless discovery interfaces.\nfor me I have ethernet USB adapter (en4)  and WiFi (en0)\nipconfig getpacket en0\n\nSo the likely values you want from the longer list are: \nmac:~ me$ ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep -e addr -e server -e xid\nxid = 0xc9d9ceb7\nciaddr = 192.168.1.27\nyiaddr = 192.168.1.27\nsiaddr = 0.0.0.0\ngiaddr = 0.0.0.0\nchaddr = a8:66:7f:4:d:1\nserver_identifier (ip): 192.168.1.1\ndomain_name_server (ip_mult): {192.168.1.1, 1.1.1.1}\n\nAt this point you'll know if another device is answering DHCP broadcasts or if the Mac has gotten an IP address it wasn't assigned and messing up your network thoroughly. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15\" 2008 freezes with colorful screen Starting a few days ago my Mac froze mid usage, was using Chrome when it did it. I got all these crazy colors everywhere, and it froze.

This looks pretty advanced and you can usually confirm by seeing an external display fail as well.\nIt could be cabling or the LCD, but that’s far less likely. Super rare would be driver or software issue.\nMake sure you have a good backup in case when the GPU fails it takes down the logic board as well. Worst case, removing the drive or booting in target mode is likely to be an easy data transfer if it should stop booting our the display finally fails.\n\nA: As @bmike mentions, the issue is the nvidia GPU. The early 2008 MacBook Pro was later covered under an Apple repair program due to the common event of its nvidia GPU failure. More on that here. Sadly, the machine is well outside the terms of the repair program by now. To be absolutely certain of GPU failure, connect the computer to an external monitor through the machine's DVI port. If the same issue appears on the external monitor, it is certain the issue is not related to the internal video cable running to the LCD. A new logicboard can be found on eBay, used, for roughly $50.

For some reason, iPhone is not happy when a non-USB 3.0 device is active. I'll leave it to someone else to explain exactly why. \nAnyhow, the fix is:\n1) Open Device Manager\n2) Find the \"Universal Serial Bus controllers\" section\n3) Find the USB device that does NOT seems like it's a 3.0 device (in my case it was called \"USB Composite Device\")\n4) Right click on that device, and click \"disable\". \nVoila, my iPhone charges and connects again.\nSee below what my Device Manager window looked like after I disabled the non-USB 3.0 device. \n\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Macbook Air Bootcamp Assistant leads to Windows 10 install error 0xc0000001 Finally managed to get my partition to work, but now when installing Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Home N, or Windows 8.1, none will work and I am prompted with the error code 0xc0000001 loop.

TL/DR: Is there any way to get the latest tvOS SDK, and hack it into my (slightly older) version of XCode, so I can do tvOS development on my machine?\nBackground:\nI need to do some tvOS development.  My AppleTV is running tvOS 12.3.  My Mac is running 10.13.6.  The latest version of XCode that will run on macOS 10.13.6 is version Xcode 10.1, and when I try to connect to the AppleTV, Xcode complains that it is not compatible with tvOS 12.3, and tells me I should update.\nThe last time I tried to update my MacBook Pro beyond macOS 10.13, it failed halfway through, and Time Machine also failed to restore properly.  I lost half a week rebuilding my machine, and still run into things that are not quite right (e.g. execute bits inside app bundles).  I'm not eager to go through that again.\nSo I bought an external 2TB Western Digital hard drive, and tried to install Mojave on that.  After a day and a half of trying, I give up.  It's been nothing but a series of failures.\nSo, I'm now looking for some way to get the latest tvOS SDK (or at least one compatible with tvOS 12.3), and copy it into my current XCode, so I can get on with development?\n\nA: This is obviously not supported and I don't know what wackiness may result from it, (some weird stuff happened when I did it myself) but this is where you find and put the SDK's for specific platforms in an Xcode version.\nOn the new Xcode (the one with the SDK that supports your device/OS/etc.) you can find the SDK bundle itself in \nXcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVOS.platform/Developer/SDKs \n\nThen extract (copy) the tvOS version you want to work with, as well as the simulators if you want to, and put them in the same path in the version Xcode that you currently run. Restart to see if they show up as targets.\nAs I mentioned, this isn't supported at all, and you might face more than trivial issues, but it's a starting point.\n", "Q: 'LocalLibrary' file I'm looking to add a large number of words to my spell checker lexicon.

Since when? I recently noticed that when trying to log into my icloud on either my iphone 7 running ios 12.3.1, or my mac running high sierra, i am required to enter my iphone screen unlock password on ios (for icloud login), and my mac screen unlock login for icloud login on mac os. Since when does apple require you to enter your real passwords for hardware devices just to log into icloud? Seems like a security issue. \n\n\nA: This is likely due to iCloud's end-to-end encryption. According to Apple's iCloud security overview:\n\nEnd-to-end encryption provides the highest level of data security.\nYour data is protected with a key derived from information unique to\nyour device, combined with your device passcode, which only you know.\nTo access your data on a new device, you might have to enter the\npasscode for an existing or former device.\n\n", "Q: Problems with using HP 27fw external display on a MacBook Pro when running macOS I am using a MacBook Pro 2017 running on macOS High Sierra. When I use it with the HP 27fw external display the quality of display output is not good. The fonts are not sharp and overall the resolution is not good. I have set the font smoothing when available option. Still the fonts does not appear correctly.\nHowever, when using the MBP with windows the fonts are displayed correctly.\nHow can I troubleshoot this?\n\nA: If by HP27fw you mean this display, then you may have gotten a fairly low end 27 inch display.\nFor example on my work PC (Optiplex 7060, Win-10) I have three Dell 24-inch displays that are set to their native resolution of 2560 x 1440. So, you ask, what does that have to do with my display on my Mac? Glad you asked.\nThe specs of that monitor say\n\nRecommended Resolution 1920 x 1080 @ 60 Hz (FHD)\n\nAnd it makes no mention of any other resolutions that are supported.\nSo what you have here is a monitor that is 3-inches larger than one of my displays and yet it has a lower resolution.\nWhile the display resolution of a monitor can have a lot of different available resolutions a good quality display that supports a resolution that will look good on your Mac at 27-inches is probably closer to 2560 x 1440. And if you want a really high end display at the 27-inch size look at a 5K display at 5120 x 2880.\nI would say that you got a display that will work with your Mac, however it will not work well with your Mac and you need to get one with a higher native resolution to properly display the video output the Mac is capable of.\n", "Q: Migration Assistant estimated time remaining keeps climbing I'm trying to move my files, applications, and system preferences from a Early 2015 Macbook Pro to a 2019 MBP. Here are the steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Got an external hard drive and used it for Time Machine backup of my\nold Mac. The total backup was close to 105 GB. \n\n*Booted up the new Mac, created my user account on it with the same name. \n\n*Connected the drive to new Mac, Opened \"Migration Assistant\" on it, and selected Time Machine\nBackup as the option.\n\n*On the screen where it asks select the data\nyou want to transfer, All the checkboxes were selected by default,\nso I did not wait for \"Estimating File Size\", and just clicked on\nNext.\n\n\n\n\n\n*I chose to replace the existing user on the New Mac, whilst not keeping any files from it.\n\n\n \n\n\n*Hit Continue and let the process start.

However, with every passing second, the ETA is increasing. It has been an hour since I recorded 18 hours, and it is now at \"57 hours 42 minutes remaining\" (and counting).\n\n\n\nAlso, the progress bar has not moved significantly. I can barely make out any movement. \nIs this by any means normal? Should I leave it overnight, knowing that the ETA is not coming down, rather climbing? Or should I cancel it while I can?\nI read in a few places that choosing to overwrite existing user account causes this, and advised to create a new user. But there was not enough validation on that post. \n\nA: macOS progress and completion estimates are often based on the number of bytes transferred.  But one large file will usually transfer much faster than many small files even if they add up to the same size.  What may be happening here is that the transfer started with some large files, went quickly, and resulted in an optimistic estimate.  But now it is into small files which take longer and so the estimate is growing.\nThe estimate and speed can also be affected by the type of storage, whether the migration assistant is trying to do other tasks at the same time, whether FileVault is enabled, the type of connection for the backup volume, etc.  All of those factors can magnify the differences in file sizes as well as cause variability on their own.\nMake sure both the backup volume and the new MacBook are plugged into their respective power supplies and give it some time.  The worst case scenario is a hardware problem with either the backup or the MacBook, but give it a few more hours before jumping to that conclusion.\n", "Q: MBA 2017 won't boot up in macOS, but will in Ubuntu A few days ago my spouse's MBA started showing problems. At first it wouldn't turn on at all, showing an orange indicator on the MagSafe charger. After resetting the SMC a couple times and letting it charge for a long time it booted up.\nIt showed the regular login screen but it wouldn't complete the login, it'd just sit on the end of the progress bar.\nI tried booted in recovery mode, single mode, internet recovery mode, and afterwards a freshly made USB macOS Mojave installer I made on my MacBook Pro 2018. \nNone of the above complete the boot up. Instead, it sits forever on the 100% progress bar. I started the Mojave installer in verbose mode and I see an \"Unsupported CPU\" and \"Unsupported PCH\" in the log.\n\nI was able to boot up a live Ubuntu USB and everything seems ok. I installed the Ubuntu on the main disk to see if there was a problem with the disk at all. Ubuntu runs just fine on the MBA.\nAny ideas on what else can I try?\n\nA: While the \"Unsupported CPU\" and \"Unsupported PCH\" messages in the log appear concerning, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that this is what's causing the problem. The fact is I've seen these messages before in Macs that run perfectly fine.\nI see you've already reset the SMC, but you haven't mentioned resetting the NVRAM and this is something you should also do.\nReset your NVRAM\nFor your model MBA you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBA \n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again (i.e. wait until you've heard the startup chime a second time)\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBA reboot. \n\n\nIt's not clear to me if you still have macOS installed or not:\n\n\n*\n\n*If not, then shut down your Mac again and switch it on and immediately press the option key and let me know what drive options (if any) appear on the screen.\n\n*If so, what happens when your MBA boots up after the NVRAM reset?\n\n", "Q: Generating a mask png from a color image? Apple requires certain icons to be monochrome masks with transparency in png  file format.\nHow (on macOS, using a built-in app, such as Preview, or an app in the App store, such as Pixelmator) can I convert an existing color image (png file), so that one color (a background) becomes transparency, and everything else becomes either pure black or pure white?\nIs it then possible to invert a mask? (transparency becomes black or white, and any non-transparent areas becomes transparent)\n\nA: You can do this in Photoshop, & I would imagine Pixelmator or any other decent graphics package could in a similar manner…\nInvert Colour can also be done in Gimp - freeware, open source. If you want to use Gimp, then I'd recommend this Mac-specific build from https://www.partha.com/ which looks & feels far more 'Mac-like' than the official build.\nLoad your image, use the Magic Wand or equivalent to select the background.\n\nLayer Menu > Layer Mask > Hide selection\n\nYou've now generated the basic mask shape.\nThe next bit is a bit fiddly, but you can automate it for future use.\nOpt/click this new mask, then select all. Copy, click the picture item in the Layer, Paste. This will generate a new layer containing the black & white image of your mask.\n\nDrag your original mask to the new layer (both thumbnails will then look the same.)\nDisable your original layer to save confusion.\nClick the main image in the thumbnail & Invert (Cmd/i)\nThat's your first mask. Save as png.\nPNG with transparency is a 32-bit file rather than 24. Some apps differentiate this way, others including Photoshop have a dedicated \"save Transparency\" option which changes the bit depth for you.\n\nUndo the Invert (or Invert again) then Opt/click the Mask & Invert.\nThat's your 2nd mask. Again save as png.\n\nYou could, of course, do each of these as a new layer, then saving your file as PSD or other native format would preserve all assets in a single file.\n", "Q: Apple Magic Keyboard on Windows 10 not a Bootcamp!

Since the reg-entry is called \"KeyMagic\" I guess it must have somehow ended up on my system (Windows 10). So you might have to use the other steps there.\nI tried a ton of tools from the net - none worked, as they use the Bluetooth connection, which the Mac A1243 keyboard doesn't have. Other suggestions were to change BIOS settings, but they don't affect external keyboards. And there is no key combination on this apple keyboard to that fn-unlocks again.\n", "Q: Restoring to another iPhone Do I need to reset my iPhone before restoring a backup of a different phone?

Sometimes my MacBook shows a \"Performance is reduced\" notification after it gets hot from running intensive apps on a hot summer day.  \nWhen it's left idle for about 30 minutes and becomes cooler, is there a way to manually increase the performance back to its normal level without having to reboot the Mac?\nOr, when the Macbook is left idle for a couple of hours, will it automatically go back to the usual performance and how can you tell?\n\nA: I installed the Intel Power Gadget to check if anything can be shown.\nThen one time I left YouTube running, showing 1080p, and placed the Macbook 12 inch on the bed, and an hour later, I saw that the notification said CPU performance has been reduced, and Intel Power Gadget showed:\n\nso it seems like the Blue Line (for the processor) is showing that it was running at 1GHz.\nAnd then I stopped YouTube, and put something under the Macbook so that it can ventilate better under the notebook base. After 30 minutes, without rebooting the machine, I ran YouTube again and some other apps, and the Intel Power Gadget showed the Mac running at 2GHz or above again. So it looks like the processor speed got bumped up back to normal, but it won't show you any notification:\n\nP.S. When I have some apps running and Google Chrome running with a dozen tabs, the temperature kept on being 60°C and it won't jump back up to the 2GHz range. I had to quit the apps and Chrome and the temperature went down to 50°C, and after about 30 minutes the Macbook went back up to 2GHz. By the way, the processor can go up to 90°C and it was a bit scary... it is almost enough to boil some water.\n", "Q: RAM upgrade for an iMac 27\" 2017 used for video-editing, compression and audio recording I have a 27\" iMac (2017) - 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7 - Radeon Pro 580 8 GB - 16GB DDR4 running macOS Mojave 10.14.6.\nI do a lot of video editing, compression and record a lot of Live DJ Sets with a Pro DJ Suite.\nAt this point, the video editing and compression is going 'ok', but if it could be a little bit faster, I would not mind.\nIn light of this work, would upgrading the memory from 16GB to 32GB be useful?\nIn other words, if I add an extra 16GB to the system, will I have better results* when working on video files? \n*Better results = faster completion.\n\nA: I'm a big believer in having more RAM generally, but of course in many situations having more RAM isn't warranted. In your case, however, having more RAM is going to be useful because of the type of tasks you're using your iMac for. \nThe key spec missing from your question, however, is the type of storage you have. If your iMac has one of the Fusion drives, then you'll get more out of your extra RAM than you will if you have an internal SSD. This is because macOS will use your storage device for virtual memory when it doesn't have enough RAM available.\nIn summary, if your internal drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*is a Hybrid/Fusion drive, then definitely upgrade your RAM.\n\n*is an SSD, then strongly consider upgrading your RAM\n\n\nA: Yes RAM will help both with multitasking and having more is even more important with a fusion drive (from what I understand). If you want an even faster experience you might want to consider buying an external SSD and running most of your workload from that (and having internal fusion drive for archive and backups).\n", "Q: Is there a way to enable Two-factor authentication for my apple id without any physical device?

Specifically there's a site called gab.com that's about free speech and has attracted a number of radical people. Because of this it has been banned form the Apple app store, even in its more recent iterations as it moved into the fediverse. \nI was thinking of forking their old app and making a third party app that blocked sensitive content, hopefully making the app acceptable for the app store (since the previous one was banned due to hate speech).\nI'd hate to go through all that work just to have Apply say they won't allow it anyways.\nIf I want to create an app in a sensitive subject area, is there a way to contact Apple before making the app to see if they'll allow it or not?\n\nA: The short answer is once you are a paid developer, you have paid support from developer relations. I can't imagine apple would offer anyone an unofficial or cursory \"you're good\" without seeing the app\nThe good news is Apple now has clearly worded and very specific public guidance on what app review considers and specific items relating to safety.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nApple’s review guidelines should help you decide if you want to pay the $100 to get a proper response from Apple on your specific implementation of a front end to that site. (Even if there is an API to let you host it - seems the site is having problems getting hosted and has moved to paid only access)\nSection 1 on safety has all you should need to decide if “free speech” means you cannot or choose not to control bullying and hateful speech.\n\n1.1.1 Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or place a targeted individual or group in harm’s way. Professional political satirists and humorists are generally exempt from this requirement.\n\nThe bar for publishing free speech apps is that you would be held accountable for Apple’s definition of ensuring some level of safety for people that download your app.\n\nTo prevent abuse, apps with user-generated content or social\n  networking services must include:  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*A method for filtering objectionable material from being posted to the app\n  \n*A mechanism to report offensive content and timely responses to concerns\n  \n*The ability to block abusive users from the service\n  \n*Published contact information so users can easily reach you\n  \n\nNow, how you value your time - I would presume you'd spend 10x on legal advice so you understand the contract you sign to become a developer over the $100 Apple charges to be a developer.\nThe hierarchy of control is pretty easy to see, though if you step back from the details of app review. From most strict to least strict Apple services:\n\n\n*\n\n*Most restricted is if your app contains items that might be adult or objectionable or hateful. Expect Apple to carefully look at an application that has  something widely understood to have racial undertones like a Nazi Swastica or a US Confederate flag. Based on the country in which you want to sell that app, expect to handle sensitive content with care.\n\n*Less restricted is if your app is a portal to user generated content. You absolutely have to disclose this, but there may be more latitude to pass review when you’re not embedding the content in your app.\n\n*Even less restricted is of your item is a book or music item - that is about expressing your artistic and intellectual ideas and not that Apple endorses your lyrics or writing.\n\n*The most free speech friendly expression is a web app - just make your Applications into a progressive web app or offline web app and there is no review. Anyone interested in participating in free speech is free to run your app without Apple or anyone else reviewing it. (Except perhaps the government where people live)\n\n\nI would say, think about why your app has to be on the App Store and not a web app if it’s just a discussion forum or place for people to gather. Free speech generally restricts governments and not platforms and companies like Apple or even Stack Exchange which all publish guidelines restricting speech on their platforms.\n", "Q: Three-finder side swipe between apps lagging, swiping up for mission control and then side-swiping produces no lag I am experiencing something like a 1-3 second lag only when side-swiping with 3 fingers between apps/desktops. \nHowever, if I first swipe up with 3 fingers to enable mission control, then everything is fine and I can swipe between desktops seamlessly. \nI've noticed that if I run 3 fingers across the trackpad, then I'll eventually be able to switch between desktops.

I just went to Apple's website (July 2019) to find the maximum processor spec of a 15-inch Macbook Pro to be: 2.4GHz 8‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor, Turbo Boost up to 5.0GHz\nHowever, my Macbook Pro (15-inch, 2018) has a processor spec of 2.9 GHz Intel Core i9. Update: After reading the answer where six cores is important, I found the more official spec from Apple: 2.9GHz 6-core Intel Core i9, Turbo Boost up to 4.8GHz\nWhy has the processor speed gone down? Does it have anything to do with the heat problems I heard about in 2018?\n\nA: Your question is actually based on a wrong assumption, namely that you're interpreting the specs of the current 2019 MacBook Pros as being lower than those for the 2018 models.\nUsing your specific example, you're citing the 2.4GHz processor in the top 2019 model and comparing that to the 2.9GHz processor in the top 2018 model. However, you're only looking at part of the picture:\n\n\n*\n\n*The top 2018 MacBook Pro has a 2.9GHz (Core i9) processor with six cores. \n\n*The top 2019 MacBook Pro has a 2.4GHz (Core i9) processor with eight cores. \n\n\nAt the risk of oversimplifying things with this analogy, having eight cores compared to six cores is like having eight people v six people trying to do some heavy lifting. In most cases, eight people each capable of lifting 50kg each is better than having six people each capable of lifting 60kg each. Worse, not all problems can be evenly or efficiently divided, so having 7 people standing idle while one works is more the norm and the entire system balance is far more important than any fractional increase or decrease in core count or speed measuremen. Those only matter when all the other primary factors are perfectly equal which usually happens only in benchmarks or hours long video rendering exercises. \nTo put this into perspective, testing both these MacBook Pros using the same benchmarking tests, we get the following results:\n\nInformation on how to interpret these results is available here\nIn summary, the above chart shows:\n\n\n*\n\n*2018 MacBook Pro (2.9GHz) achieves a single core score of 5,335 and a multi-core score of 22,432\n\n*2019 MacBook Pro (2.4GHz) achieves a single core score of 5,658 and a multi-core score of 30,151\nSo, as you can see, the newest MacBook Pro specs are not lower than those of the 2018 models.\n", "Q: Where is the original file for the default Contacts profile picture located?

I recently bought a 2019 mac book pro and am a new user to mac os, it has been quite the learning curve and there are still many quirks and features I don't quite like about mac os understand.\nFor example, whenever I open any app, its never in a \"full-screen\" mode, such that there is always some space thats unoccupied, and if you accidentally click outside of the minimized default screen then you lose / hide / minimize that window.\nSo that is why I downloaded Spectacle. But everytime, I have to use option+command+F to make my current window or all windows I'm using to full screen. \nIs there a way I can automatically do this with certain apps and programs but not with others?\nFor example, I'd like to be able to open full screen but still have my menu bar up top to display without having to hover over it to display like in Word, or Chrome, but in other places such as opening a program installer, I don't need the full window size and a smaller size is better.\nIs there a macro or something I do to set this up?\nThanks.\n\nA: I set my windows to what size I like. Here is how I use my web browser. \n\nYou can adjust the windows to what size you like.  The come back to that size the next time you start. \n\nFor some reason, Windows seems to want you to work on one app at a time in full screen.  In the mac, I have multiple apps open at once. \nOne of the great features of macOS for me, is to use a keyboard manager, keyboard maestro.  I have set up F2 to be mail, f5 to be edit html, f4 to be a web browser, f8 to be bbedit and shift f12 to be activity monitor.  The neat thing is you can press these key to start the app or switch to the app.  Thus, there is no worry about whether the app is running or not. Thus, when I press f4, I get my web browser.

I am using the following layout for two Airport Time Capsules.\n\nThe second augments (wirelessly) the network of the first. The objective is to have backup redundancy, while still not bothering with managing disks and scheduling backups.\nI can \"Enter Time Machine\" and see the history, but it's unclear which history this is. Is it the first Time Machine? Is it the second? Is it a merge of both?\nI can also run from the Terminal sudo emacs -nw and view /Volumes/mybackup[1,2]/MyMacBook Pro.sparsebundle/bands, but even then I can't see inside bands (or I'm losing patience before the contents of a large directory listing appear). Neither can I run a simple\nsudo ls -l \"/Volumes/mybackup1/My MacBook Pro.sparsebundle/bands/\"\n\nHow do I confirm that a backup is being made on each disk?\nI am hoping there is a better answer than to turn one or the other off and do a singleton setup.\n\nA: I love having two destinations and the best way to check is to force two backups, rotating between them each. You’ll know if the file system are clean, the metadata correct and be able to see the actual timing needed to back up to each. \ntmutil startbackup --rotation --block && tmutil startbackup --rotation --block\n\nYou will get timing on the backup and can monitor the status in another shell\ntmutil status\n\nAn alternate method would be to get a tool designed to parse the backup manifest like BackupLoupe\nFocusing on the bands which are a binary representation of the file system seems like a lot of work when you can just mount the file system and look at the files stored. Each backup interval has a plist file showing what happened on that backup interval.\nSide answers to side questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*no the format for sparse bundles isn’t changing - when they fail to mount, you are likely going to either lose the data or wait a very long time and find out you can't write data to that destination again. By long time, I mean a week or more in some cases to repair or check a sparse disk on TimeCapsule due to the slow processor and massive IO count to perform filesystem checks of Time Machine hard links. \n\n*When you have multiple destinations, the default behavior is to try for round robin, so with two connected destinations, odd hours would go to one destination and even hours to the other. So if you never sleep, instead of 24 intervals going to one destination (default case when you have only one drive) - you would get 12 backups to each of the two. If the machine sleeps, it should track roughly odd/even and the only imbalance happens when one of the two isn’t connected, the system prefers the “correct” destination, but will back up sequential intervals to the remaining destination if it’s the only one that mounts when requested.\n\n", "Q: How to open the wifi sign-in page when it doesn't pop up automatically One time I was at a hotel and I couldn't access the free wifi because the sign-in window didn't pop up.\nSince every webpage has a URL, is it possible to get to the wifi sign-in page through a browser (Google Chrome)?\nKnowing how to do this is good for future reference, in case I experience problems connecting to wifi networks again.\n\nA: When the log in gets eaten by other software or times out, just open your chosen web browser and navigate to http://captive.apple.com\nSome interesting tidbits: \n\n\n*\n\n*How captive.apple.com is used by non-Apple devices?\n\n*How to disable captive.apple.com?\n\n*A clear question and answer on implementing a captive portal with key triggers documented for multiple vendors and versions of OS\n", "Q: Identify Menu Bar App — Up Arrow Line Underneath There is an up arrow with a line underneath it in my menu bar.

One book listed the \"MacBook Pro's Default Function keys.  Went something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*F1            Descreases display brightness\n\n*F2.           Increases display brightness\n.\n.\n.\n\n*F11           Decreases volume\n\n*F12           Increases volume\n\n\nI've omitted some of the F numbers.\nMy issue is that none of these work for me. Zero.\nWhen I press the \"fn\" key the F1 thru F12 show up in the Touch Bar and when I press F1 - F10 nothing happens.  When I press F11 the browser screen minimizes, and when I press F12 I go to the dashboard (I actually like this).\nIn the Touch Bar I notice that I have by default a volume up and volume soft key.\nMy question is, why doesn't pressing F4 (fn key and the F4 key that shows up in the Touch Bar) open the launchpad (I think this is the default )?  Why doesn't F3 open the Mission Control?\nI'm just trying to fully understand this machine and this is a hole in my understanding.\nI'm using MacOS 10.14. Mojave.\nand it says Kernel version Darwin 18.6.0 (whatever that means).\nBTW, I have, under system preferences, keyboard, press fn key to \"show F1, F2...\".\nI have also gone to system preferences an keyboard shortcuts and pressed the restore defaults.\nCan anyone assist with what I'm doing wrong here to not be able to get the default function keys to do their default functions.  \n\nA: I believe you are misunderstanding the information you read.\nOn older MacBook Pros, the top row of function keys double as system settings keys just as they do on PCs, but with one important difference:  On a PC, the top row keys act as function keys primarily, and you use the Fn key to use the secondary setting. Macs default to the exact opposite of this. The top row of keys act as settings keys primarily, and you use the Fn to use them as regular function keys. This can be confusing to newcomers at first.\nThis also adds ambiguity into the documentation you found. It says that F1/F2 adjust the screen brightness, but F1 and F2 don't actually do anything. The screen brightness controls are just ON the F1/F2 keys.  The documentation knows that the primary and secondary functionality of the function keys is reversed on Macs, so that's why it said to use just F1/F2.\nLastly, I said in my first paragraph that older MacBook pros act this way. Newer MacBook Pros with the Touch Bar do not have a row of function keys. The Touch Bar always displays whatever function will happen when you touch it. When you press the Fn key, it shows the function keys because that's how older models would behave.\nJust remember, you're not actually after the F-keys. You're after the functions that used to be on those keys when there was an actual row of function keys instead of a touch bar.\nMake sense?\n\nA: The first thing I would do is reset your NVRAM.\nResetting the NVRAM\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on your MacBook Pro model follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, so go to Apple > Shut Down so you’re not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button (in your case this is the Touch ID button) and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nIf resetting the NVRAM doesn't resolve this, let's try the on-screen keyboard. \nUse the on-screen keyboard\nFor troubleshooting purposes (not as a solution) let's see what happens if you use the on-screen keyboard to access function keys instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Click on the Keyboard pane\n\n*Tick the “Show Keyboard, Emoji and symbol viewers in menu bar” box (Note: The exact phrase will differ slightly depending on version of macOS).\n\n*Choose the viewer icon in the menu bar (see below for how the icon looks)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Choose Show Keyboard Viewer.\n\n*When the on-screen keyboard appears, click on the function keys to see what happens.\n\n\nLet me know how you go and we'll progress further if needed.\nDisplay function keys by default for specific apps\nIn case it's of interest to you, you can set your Touch Bar to show the function keys as its default display on an app by app basis.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences\n\n*Select the Keyboard preference pane\n\n*Click on the Shortcuts tab\n\n*In the left sidebar, select the Function Keys option\n\n*On the right-hand side click on the plus + button\n\n*Select the app you want to have the function keys displayed for in the Touch Bar by default\n\n*Add the app\n\n\nNow, whenever you are using that app, the Touch Bar should display all the function keys.\n", "Q: macOS Catalina beta could not be verified I'm trying to install the latest beta on my MacBook and always get the message at the end:\n\nmacOS Catalina beta could not be verified\n\nAny suggestions how to solve this?\n\nA: I just retied and it worked out of the box.\nDon't know what the error was, I did not change nothing.\n\nA: Are you scripting your download:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a script I can use to download the Mojave installer without being signed in to the App Store?\nThat can help isolate things in my experience. \n\nA: change Date&Time to “Apple Americas / U.S. .....”\n", "Q: How to restore Dock Icon Badges after killall Dock?

After I had a disturbing discussion with an Apple engineer I realized that Catalina is heading at us like a freight train right now - and not necessarily in a good way, but acceptation is going to be mandatory by Apple. In my case and revelation, I've been having some troubles with macOS over the last several months with performance on Mojave and it appears that these issues have been resolved in Catalina, but we're not going to see a \"back port\" of these fixes in Mojave. This is a double edged sword for some of us who need to run 32-bit programs still!\nSo this leads me to the question: what realistic options are we looking at for being able to run 32-bit apps when we must to step into Catalina?\nThus far the only practical solution that's come to my mind is using Mojave or High Sierra in Parallels via Coherence or another VM. Some projects like Darling (via Linux; imagine Wine for macOS apps instead) are just not yet quite mature enough to be viable. Are there other options that will facilitate running 32-bit apps that we just can't run without when Catalina becomes a proverbial \"necessary evil?\"\n\nA: I guess it depends on what you mean by realistic options?\nIn summary though, the three best options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*use a virtual machine (as you've already mentioned)\n\n*use a second boot disk (e.g. an external drive, another partition on your internal drive, etc) that has another version of macOS installed and boot from that as required\n\n*have a second Mac with another version of macOS installed. Depending on the Mac model, with this option you could also use the Mac in Target Disk Mode to boot your primary Mac if/when required.\n\n\nWhich ones of the above are the most realistic will depend on your individual circumstances.\n", "Q: Screenshot to clipboard by default My muscle memory is very ingrained with Cmd + Shift + 4 to take screen snips, and this has been fine for a while.\nHowever, from now on, I don't need to save my screen snips as files.

I am located in a German-speaking country, so the autodetected (or pre-installed?) keyboard layout was German.\nI work as an English-speaking programmer, so I need e.g. the tilde ~. I have added the US keyboard layout. But for some reason, on a Mac, that is next to Shift. The button on the laptop's keyboard, where ~ normally is, on Mac it writes §.\nHow can I set a US keyboard on a Mac with this layout that can be found in Linux?\n\nSource\n\nA: Having tilde next to the left shift is normal for Apple ISO (European) English keyboards.  If you want to put it somewhere else, you will have to use an app like Karabiner or Ukelele to customize the layout.\nIf using an external keyboard is acceptable, you could try to get an ANSI (US) keyboard (with no key between z and shift) someplace.  It will have the tilde below ESC.\nDo not use the layout called \"US International PC\", since it treats tilde as a dead key for making accented characters, and requires extra steps to create an ASCII tilde.\nHere is a custom US layout that should put tilde under escape.\n\nA: You could also try to use karabiner (elements).\n\nThis will change Fn ←→ ctrl and\nwill put ~ below esc touchbar/above tab (and ±§ next to shift key).\nThis worked for me on macOS Big Sur (Karabiner 13.xx) and on macOS Catalina (Karabiner 12.xx version).\n", "Q: Update MacOS on a MacBook with dead battery I have a macbook 12'' running sierra that I use occasionally.\nThe battery died some time ago, showing an X in the status bar.\nI want to update to a new version of macOS but the installer shows: \n\nYour computer is not connected to a power source.\n  You must plug in and connect your power adapter before installing.\n\nObviously the device is connected to the power source (the battery is dead). \n\nI have already done the SMC reset. Didn't help.\nSo:\nCan I convince the updater to install despite the fact that it thinks I am on battery power?\nAlternatively:\nCan I convince the system to recognize my power connection as an actual power connection? \n\nA: Well baring the obvious and replacing the bad battery you will probably have to install the OS on a different computer and reinstall the hard drive.  The Mac power module is not responding that the laptop is connected to AC but responding that the battery is bad.  Apple will replace the battery for $199 so keep that in mind while doing any work around.\nYou can also put this MacBook in USB target mode and run the installer from another Mac to perform the upgrade without fixing the hardware. The battery service there is relatively labor and parts expensive due to the thin assembly, delicate cabling and glue that makes the cells part of the case structure. You’re getting a partial frame replacement when the battery is exchanged for $200 and possibly new top case / keyboard if the cabling or parts don’t fit when it’s out for repair. \n\nA: I have finally gotten around this without battery replacement (will do another time, not an option right now): \n\n\n*\n\n*Use Disk Utility to create a second partition\n\n*Make the second partition a bootable installer\n\n\n*\n\n*follow these instructions http://osxdaily.com/2018/09/29/download-full-macos-mojave-installer/ to download a full installer\n\n*run a command similar to this (adapt paths)\nsudo ~/Downloads/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Mojave\nto turn the new partition (/Volumes/Mojave) into a boot disk\n\n\n*Restart the computer while holding 'ALT'-key to choose the start volume\n\n*Chose the new volume with the installer\n\n*Follow the usual steps to install the OS.

That is, that the results will show messages with either 'TagA' or 'TagB'?\n\nA: Looks like the filtering criteria work with OR operator when they use the same property shortcut (e.g. any: for Any, p: for Process, m: for Message, t: for Message Type).\nThey work with AND operator when they are using different property shortcuts. At least in macOS 12 Mojave.\nExamples:\nt:error t:fault - The default saved search \"Errors and Faults\" searches for Errors OR Faults.\nm:roam p:wifi - Shows messages containing \"roam\" AND in process containing \"wifi\".\nNote: a trick how to search for message containing two phrases is using m: AND any: instead of m: OR m:, for example any:transitioning message:operation.\nYou can also search for a phrase containing spaces, e.g. m:transitioning from state.\n", "Q: My icon for photo is missing not only from dock but from launch pad on my MacBooks Air I have tried the rebuild but when I relaunch launchpad still does not show the photo icon.

I have a 2019 BMW X2 with Carplay. The audio quality is noticeably worse with Carplay than through USB or even Bluetooth. \nCarplay apparently transmits the audio via a wi-fi connection the phone makes with the car's head unit. It's higher bandwidth than Bluetooth, so Apple claims it can transmit lossless audio without recompression to the head unit. But it doesn't sound that way. (I watched a WWDC developer video from Apple that explained this)\nI've played music through Tidal & Apple Music. They both sound the same through Carplay. Thin, lacks clarity. Doesn't really sound like mp3/aac compression though.\nDoes anyone know what codec/protocol is used to trasmit audio to the head unit? Anyone else experience this? I want to know whether this is a problem with Carplay or just the head unit's implementation of it.\n\nA: Apple’s consumer documentation says you need a unit with Bluetooth or WiFi for wireless and I expect it uses both when paired and available. You’d need to measure the RF to tell which is being used from moment to moment or check console logs for any debug messages. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205634\nA slightly longer answer is that the technical details are not public and neither is the API / SDK other than this technical detail that explains the app simply hands off the media container or media with title, streaming Boolean, artwork and percentage played...\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mediaplayer/mpcontentitem\nThe details on the SDK are shared with MFI partners. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22372095/is-ios-carplay-api-public-how-to-integrate-carplay/38541642#38541642\nAs a developer, you don’t need to be MFI, just hand off your media to the player and it will play through.

My Problem\nI am using Google 8.8.8.8 DNS, and would like to use its Secure transports for DNS\n feature to make sure nobody is messing with the communication channel between Google and my Mac.\nWhat Have I Tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Configuring the DNS from the network tab. Did not find any secure option there.\n\nMy Question\nHow do I configure MacOS to use a secure (DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH))\n connection?\n\nA: The easiest system-wide option is to use the third party utility “dnscrypt-proxy”:\nhttps://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy\nFollow their macOS guide to download, install and configure the program. This will essentially setup your system to that System Preferences show that your DNS server is 127.0.0.1 (localhost), which means that all programs using the system resolver sends their DNS requests to the proxy program running on your computer. The proxy program then handles the communication with external DNS servers using encryption.\nYou can download “dnscrypt-proxy switcher” to be able to quickly switch on/off the proxy usage from the menu bar.\nAnother possibility is to use only programs that in themselves support DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS. This is for example Firefox or Google Chrome. However, extra configuration is necessary.\n\nA: In MacOS Big Sur and later, the secure transports (DNS over HTTPS, and over TLS) are supported by the operating system.\nPaul Miller has a blog post describing their usage, linking to his GitHub page of suggested configuration profiles.  To install on MacOS, go to your Profiles preference pane, and choose one of these profiles from there, as described by Apple on their support page.\nHere, I quote Miller's profile for Google DoH:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>PayloadContent</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>DNSSettings</key>\n            <dict>\n                <key>DNSProtocol</key>\n                <string>HTTPS</string>\n                <key>ServerAddresses</key>\n                <array>\n                    <string>2001:4860:4860::8888</string>\n                    <string>2001:4860:4860::8844</string>\n                    <string>8.8.8.8</string>\n                    <string>8.8.4.4</string>\n                </array>\n                <key>ServerURL</key>\n                <string>https://dns.google/dns-query</string>\n            </dict>\n            <key>PayloadDescription</key>\n            <string>Configures device to use Google Encrypted DNS over TLS</string>\n            <key>PayloadDisplayName</key>\n            <string>Google DNS over HTTPS</string>\n            <key>PayloadIdentifier</key>\n            <string>com.apple.dnsSettings.managed.f0ffd552-7183-4f2e-86e5-ee1ecad2a53a</string>\n            <key>PayloadType</key>\n            <string>com.apple.dnsSettings.managed</string>\n            <key>PayloadUUID</key>\n            <string>556aa9a6-04bb-4144-9a1b-e1b20cda3b46</string>\n            <key>PayloadVersion</key>\n            <integer>1</integer>\n            <key>ProhibitDisablement</key>\n            <false/>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n    <key>PayloadDescription</key>\n    <string>Adds the Google DNS to Big Sur and iOS 14 based systems</string>\n    <key>PayloadDisplayName</key>\n    <string>Google Encrypted DNS over HTTPS</string>\n    <key>PayloadIdentifier</key>\n    <string>com.paulmillr.apple-dns</string>\n    <key>PayloadRemovalDisallowed</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>PayloadType</key>\n    <string>Configuration</string>\n    <key>PayloadUUID</key>\n    <string>B27E8E10-697D-4938-8745-7FFEEEED57A0</string>\n    <key>PayloadVersion</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n", "Q: WhatsApp with Mac Catalina After upgrade in Mac OS 10.15, WhatsApp would not open due to security check failure.

That's my fault.)\n\nA: I used to have this issue in the past before, and for me the cause was faulty lightning cables. Make sure you're using genuine cables from Apple and not third-party ones. This might not be the same solution for you but try it out and I hope it helps!\n\nA: Personal Hotspot being \"on\" while connecting the USB (tethering) seems to be the issue. Turn it off, connect the cable and turn it back on if required.\nIf you just need to use the hotspot and not bother about syncing iPhone using iTunes/Finder, then enter passcode once, & tap \"cancel\" or \"Don't Trust\" second time onwards and you will not face any problems.\n\nA: NOTE: See the edit history if you're curious on updates / timing of this\nTo clean up from this - you may have to both update iOS / macOS and perform operations on /var/db/lockdown that are more complicated than removing a folder / file.\nOn to the story of how we learned this...\nI've been working with AppleCare on this issue for about 2-3 months now. The Apple engineers have confirmed to me that they can replicate the trust dialog box issue when the iPhone's Personal Hotspot is enabled, and connected to a Mac using Apple's official USB-A to Lighting cable. I believe that they replicated this using the same operating system as the one running on my MacBook Pro (macOS Mojave 10.14.6). So I'm not sure if it affects macOS Catalina, but I will be testing that shortly myself.\nThey are still investigating, but they said they're unlikely to patch up older operating systems. So I'll get back when I know more.\nSome things to note in my case:\n\n*\n\n*This is all happening with completely new and old Apple's official Lighting cables, but none of my cables have wear and tear, so unlikely to be a physical connection issue. Especially since they also can replicate it.\n\n\n*Resetting Privacy settings on the iPhone deletes the trust relationship with a computer, so after resetting this, it will prompt you to trust your computer next time it is connected via the Lighting cable.\n\n\n*Interesting to note, when it's prompting you to trust your computer for the first time, it will say:\n\n\"Your settings and data will be accessible from 'Name's MacBook Pro' when connected wirelessly or using a cable\".\n\nBut after trusting it and connecting it again with personal hotspot enabled, it will say:\n\n\"Your settings and data will be accessible from this computer when connected wirelessly or using a cable\".\n\n\n\n*Additionally, after the initial trust between the iPhone and the Mac, the Mac writes a plist file in the /var/db/lockdown/ folder, which is titled your iPhone's UDID.plist.\n\n\n*This plist file is used each time your iPhone and Mac are connected via the Lighting to USB connection, to check that the devices have trusted each other. If the plist is missing, the Mac will prompt you to trust it from your iPhone before iTunes will recognise it.\n\n\n*Deleting the iPhone's associated lockdown plist file on the Mac, has the same function as resetting your iPhone's privacy settings (but on the Mac-side).\n\n\n*It's a bit more difficult to delete it, requiring SIP to be disabled and entering into Rootless. So unless you are very confident in working in rootless, there's not much point, as resetting Privacy settings on the iPhone has the same function. After resetting iPhone's Privacy settings and trusting your Mac from your iPhone, the old plist file is overwritten by a new one in the Lockdown folder.\n\n\n*Finally, I've noticed that if the iPhone and Mac are connected via the Lighting cable, and I disable or enable Personal Hotspot on my iPhone, there is a very quick disconnection/reconnection between the devices. I notice this on iTunes and can see it in the Mac's console log event messages.\nThe only solution so far is to ensure Personal Hotspot is disabled in the Settings app. Note that disabling the Personal Hotspot in the iPhone's Control Centre is not enough, as that just sets the discoverability off. You need to go to the Personal Hotspot settings in the Settings app to fully disable the hotspot.\nAs I said, I am unsure what the cause is, but I will update here when the Apple Engineers get back to me. But I hope this provides you all some additional information.\nPlease note this is my first time posting on Ask Different stack exchange, so I hope this post meets all the community guidelines :)\nUPDATE 18 February 2020\nI've just had a call from AppleCare. The Engineers have confirmed this is a bug that can be replicated on macOS Catalina 10.15. The Engineers have now escalated this to their senior Engineers to develop a bug fix.\nAs this is now out of the hands of my AppleCare Mac Specialist, my case has been closed, so it's unlikely I will receive any further updates on this issue. However my AppleCare Mac Specialist said \"you've found a bug, and now we're going to fix it\", so hopefully they will do this.\nIf I do get any further updates, I will post here.\nUPDATE 18 September 2020\nI've updated my iPhone XS to iOS 14 yesterday, and after testing various different scenarios, the issue no longer appears to be happening with or without the hotspot activated. Note, I have only tested this on macOS Mojave 10.14.6, so I cannot guarantee it has been fixed for earlier macOS versions, but suspect it has been fixed for at least Catalina and Mojave.\nI will continue to monitor this just in case it does develop again.\nI'm glad that a longstanding bug has been finally fixed and hope that my reports to Apple had contributed to this being fixed. Now if only Apple could fix the usbd bug that causes connection issues between iPhones and Macs (mainly MacBooks) which I have described elsewhere on this forum...\nPlease let me know if you still experience this issue with iOS 14.\nHope this helps everyone!\n\nA: The following worked for me. This is from https://macreports.com/iphone-keeps-connecting-and-disconnecting-from-mac-fix/\nOn the Mac, open the terminal,\nsudo killall -STOP -c usbd\n\nOr use Activity Monitor to kill the process.\nThis will restart the USB daemon on Mac. After this, my phone asked for 'Trust' only once.\n\nA: Yes there are malware which mimic iOS window which origin isn’t clear, but all of these malware are either asking user an account and a password or providing a link to click (which link will connect the user to a booby trapped server).\nNo you weren’t facing a fake window in this case even if the origin of the window isn’t given. This window doesn’t try to steal you any private information.\nThis is just a poorly designed confirmation of trust window which should be named iTunes sync or something approaching. This is also probably an old bug when the connecting iPhone and Mac are well known friends.\nI found many log entry of my iPhone which are accessible in Settings > Privacy > Analitics. But I still have to find a tool to analyze them.\n\nA: I believe \"trust issues\" can be caused by flakey or failing cables. My eventual solution after all manner of troubleshooting was purchasing a new original cable.\n\nFor some explanation, I too have had this nagging issue for a couple of weeks now. After trying everything I finally tried a different (brand new) cable (both are original apple cables, but the old one I have used for many years and has signs of wear at the connector). With the new cable it stopped asking me to Trust. Plug the old cable in and I get the Trust question again. So the cable seems to be the issue; nothing else has seemed to work. (Mac is an old Mid 2012 Pro on Catalina 10.15.3 and the phone is an 8 with 13.3.1 iOS).\n\nA: For what it's worth, I have found that when the keypad appears, rather than entering the numbers, if I just hit cancel, the Mac is back in the good books, but it still happens every time.\nAnd for what it's worth again, on at least one occasion, I was not prompted to trust the Mac, but I am unable to replicate the exact circumstances again; programs running, settings, facing north, the colour of my socks etc. I sometimes connect via USB, and sometimes wi-fi. It never asks when connecting via Wi-Fi, only USB. And as I said previously, if I just hit cancel when prompted for the passcode . . . at least I don't have to do the button boogie.

Now I'm on 10.15 Beta (19A512f), which I think it is beta 4, I'm trying to restore a timemachine backup of mojave(10.14.5).\nMy question is do I have to erase my entire disk to go back to mojave. I somehow managed to erase once before on a different machine. When I entered recovery mode again right after erasing, it seems like it tried to download a large image for a bare machine only using internet, but the timer stuck at 24:00.

One is called Macintosh HD, the other is called Macintosh HD data. Both get similar info, I don't know which one it should be. So back to my question, do I have to erase entire disk. If I don't erase, which disk should be selected as restore destination.

And I also turned genius bar guys for help, they said Catalina bring security feature, they can't help me restore factory setting(install Mojave) either. Plus they said using beta version means you have to deal with issue yourself. Any solution other than these would help.\nThank you guys\n\nA: Unlike some installations of some operating systems there is no OS level uninstall feature in macOS.\n\n\n*\n\n*That is true for applications, though some do have uninstallers available. \n\n*That is true for minor OS version upgrades, EG 10.14.1 to 10.14.2 \n\n*That is especially true for full versions, EG 10.14 to 10.15\n\n\nWhat that means is that if you install an OS update or upgrade and you need to revert back to the previous version there is no built-in way to do so. \nIn fact the ONLY way to revert  any OS upgrade is to back up your files, boot into recovery mode (or a bootable USB installer), wipe the drive and re-install the operating system. Once that is done you can restore from your backup.\n", "Q: Android JPG images not opening in Photoshop I have problems opening JPG files sent by Android smartphones.

I have a campervan, and was wondering if I can charge my macbook pro late 2012 60W (A1425) with a homemade 24W usb-magsafe charger.  I am asking this question, because I am planning to build a charger that can charge using the cigarette lighter. \nIs it better to have a higher current / wattage capacity - 75W charger for safe operations of MacBook Pro?\n\nA: The rating is a maximum power value, and your MBP will draw only what it needs. Your MBP needs up to 60W in order to work at full power AND recharge the battery. Using a 24W charger will only charge the battery if the MBP is using less than 24W to run.\nHowever, because 24 is much less than 60, it's likely that this power source will be insufficient to power the MBP and recharge the battery. If the MBP is sleeping, you might charge the battery very slowly overnight. If in use, you might charge the battery very slowly, or even just make the battery discharge more slowly than normal. I've used 45W power supplies with 60W Macs and they have charged slowly while in use; but when the Mac works hard, the battery level falls, though slower than without the supply.\nI'm prepared to say that using a lower-wattage supply will not harm your battery. Whether the actual device you make is safe will depend on you.\n\nA: It is safe to use a lower power charger than the factory supplied charger but NOT safe to use a higher one. The biggest problem you may have is that your laptop may use more power than it is receiving even when on charge so you need to let it charge without use if using a significantly lower power charge like you will receive from your cigarette lighter. It may not even be enough power to charge when not in use.\nGood luck though.\n", "Q: Restoring from Time Machine to different type of Mac I have been using a Time Machine for back ups for about 2 years now. Recently, I got a new iMac 27in and ‘restored’ it from my MacBook Air backup (most updated OS). I chose all the options as seen below: \nI have noticed that my new iMac is running a bit sluggish, I am attributing this to the fact that it a Fusion Drive, but I am also being told that it could be because I copied over all the files (including Computer & Network Settings)\nIs it advisable to restore a Mac from a different Macs Time Machine? \n\nA: Actually that is, in most cases just fine.\nI've been restoring my user profile on an older Mac to a newer Mac since the Migration Assistant was available on OSX. And I always do what you just did, restore everything.\nThat said, if you were having issues with your networking on the old Mac then it might carry over to the new Mac. But I have never seen restoring the network settings to a new Mac cause the new Mac to misbehave in any way.\nThat said, just because I didn't have any problems doesn't mean it can't happen. You could go through your ~/library/Preferences and /Library/Preferences folders, delete any networking related files and reboot. That would likely tell you if that was the problem.\n\nA: The Fusion Drive is significantly slower than the SSD on a MacBook Air. There is a portion of SSD on the Fusion Drive, but after copying all of your files over from your old Mac, it will take the operating system quite a while to determine which are the files/programs you use the most in order to \"optimize\" (i.e. put on the SSD portion of the Fusion Drive).\nAfter you've been using the computer regularly for a week or two, it should speed up a little (assuming you are consistently using the same software). But it will never be as fast as a pure SSD like on your MacBook Air.\n", "Q: Finding out if upgrading to a newer macOS version will cause issues? I'm going to be upgrading my Macbook Pro (mid-2012 model) from its original OS X Lion 10.7 installation to a newer version of macOS. It looks like Apple will allow me to upgrade from Lion directly to OS X El Capitan 10.11 and macOS Sierra 10.12, and from there all the way to macOS Mojave 10.14.\nI have heard that upgrading to a newer OS can cause performance issues, especially on older hardware. How can I find out about these issues, so I can determine the best version of macOS to upgrade to?\n\nA: The biggest consideration is the software you run, not just in terms of compatibility with macOS generally, but also in terms of identifying if they're 32-bit or 64-bit apps (which will be a crucial consideration moving forward if macOS Catalina interests you, since it will be compatible with your MacBook Pro hardware).\nAs a starting point you can use the RoaringApps website to check software compatibility. You can search by specific application if you have key software you need to work with. You can also actually download a Roaring Apps app for macOS, but I've always found the Application Compatibility Table (see below) on their website to meet my needs.\nMy advice would be to check your software against the Application Compatibility Table for compatibility with El Capitan. If all good, then upgrade to that first and use the system for long enough to be satisfied everything is okay, and long enough to have a full working backup of your El Capitan setup.\nOnce you've done that, check the Application Compatibility Table again for compatibility with macOS Sierra etc before upgrading again.\nTo identify which applications you have installed are still 32-bit, you can follow one of the answers at: How can I find out which Mac apps are 32-bit?\n\nA: \nWhat should I look out for before I upgrade, and should I consider not upgrading to the newest version of macOS so I can keep certain applications running the same?\n\nUse the following reasoning to answer the above questions. At the simplest level, this is what you need to take care of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare a list of all the 3rd party apps that you use. Make sure that it includes, at the least, the apps that you are highly dependant on for your day to day personal/professional usage. You'll need to make sure if they are supported and run fine on macOS Mojave.\nMac OS X Lion and macOS Mojave are 7 years apart. With the pace of technological innovation, quite a few apps have broken/become unsupported in the newer releases of macOS.\n\n*Prepare a list of all the 1st party (Apple) apps as well. Especially list down the apps that you are highly dependant on for personal/professional usage. Apple too has deprecated/removed some of its apps. You need to make sure that upgrading to macOS Mojave doesn't leave you hanging without some apps that you are dependant on.\n\n*Apple announced a while ago that macOS will drop support for 32-bit only apps. While this was expected to happen with macOS Mojave, 32-bit apps still run, albeit with an error message that the app may stop working in the future version of macOS. (Such apps still work with the current and most likely the last public release of macOS Mojave, i.e. 10.14.6. This will change with macOS Catalina, the upgrade expected within a couple of months).\nUpdate: macOS Catalina is now released publicly. It doesn't support running 32-bit apps.\nCheck if any of the apps that you use (3rd party) that are still 32-bit only.\nCheck the release notes for or get in touch with the developers of the 3rd party apps you are concerned about to check their compatibility status with macOS Mojave. This will better prepare you with your upgrade plan.\n\nWould keeping a separate partition of macOS Lion be an alternative?\n\nYes. However, it would require some work with creating partitions and installing Mac OS X Lion and macOS Mojave side-by-side. This could be some work for a casual user.\nI'd recommend you to get an external USB hard drive and install macOS Mojave on it. You can boot off of the external drive (restart MacBook and hold Option key to select boot drive), while leaving your current installation of Mac OS X Lion intact. Work with this setup for a few days until you are convinced to fully commit to macOS Mojave.\nDo note that when running off an external hard drive, macOS Mojave may feel slow merely due to the fact that the OS is running off of an interface with slower speed. Don't let that make you assume that macOS Mojave is slow.\nThis is the best and the easiest strategy you can use to test things out and transition seamlessly.\n\nA: You don’t have to do any pre testing if you get an external USB drive and install any new OS you choose. As long as it’s newer than the one you run, you can then boot to the external, run migration assistant to copy over your apps and data and run any tests you like.\nIf it is faster, do the upgrade on your main disk and repeat. If not, you can spend whatever time you want sorting out the performance or skip that version and erase the external.\nWhy worry about general benchmarks when you can test the things you really care about and then upgrade when you are prepared and have data to back up your move?\n\nA: The problem in upgrading is largely one of compatibility with your existing application software. If you are running software designed for Lion (released in 2010), then jumping up to El Capitan (2015) or later may cause problems, as the software you've installed may be expecting things that aren't there or don't work in the same way. Make sure your apps and other software is compatible with the newer OSes, and you should be fine.\nWhile your hardware still falls into the range of newer OSes, they usually are geared towards faster, more capacious hardware, and so work better on systems with SSDs and lots of RAM.\nHowever, I had a 2012 MBP, and it worked perfectly fine on every OS I upgraded it to (albeit with an SSD in place of the original hard drive and 16 Gb of RAM). I also made sure that my software was broadly 'contemporary' with the OS. \n", "Q: Disable Photo Booth sounds How do I stop Photo Booth.app making sounds on the countdown and on the capture?\nSounds like a \"beep - beep - beep\" countdown and a shutter sound for capture.\nHow do I mute the app?\n\nA: Here's a possible option for you:\nHold down Option key while clicking the camera button. It'll instantly take the picture and not use the screen flash, but it will be silent.\n", "Q: USB-C dock with HDMI graphics on Late 2013 MacBook Pro I have two MacBook Pros, a 2017 model with Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a late 2013 Retina with TB2 and USB3 ports. I use a HP USB-C Dock G4 docking station for the 2017 model. I have two 1080p HP displays attached; one is through HDMI straight to the docking station and the other goes through the HDMI input on a DisplayLink USB 3 adapter and connects to a USB3 port on the dock.\nThis setup is super convenient for me with the 2017 MacBook Pro as I can charge the device, use both displays and a bunch of other USB peripherals all over a single cable. I'd like to have a similar setup for the 2013 model as well.\nWhen I connect it to the dock via a USB3 type A to type C cable, I get the DisplayLink monitor (which makes sense as it's a USB peripheral) and other USB devices, but not the direct HDMI monitor or charging. My understanding is that I probably won't be able to charge it through the dock since it uses a MagSafe connector, but I'm wondering if there's any adapter I can get to connect both monitors at the dock, without having to switch cables behind the dock?\nMy displays have 2 HDMI and 1 VGA inputs each. No DisplayPort on either of them. The dock has one HDMI (that I'm using) 2 DisplayPort plugs marked ++ but I don't know if they/re input/output/both/support daisy chaining etc or not.\nQuestion is: What kind of adapter/cable should I get to connect my 2013 MacBook Pro to this dock to get maximum functionality with minimal cable clutter? My first thought is to use an HDMI cable for the direct-to-dock display, a USB A to C cable for all other peripherals and the stock MagSafe 2 adapter for charging. But I'm wondering if there are any Thunderbolt 2 (mini DP style) to USB-C type adapters that would reduce the clutter from three to two cables?\nThanks for the answers..\n\nA: USB-C is a connector, not an interface.  So, on your 2017 MBP, the \"USB-C\" ports are actually Thunderbolt 3, which includes displayport over USB-C.  It is this video signal which is able to drive the monitor connected directly to the dock.\nOne option would be to get a TB2 dock (e.g. https://www.startech.com/Cards-Adapters/Laptop-docking-stations/thunderbolt-2-laptop-dock~TB2DOCK4K2DP).  They are pretty rare now that TB3 has taken over, and hence expensive.  You could potentially connect that dock either directly to the 2013 MBP, or to the 2017 MBP via a TB3->TB2 adaptor (I've not tested this, and I know the Apple adaptor is pretty fussy about what it will connect to, but it should be fine as the dock is true TB2 and not mini-DP).  The dock has two display outputs - these are DP, but can be converted to HDMI with further adaptors.  It's gonna be pricey, but would allow you to swap the setup between laptops pretty easily.\nIf it were me though, I would just keep the dock for the 2017.  Your 2013 has an HDMI port built in, and you can readily convert one of the TB2 ports to HDMI with an adaptor.  Your monitors can each handle 2 HDMI cables.  So you could connect both laptops at the same time, and just switch between them using the monitor input settings.  It's not as elegant, but it will be a lot cheaper.\n\nA: I would recommend getting TB3 enabled monitors, then daisy chain them, less cables and easier access. \"https://www.lacie.com/manuals/6big12bigtbolt3/daisy-chain-and-power-delivery/\"\nHere is an example of a monitor you can daisy chain with thunderbolt 2\nHere is an example of a monitor you can daisy chain with thunderbolt 3\nNow most of these monitors you'll find will be high end, but that that answers your question of reducing cabling and allowing you to connect multiple monitors.\nYou can use the thunderbolt 2 ports on your MacBook pro to connect 2 monitors using a thunderbolt 2 to hdmi cable. Then you can also connect another hdmi monitor via your hdmi port, but that might cap out your gpu allowance on your MacBook pro.\nAlso this also addresses your issue: How to use 3 external monitors on 15\" late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina?\n", "Q: Does iOS 13 (aka, iPadOS) provide better support for connecting a webcam to an iPad? Does iOS 13 (aka, iPadOS) provide better support for connecting a webcam to an iPad?\nIf it did, then an iPad would become an excellent device for supporting video conferencing, since using its USB-C connection you could then connect it to an in-room speakerphone, videocamera, ethernet, and power, and use the iPad's screen for displaying remote participants.\nMy understanding is that the only thing that stops this from working right now is that in iOS 12 the iPad does not natively support connecting to video cameras.\n\nA: There has been no mention of enabling video or audio streaming over the usb-c connector. The two features they are adding is to allow your iPad as a monitor for your mac, and now you can use a thumb drive or external drive via a usb-c and access the files via the file browser on iPadOS.\n\"Connect an external hard drive, SD card reader, and, yes, even a USB drive.\" https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/\nYou might be able to wire something up via homeKit. But you'd need to be doing wireless, and there may even be wireless solutions to this day. But they are no adding anything new for native wired audio/video over usb-c.\n", "Q: Gboard Keyboard Not Showing Up in Various Google Apps on iPhone Xr \n*\n\n*iPhone Xr \n\n*iOS 12.4\n\n*Gboard 2.2.0.247258495\n\n*Gmail 6.0.190602\n\n*Docs 1.2019.28202\n\n*Chat 0.156.259040960\n\n\nIssue:\nI various apps developed by Google, such as Gmail, Docs, Chrome, Chat, the Gboard keyboard is not appearing.

Only the default keyboard and emoji keyboards work in the google apps like gmail, hangout, meet etc. I can't find a lot of people complaining about the issue online so I figured it might be because this is a company device and some permission is blocking it? The custom keyboards work in all other apps so gboard not working with google apps is just baffling.\n\nA: The root cause of this issue ended up being related to a corporate MDM that's tied to the device. Luckily this app is approved by corporate. However, to resolve, I needed to uninstall the Gboard app I had downloaded from Apple's App Store. I then needed to re-install the app from my corporate's \"App Catalog.\" After taking these steps the Gboard keyboard appears in all apps as expected.\n", "Q: iOS 12.2 unknown words can be dragged around, but why? By accident I've discovered the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I open the messages app and write some text in the message area\n\n*I write a word that the phone doesn't have in its dictionary and it gets a red dotted underline\n\n*I tap on it and it gains a pink highlight and the black menu appears suggesting alternative words\n\n\nAt this point I can hold my finger on the red highlight and then drag the word around the screen. It appears in a white background rounded rectangle with a superimposed green plus, while the misspelled word in the message box is a grey color. The keyboard disappears. \n\nI haven't been able to figure out what else to do with it- dropping it on various parts of the screen doesn't seem to do anything. I did wonder if it added it to the dictionary but it seems like such a bizarre UI for doing this, and the next time I write the word it still suggested as a misspelling..\nWhat is this functionality for?\n\nA: When you click on the word like that it is selected.  You can drag the word around at that point.  If you select some text and drag it around you'll find that it does the same thing.  You'll have to select some bigger text so you can click the middle of it and not change the selection.\n\nA: It appears to be a way to copy text from one text field to another. In the messages app I noted that if I drag the text from the message area to the \"To\" box and wait a short while the plus mark on the dragging text will briefly disappear then reappear. If I let go the text after it has done this it will be added to the To box. I'm hence assuming that this is something like a quick copy paste functionality. It doesn't appear universally implemented; though (as per Thomas' answer/comment)  I can select text I'm editing (so it has a blue highlight) and drop it elsewhere it doesn't seem possible to select text off a webpage and drop it into a text box. I also note with the messages app if I drag text out o the message box, pause, then drop it on the conversion the text ends up pasted on the end of the message text box again, so there are perhaps some bugs where the focus target looks like it can receive text but if it's read only the text gets pasted into the next field on the page that can receive the text. The plus does disappear if the drop target is incapable of receiving text though \n", "Q: Locked file that I can't remove Long story short, I downloaded a file as a replacement for an app that no longer works on Catalina (macOS 10.15).

I've been updating an app that is created under a different Developers account and its becoming a real hassle accessing it - especially since Apple introduced 2Factor authentication. I have solved that issue but it's still a pain when notification emails go through a third party.\nSo what I want to do is create a new developer account myself. But I DO NOT want to link it up to my current personal Apple ID or account - I want to keep that separate.\nIs it possible to do this? Create a new apple developer account with a newly created Apple account with ID. Then I assume I need to add both to my iPhone so I can authenticate and gain access to the developer portal?\nDoes this sound right?\n\nA: Is the goal simply to have another account you can use to update the app in App Store Connect? If so, you do not need a developer account. All you need is for the owner of the developer account to invite you as a user and delegate access. Note that the invited account does not even have to be an Apple ID. This will grant you access to App Store Connect, but not all the resources of a full developer account. There are several roles and levels of permissions as detailed here: https://developer.apple.com/support/roles/\nIf you do need your own developer account, you must create the new Apple ID first, then enroll it in the developer program. You will have to sign into the new Apple ID from your iPhone initially to set a \"trusted device\" and enable two-factor (multiple Apple IDs can use the same trusted device). After you have set up your \"trusted phone number\" you can sign out from the new Apple ID and just use the SMS method for that account.\n", "Q: Prevent Time Machine From Resizing Disk Image? I've been trying to get Time Machine to stop filling up my NAS with backups, but so far it seems determined to do-so no matter what.\nSince Time Machine fails spectacularly with Linux disk quotas, using partitions isn't an option (even if my NAS let me, it's too late to set it up now), I decided to try resizing the disk image using hdiutil resize, which seems to be a common suggestion.\nThis did seem to work for a while, but as of today Time Machine has inexplicably decided that it knows better than me, and as such the first thing it does is immediately resize the image so that it will inevitably fill all free space on the drive.\nAs you can imagine this is infuriating, as I'm trying to backup multiple machines on my NAS, but it also runs a few services and other things as well, so I can't have it running out of space.\nIs there some way to limit the size of Time Machine's sparse bundle, such that it won't just immediately resize it again?\n\nA: There is a preference setting for that.

I like to play games on my iPhone but it is a real pain because of the battery drain so fast. Is there any kind of solution or app to reduce this draining?\nI've got an iPhone x and the operating system is ios 12\n\nA: No, there are no apps that generally lower power consumption on the iPhone.\nYou can enable power save mode in the Control Center to reduce power draw by background services, and you can uninstall or limit apps that use background services to stop doing that.\nHowever it sounds like you only have the large power draw when you're actually playing the game. In that case it is the game using the power, and there's really not much to do about it. You can check the game for settings that allow reduced power usage, or write a bug report / complaint to the game developers.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to x11vnc server from other client Hello guys I have installed x11vnc server on MAC OS el capital but trying to connect remotely and stream the images of desktop only a black image is rendered to vnc client do you have any idea?

This means that if you're running for example an X desktop in a window with emacs, xeyes, or whatever odd program - you can connect to that. \nYou cannot connect to a desktop running Finder, Safari, and similar. Those are not X programs and are not displayed on an X display. In order to connect to them, you'll need a macOS native VNC server. Such a server is bundled with macOS.

You will be prompted to Select a Wireless Network with the Apple Network abcdef as an option.  Touch it.\n\n*You should now be connected!  There is no need to actually perform the rest of the software update at this time.\n\n\nI think this works because - one, the software update tool really wants you to download (very large) iOS updates on Wi-Fi to save your data.  And two, the Airport extreme for some reason only works if you ask to join the network such that the network selector will pop up.

I see various older questions and replies about secondary axes and presumably can make them on my MacBook Pro. But I’m often working outside on my iPad these days and its lack of anything like traditional menu systems is quite maddening.  \nThe problem today is where the controls are hidden that will let me tell a plot to use a secondary y-axis for some of its series.  \nAnybody know? \n\nA: I did figure this out, sort of.  In some configuration, after you make the chart, there is an opportunity to select chart type and see a list.  You can select a two axis chart. Then you have to find your way to the menu that lets you edit the series and edit them one by one to have the axis you want.  \nI find this all very non-intuitive.

Several weeks ago, I noticed a swollen lithium-ion battery in an older MacBook laptop. Substantial swelling, the battery looks almost twice as thick as normal near one corner. I initially noticed the swelling because it deformed the bottom plate of the laptop. Since then, I have not used the device and currently am storing it in a fire safe location. Unfortunately, the battery is screwed in place inside the laptop and I initially worried that unscrewing might cause further damage or put pressure on the battery. Now, that it has been a while since I noticed the damage to the battery, I assume that it has discharged substantially (though the state of charge was unknown at the time of failure). \nIs this assumption safe to make? Can I expect that the danger of fire is lower after safely storing it for this period of time and not observing any changes? Do you think that there is still danger in unscrewing and removing the battery? How cautiously should I need to handle the battery?\n\nA: \nCan I expect that the danger of fire is lower after safely storing it\n  for this period of time and not observing any changes?\n\nNo. It may already be deeply discharged, or it may be 50% full. No way to tell from \"the state of charge was unknown\" and \"it has been a while\".\n\nDo you think that there is still danger in unscrewing and removing the\n  battery?\n\nNo. A battery is not nitroglycerin. Moving it without bending or pressing on it is safe. I'd say that it probably can be removed from the device without significant mechanical stress, so the 'risk' depends on how careful you are. You already know that you don't want to apply force to the battery in the process, but I believe you won't have to.\nI feel that the risk of letting it sit where it is is much higher than removing and securing it a.s.a.p. If it starts to burn right now, at least the MacBook will burn too, so get rid of the battery as soon as you can.\n", "Q: What's the best way to wind a MagSafe 2 around the clip and power brick to make it easier to transport? I'm totally blind, and have a MacBook with MagSafe 2 connected to the extension cable. Would somebody be able to explain how the cable can be wound around the clip on the MagSafe 2 and the pop-out wings on the power brick end to make it easier to transport in a bag? Lots of references that I've found on how this can be done are either videos or images which makes it harder to understand how this is done.\nThanks.\n\nA: I realize your post states you're completely blind, but I had to add pictures to make it absolutely clear to a sighted helper what I'm attempting to describe to you. My answer may also help others have a healthier relationship with their MagSafe charger cables.\nThe MagSafe cable, where it connects to the power brick, tends to get too severely bent with 'normal usage', even though there is additional strain- and bend-relief built into the cable, and the cable integrity can be compromised. When winding the MagSafe cable for transport, I tend to position the bend-relief section of the cable so it sticks straight out from the power brick, then proceed to wind the MagSafe cable firmly around the wings. When wound correctly, and the last 2 inches of the cable is free, I loop the the MagSafe cable around the winding, and the connector neatly sits protected, inside the windings, at the top of the power brick between a wing and the bend-relief:\n\nThe power cable is wound neatly and fastened using a single Velcro-brand \"One Wrap Thin Tie\". The power cable has a natural tendency to coil in a particular radius which is optimal for keeping the wrap neat. Follow that coil, place the tie-wrap in the right spot, and all is neat.\n\nI've been throwing this power supply in and out of my bag weekly for the past few years. I'm a little OCD, and I treat my equipment with care, so YMMV.\n\nA: I'll try to describe it as best as I can.\nThe thin MagSafe cable wraps around the fold out wings. On that cable you will feel a small plastic clip that slides along the cable. You want to slide this along the cable towards the MagSafe end of the cable, away from the power brick.\nYou will then hold the power brick in one hand and the thin cable in the other. Start wrapping it around the wings from there, sliding your hand along the cable as you go, keeping it fairly tight around the wings. When you get to the end, use the small plastic clip to fasten the cable to itself, securing it around the wings.\nNext is the extension cable, this won't wrap around the wings. So this is down to personal preference. I usually coil it in loops then twist the last foot or so within itself. But being blind this may be more difficult than necessary. Another option is to wrap the cable around the power brick, crossways over the already secured thin cable, and hold it in place with a rubber band or hair tie etc.\nIn the end, wrapping serves only two purposes:\n\n\n*\n\n*avoid entanglements with other items in the bag - you can mitigate that by putting your charger and cables inside their own small light bag and not worry.\n\n*avoiding a bend being always in the same place or a bend being tighter than the bend radius for the cables. As long as you don't crimp and pinch the cables, any smooth coil works well for longevity.\n\n\nA: Something like this is best, no need for extra accessories, although it can be much tidier than in this picture. \n\nEdit: Fair play I didn't read the question fully and missed the part about the OP being totally blind, apologies, an image isn't much use.\nI still think this solution might be better potentially than some of the other solutions so I'll have a go at describing it.\nThe aim is to wrap the thicker cable around the square power block in one direction and then the thinner wire around the square block  at a ninety degree angle using the pop-out wings. This allows the thinner wire to keep the thicker wire in place. \n\n\n*\n\n*Flip open the pop-out wings on the square charger block.\n\n*Of the two attached wires, find the thinner wire with the Magsafe connector. \n\n*Find the small plastic clip which slides up and down this thinner wire and push it to about 3cm or 1 inch from the Magsafe connector. We will use this later for clipping the wire.\n\n*From now on you should hold the square power block oriented with the pop-out wings on the side furthest away from you. The thinner wire can just hang down, just make sure it's not tangled with the thicker wire.\n\n*Now take the thicker wire and wrap it around the square block, starting from the side nearest to you and over the opposite side. The opposite side should have the pop-out wings and you are trying to wrap the wire evenly in between them. Don't worry if it isn't even though.\n\n*Once you have wrapped up the thick cable, you'll have to hold it in place with your hand (I find it best to use my weaker hand here). Try to keep your hand away from the top side where the pop-out wings are.\n\n*Now find the thinner wire and wrap it around the two pop-out wings. You should feel that you are surrounding the thicker wire as you do this and this is why I like this method. It keeps the thicker wire in place. \n\n*Once you have wrapped up all of the thinner wire, you should be able to attach the end to one of the loops you just made using the small clip we slid towards the Magsafe connector earlier  \n\n", "Q: How I can make sure my code is keep running? hey I am running an optimization model in AMPL.

It appears that the rm command operates just like on a Linux system, where it's irreversible. \nBut I did back up my Mac to my external HDD so I can restore it using Time Machine, but I wanted to see if anyone knows of another, preferably quicker way to get all of my files back in the directory I used the above command in?\n\nA: I used to make the same mistake frequently with rm -rf at my last job. One technique that I learned from another engineer was to, instead of navigating the the directory you want to empty, navigate to the parent directory, and use the command rm -rf directory-to-clear/* instead. This isn't foolproof either, but you're much less likely to make the same mistake. \n\nA: Copying from a backup is much more efficient than anything. If you want to take the hard route, stop using your operating system immediately and look into using testdisk on it from an external OS installation.\nFor backing up from your time machine drive do the following:\nPlug in your time machine backup, and then open up terminal.\nOpen up two finder windows. In one window, navigate to the deleted directory on your local hard drive. In the other finder window, navigate to the same directory (your backup copy) in the time machine hard drive. \nGo back to terminal and type:cp -R\nthen go to your time machine directory folder that is your backup copy, and drag it to the terminal. For example if you did rm -rf* ~/Downloads/ or rm -rf* /Users/Myhomefolder/Downloads/\nyour terminal should now look like this:\ncp -R /Volumes/TimeMachineHD/Datedfolderyouwanttorevertto/Users/Myhomefolder/Downloads\n\nthen enter /* and a space.\nNext drag go to the original deleted directory in your local drive using finder, and drag that folder to the terminal. \nyour terminal should now look like this:\ncp -R /Volumes/TimeMachineHD/Datedfolderyouwanttorevertto/Users/Myhomefolder/Downloads/* /Users/Myhomefoldername/Downloads\n\nthen press backspace to line your curser next to the last letter in the terminal, and type /. \nThe final command in your terminal should look like this:\ncp -R /Volumes/TimeMachineHD/Datedfolderyouwanttorevertto/Users/Myhomefolder/Downloads/* /Users/Myhomefoldername/Downloads/\n\nIf you originally deleted a protected folder in root, the be sure to enter sudo in the terminal before entering the command.\nBe sure you have the correct command and directories, then press enter to run the command. The back up will now copy to your hard drive.\n\nA: Restoring from backup is the way to go here, there is no magic „undo rm -rf“ command. \n\nA: You do not need to restore your whole machine.  You need to restore only one folder. Time machine is much faster than I assume.  Seems like a big deal to me since I've been trained never to relay on backup. \nJust crank up Time Machine and copy the folder, in which you deleted all the content, back to where ever you had it. I had to go back a level in TimeMachine's display before the restore button became active. \nOf course, you you could be missing the absolute latest changes. \n\nPick what folder you want to restore.  I picked my numbers folder. \n\nresult:\n\nPS:\n  I do not recommend deleting directories from the terminal.  It's safer from finder.  I've added the following aliases to my bash profile.\nalias cp='cp -i'\nalias mv='mv -i'\nalias rm='rm -i'\n\nRun these command and see how they go. When you delete all the files in a directory with the rm command, you will get asked to approve each file to be deleted. Once you have establish rm is deleting the correct files, use control + c to quit. Then repeat with a backslash \\ in front of the rm command to nix the alias version of the command and go to the plain rm command.  As a warning, aliases do not cross over to commands with  a proceeding sudo. Be careful.\nIn my account profile I've enhanced the cd command to print out the directory I cd'd into. This reduces slightly the risk of me getting confused over what directory I am in. \n# Print current directory after change directory command cd\nalias cd='cdir'\n\n# Define a command to change a directory and list the resulting directory\nfunction cdir ()\n\n{\n\n  \\cd \"$*\"\n  pwd\n\n}\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to download the iOS 13 public beta IPSW?

Those files are not executable on macOS (in general), and thus wouldn't work. \nHowever, if you copy the .exe file to a Windows computer, open it from Bootcamp on your computer or copy it to a virtual machine running Windows on your computer - then you could potentially execute it and get infected.\nNote that there is a (slight) risk that the .doc file you've received was specifically tailored for macOS. I haven't heard of such a variant of the W97M/Downloader, so it is probably not the case.\nI would advise removing the .doc and the .exe (and other files downloaded) - and then running a full virus scan. If you have backups of the machine, I would also advise comparing your current hard drive contents with the contents of the backup to detect any other alterations that might have been done.\nThe best advise regarding these types of malware that comes through email is simply to never open attachments in emails, unless you have verified that the email was sent by someone you know.\n\nA: There is no general answer to this. If it uses windows specific code, it will likely fail at some point without doing harm. However, it could still do harm within the possibillities of the scripting language. This is why you should never open files with embedded macros if you don't know they are save. In your current situation I don't think the Mac is really infected but would still run a scan with Malwarebytes to be sure. You can also configure Microsoft Office to never execute macros instead of asking the user. That should help if your friend always clicks before he thinks.\n\nA: Make sure everything is updated to the latest version, macos & Microsoft. If you want to co late with a backup, do so before all the updating. Next you turn on macos firewall in preferences and select the only signed applications options. If notice requests from the strange new files you can investigate it further and disable its access. Exploits and vulnerabilities for macos exist.. and almost always these things are documented and patched within the latest updates and malware scanners ect add them to their list. There are online resources tracking these exploits available, for ex. macos exploit DB\n", "Q: Apple Magic Keyboard on Windows 10 (fn key and layout) 1. How do you get the Apple Magic keyboard to work on Windows 10 with the fn key and the correct layout?\nI'm using a Magic Keyboard with British English layout but none of the fn functions work such as media keys, volume, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End, Del, etc.\nWhat I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using https://github.com/uxsoft/AppleWirelessKeyboard.  I can't get this to work on Windows 10 (even using the  5.1.5640 drivers).

If a phone is connected to another device through WiFi direct, will that connection prevent the phone from using cellular data?\nEdit:\nAn iPhone is connected to a dash cam using WiFi Direct (the dash cam shows as a WiFi network when turned on and the iPhone connects with the dash cam by joining the network and putting in the password).\nI've read somewhere that iOS can't connect to both WiFi and cellular data at the same time. I just wanted to know if using WiFi directs prevents an iOS device from utilizing cellular data.\n\nA: From experience and I hope design, Wi-Fi is prioritised above cellular when it comes to connection. Only Wi-Fi assist can be used to use cellular despite Wi-Fi. Also, battery discharge rate drops when on Wi-Fi even when cellular is ON, I believe it is not being used. I cannot provide references.  \nNow since dash cam is using Wi-Fi to stream video, not for internet, apps cannot detect the purpose. They'll treat it as logged-out network, or simply a disconnected from internet network. \n", "Q: Help with AppleScript to automate Numbers Cell Formatting I do several mundane repetitive tasks using Numbers App on a Mac, and wish I could just automate the same with the help of AppleScript. \nI got Numbers Spreadsheet with several tables, on the selected table, I want the script to run through all rows of selected column (which is column 1 mostly) and format cells (color the text blue or red) depending on even or odd value condition.\nthanks\n\nA: I finally got what I wanted.

Finally, is there any way in which I can automatically load key files to the openssh agent, and have these key files loaded the next time that I login as well? \n\nA: ssh-agent, the system builtin one, is run as a system daemon started by /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.openssh.ssh-agent.plist. Cause the service plist is located in /System/Library/LaunchAgents, it mean it's impossible to disable it unless you break SIP, which is not recommended.\nThe macOS version ssh-agent is built with additional KeyChain support compared with the standard one. The best solution is to use the keychain.\nFirst, uninstall the homebrew-installed SSH, brew uninstall openssh.\nSecondly, configure the SSH to use password from Keychain.\nHost *\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n# use the password stored in keychain\nUseKeychain yes\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nThirdly, add the key and password into Keychain.\nssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nIn this solution, we keep the password into Keychain and configure OpenSSH to load password for the key from Keychain.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenSSH updates in macOS 10.12.2\n", "Q: getting some information from activity monitor in mac pro I am running a code in Ampl I want to make sure my code is running still ,( I can not see it from software). in activity monitor the %cpu for this software is 99.6 . \nIs this mean the code is running?\nisn't it too much for cpu? 99.6?\n\nA: The CPU% value shows how much CPU load a process generates. A value of 100% means that the process uses one CPU core fully. As all modern Macs use multi-core CPUs you can even see processes with more than 100% CPU load sometimes (requires the process to be written in a way to make use of several cores at once of course).\nSo in your case the process is running happily. What Activity Monitor doesn't show you though is whether the process just runs in an endless loop or whether it actually processes its data as you expect.\n", "Q: How to disable tap to drag? On a MacBook air, the trackpad is super hard to use because whenever I try to move the cursor, it selects everything or drags something to somewhere random. This is the fault of some tap to drag feature. Whenever I touch the trackpad and move my finger, it thinks I am trying to click and drag. I disabled tap to click and everything, but this feature still vexes me. This feature is a pain in the butt so how can I disable it? \n\nA: If this is a newer MacBook Air (with a Force Touch trackpad), changing the pressure required to \"Click\" should help fix this. I experienced similar issues on my MacBook Pro.\nGo into System Preferences, click the Trackpad icon, and select the \"Point & Click\" tab. On the left you should see a \"Click\" slider with \"Light\", \"Medium\", and \"Firm\" options. If you shift it over one setting, you might find that's enough to fix the issue.\nAlternatively, disabling Force Click and haptic feedback (unchecking the checkbox at the bottom), may also stop peculiar behavior from happening.

Let's say, for example,  I want to execute some commands based on the Mac OS X Gatekeeper status of the system.\nExample: the following command line on your Mac OS X spctl --status will give you 2 possible output: assessments disabled or assessments enabled.\nCan I do something like that below?

What I want is to load this plist in different user accounts as I cant hardcode my user name.\nHow can I achieve this ultimate aim?\n\nA: You cannot use $HOME in these keys. You'll need to use the work-around shown in this answer:\nhow can I use $HOME, ~ or environment variable in plist file of LaunchDaemons\nAnd then use ordinary shell scripting to redirect standard out and standard error to locations within $HOME. I.e. use a command similar to:\ncommand >$HOME/launchd.stdout.log 2>$HOME/launchd.stderr.log\n\n\nA: You can't use $HOME in the plist but you can configure it easily enough.\nOnce the plist is loaded on the proper computer (lets assume it is at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/local.testing.plist for the sake of discussion)\nAll you need to do is enter two commands at the command line \ndefaults write \"$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/local.testing.plist\" \\\nStandardOutPath \"$HOME/launchd.stdout.log\"\n\ndefaults write \"$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/local.testing.plist\" \\\nStandardErrorPath \"$HOME/launchd.stderr.log\"\n\nThat will add the two log definitions with the full path, specific and correct for each computer.\nIt will also replace any existing values, so you don't need to worry about duplication.\n", "Q: How can I see which of my iPhone apps support Siri Shortcuts?

I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and a 10.5 inch iPad Pro 2017. Both are officially supported for the latest versions of macOS and iPadOS and support Sidecar.\nI installed the latest version of iPadOS and macOS and tried using Sidecar and it kinda works but it's extremely laggy and blurry and almost unusable and if I turn wifi off in my mac it disconnects and complains about wifi being turned off.\nAs far as I know this feature can work with wired connections as well and I tried connecting iPad to Macbook using a (Lightning -> USB A) to USB C adapter and also also tried using a USB 3 hub connected directly to the laptop using USB C and it still does not work.\nIs there any way I could force Sidecar to work over a wired connection?\n\nA: For me, it wasn't a cable issue and the \"Trust this Computer\" fix didn't work either. I finally found an answer on the Apple Support Communities that fixed the issue for me. Here's an excerpt of the relevant section:\n\nFollowing the instructions, I noticed there were two .plist files in particular that looked suspicious:\n/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration\npreferences.plist contained a reference to \"iPad USB\" (even though I didn't see iPad USB in my \"Network\" settings).\nNetworkInterfaces.plist contained multiple references to \"iPad\".\nI made a backup of the two .plist files, deleted them from the SystemConfiguration folder, and rebooted. Voila! Now Sidecar works over USB.\nNote: Both my Mac and iPad have WiFi completely turned off. Both have Bluetooth turned on. Mac is on Ethernet. iPad is connected to Mac using USB cable. That's it.\nI am not a Mac expert, so I can't advise on the two .plist files I deleted. It worked for me, but your mileage may vary, and I am not sure if there is any danger related to deleting these files. Another thing I am not sure of, is whether it was necessary to uninstall ExpressVPN AND delete the .plist files. I wonder if doing the latter is sufficient to get USB Sidecar to work.\n\n\nA: You can use a direct USB-C to Lightning cable (I used an MFi cable by Aukey). Turn off the iPad's wifi, make sure you are signed in to the same apple ID, have iOS13 and Catalina installed. It is much faster than the wifi connection for me (and I also have less lag on my mac this way).\n\nA: I struggled with the same problem and just now finally solved it. The issue was for me that I didn't earlier \"Trusted my iPad\" on my Mac, and \"Trusted my Mac\" on my iPad.\nHere's a how-to: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202778\nAfter doing this, it finally connects via cable and is hopefully less buggy.\n\nA: For anyone stuck with the same problem, I figured out that I needed to Trust the ipad on my Mac by opening a Finder window, click the ipad on the left bar and finally \"Trust\" with the appropriate button on the right.\n\nA: Using Catalina 10.15.6 and iPadOS 14.4.2, I've found that simply turning WiFi off from the control panel on the iPad (or toggling the slider in Settings) is not sufficient to force USB connection, you need to put the iPad into airplane mode — Mac was still able to connect to iPad with iPad's WiFi \"turned off\". It was only unable to connect in Airplane mode, and then plugging in directly restored connection. Testing in that way was the only way to ensure that it was using the wired connection.\n\nA: I turned on Airplane Mode on my iPad to use Sidecar and it works great!\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPad to iMac via USB-C (iPad Charge Cable)\n\n*Trust Device by going to finder and then your iPad\n\n*Turn on Airplane Mode on iPad\n\n*System Preferences on iMac and activate Sidecar\n\n\nA: I know you mention your model is 2016 Pro, but I wanted to post this here for anyone that ran into this article thinking these solutions may work for the 2015 Pro model....  they do not.  Sidecar DOES NOT work with the mid-2015 models (or earlier).\nI chased my tail on this for an hour when I realized it didn't matter that I bought my mid2015 model in 2016 [facepalm].    In my mind I made some assumption that it would work because a spotlight search in Catalina tells shows Sidecar is there installed/available...

I have sent to you system reports and Samples from the process.\nI am experiencing a very strange bug on Safari. If I leave a webpage that uses websockets heavily, then sleep the system and turn it on back after a couple of minutes, the tab page keeps the CPU at 99.9% all the time, burning down my battery and CPU (it reaches 100ºC). I need to open Activity monitor and kill the page every single day.\nThis is happening to two websites, firebase.com and g1.com.br.\n\nMy system is running MacOS 10.14.6 (18G84) and Safari 12.1.2 (14607.3.9).\nIt's a MBP 15' i7 2018 with 32Gb of RAM.\nI have already cleared the NVRAM and SMC and it didn't solve my problem. I think it's a bug from Safari itself.\nThank you, it's my first post here so let me know if you need more information.\n\nA: As troubleshooting steps, I'd try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Test with another browser to see what happens. If the problem isn't repeated then you're starting to isolate the issue, although I would then try a 3rd browser for good measure to see how it also behaves.\n\n*Boot into Safe Mode (see below) and test again with Safari\n\n\nBoot into Safe Mode \nFollow these steps to boot your MBP into Safe Mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac \n\n*Restart your Mac \n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. visit the sites again with Safari and try to replicate the problem) \n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal \n\n*Test again when booted normally \n\n\nLet me know how these steps went and we'll go from there. \n", "Q: Safari search/url bar resets on change I'm using the latest Safari but have noticed this in previous versions too.\nWhen I'm on some page, http://example.com/page/111\nAnd I'm trying to type and go to another page http://example.com/page/222\n(i.e. I go to the search bar and start typing 222 instead of 111) and then press enter, the page either changes to 222, or returns to 111 (in which case the URL in the search bar changes back to 111).\nIt's absolutely random from my point of view, but maybe I'm doing something wrong, or have a wrong setting?\n\nA: To me this sounds like Safari is just prompting you with a URL, either from your visited history or from popular web page URLs.\nAnd, as it's doing this, if you press enter it's reading that as you accepting its suggestion, in which case it populates the address bar with that URL and takes you to that page.\nHowever, on other occasions, you've typed enough of the URL for Safari to know you're entering something different, or you've typed the whole URL in which case pressing enter is telling Safari to visit the URL you've manually entered.\nIf this is the case, then it's not a bug, it's just that you need to get used to this behaviour. Evenso, I think we all get caught out sometimes, especially if we press enter at the wrong moment.\nYou can test for this by entering a URL slowly and watching the address bar  - you'll see that it's suggesting a full URL path beyond the cursor and this suggested path will change depending on what you type, but if you press enter at any point Safari will interpret that as you wanting to go to the suggested path.\n", "Q: Cannot `brew install` from a `bash` script I want to create a script to setup an environment on a Mac.

Inside that is a macOS Mojave 10.14.6 guest OS. \nI want that macOS guest to have its display resolution (size) grow when I stretch the VM window. I am used to this behavior as a feature in Parallels Desktop (competitor to Fusion).\nWhen I stretch the VM window, the contents are stretched and pixelated but the logical size of the guest display does not change. \nWhen I go to System Preferences > Displays > Display > Resolution > Scaled, I see no other options but 1024 x 768. \n\nMy Fusion preferences are set to the default, Resize the virtual machine and the window. The documentation says that should change the resolution of guest VM.\n\nThere are older Questions on this topic such as this one. But they seem outdated or unclear.\n\nA: Reinstall VMware Tools\nAs was often the case with the competitor Parallels you mentioned, when the screen resolution fails to adjust you may need to re-install their software that embeds within the guest OS to enhance integration with the host OS.\n\nFrom the main VMware Fusion app menu bar, choose Virtual Machine > Reinstall VMware Tools. \n\nThis mounts an installer app within the Finder of your guest OS.\n\nRun Install VMware Tools.app. After it completes, your guest macOS restarts. Then you should be able to redefine your virtual display resolution. Simply grab the corner of the VM window on the host Mac, and grow/shrink the VM window. The size within the guest macOS auto-resizes. \nYou cannot use the System Preferences > Display within the VM to re-size. Instead, use this stretch-the-VM-window maneuver. \n", "Q: What does this blue dot in the Dock in Mojave mean?

The example from your question could also be written as \ncd directory/containing/the/files\nfind . -type f -maxdepth 1 -iname '*s02*' -exec mv {} /path/to/target/directory/ \\;\n\nIt's worth to have a look at man find to see which other options are available.\n\nA: For example with bash. Given the files below\n$ ls -1\ntest1\ntest2\ntest3\n\n1) To avoid surprises let's take a look at the commands first\n$ for i in test*; do echo mv $i $i.ext; done\nmv test1 test1.ext\nmv test2 test2.ext\nmv test3 test3.ext\n\nand execute the commands if this is what we want\n$ for i in test*; do mv $i $i.ext; done\n$ ls -1\ntest1.ext\ntest2.ext\ntest3.ext\n\nFit the path to your needs.\n2) It is possible to use sed and xargs. Let's test it first\n$ ls -1 test* | sed 'p;s/test/test_/' | xargs -n2 printf \"%s %s\\n\"\ntest2 test_2\ntest1 test_1\ntest3 test_3\n\nand execute the commands if this is what we want\n$ ls -1 test* | sed 'p;s/test/test_/' | xargs -n2 mv\n$ ls -1\ntest_1\ntest_2\ntest_3\n\nSpaces in the filename\nThese scripts won't work as expected if the filenames include spaces. In Unix space is used as a separator. For example with the files\n$ ls -1\ntest 1\ntest 2\ntest 3\n\nit is clear that the commands below can't work as expected\n$ for i in test*; do echo mv $i $i.ext; done\nmv test 1 test 1.ext\nmv test 2 test 2.ext\nmv test 3 test 3.ext\n\nThe solution is to exclude the space from the list of separators\n$ IFS=\"`printf '\\n\\t'`\"\n\nand prepend it to the commands that should process the filenames with spaces. The command below\n$ IFS=\"`printf '\\n\\t'`\"; for i in test*; do mv $i $i.ext; done\n\nworks as expected\n$ ls -1\ntest 1.ext\ntest 2.ext\ntest 3.ext\n\nNext option is the quotation of the arguments\nfor i in test*; do mv \"$i\" \"$i.ext\"; done\n\nThis way it's possible to use the rich variety of Unix filters and avoid the limitation to the \"find ... -exec ... {}\" construct. For other limitations see the notes under the line.\nNotes on macOS\n1) Quoting from opengroup.org - Product Standard: Commands and Utilities V4\n\n1.4.21 sh\n  Question 31: Is the environment variable IFS ignored when the shell is invoked?\n  Response: Yes\n  Rationale: The specification allows the sh command ignore the setting of the IFS environment variable on invocation. The setting of this variable has been used to breach security on systems which use the shell to interpret a call to the system() and execvp() interfaces.\n  Reference: Technical Standard, Shell and Utilities, Issue 6, Chapter 4, Utilities, sh, ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, IFS.\n\n2) Quoting from developer.apple.com - Shell Input and Output\n\nYou can modify the behavior of the read command by modifying the shell variable IFS (short for internal field separators).

Replace such characters first. See How to remove special character. There are dozens of articles how to rename files with spaces and other characters that make troubles e.g. Filenames with spaces breaking for loop, find command.

After moving my computer, a Mac Pro 2013 running Sierra 10.12.6, (from one building to another, with a week or so spent in a garage), I found that it would not boot. The system drive was the internal SSD. While I was placing the computer in to a cabinet, the cylinder was unlocked and the computer dropped out and fell a few inches, and fell on to it's side. I have to assume this jostled something important enough to not boot.\nI would get the Apple logo, then the circle with a line through it, then, eventually, it booted in to a utility mode with a menu to restore from Time Machine, use Disk Utility, etc.\nAs I understand it, that's the \"Recovery Partition\".\nNow, I have no memory of ever creating, managing, or maintaining such a thing, but there it was.\nUsing the Disk Utility, I could not find the native SSD built in to the Mac Pro, but it saw my external SSDs, including my Time Machine drive.\nI repartitioned one of the SSDs in to a big enough slice, and restored from Time Machine in to that new partition, and the system came back up. \nSo, my question is where is the Recovery Partition? I have to assume it's not on the internal SSD -- hard to imagine that simply a partition of the SSD is unmountable, vs the entire card. Is it on my Time Machine drive? That's my guess, but I don't know how to make sure.\nAt some level, I don't care. \"It just worked\" and did it's job. But I would feel better knowing that it's not on the internal SSD. My hope is that I can pop that out and push it back and it'll just work, or, barring that, I can simply replace it and nothing more untoward has happened to the machine.

I would like to hardwire it.\nNow, there is a wiring closest with a bunch of poorly labeled cables within it, ostensibly matching to the various outlets throughout the building.\nUnfortunately, the Mac Pro is quite far from the wiring closet.\nI'm curious if there is a simple command I could use (some kind of net status command, or whatever), perhaps combined with grep, or something of the like, that will let me know when the Mac sees one of its interfaces light up.\nMuch like having one person at the breaker box watching a light, while the other person across the building vainly flips breakers trying to locate the one that controls the light, my hope was that I could plug the Mac Pro in to the wall, start up this command or script, and have someone watching the screen as I started plugging candidate cables in to the switch, hoping to find the right one easily versus having to run back and forth.\nI guess I could just put \"ping stackoverflow.com\" in to a repeating loop and have the person shout \"Eureka!\" when a ping gets through, but I was hoping for something a bit more base level that was detecting \"net tone\" for lack of better word, even before DHCP and the rest of the network plumbing got in place.\nCan I simply loop ifconfig in to an awk script to show me which, if any, of the en#: items become active? Currently, I have 8 (en1-8) listed (among other things). One of which is active (en2), which I assume is the Wi Fi.\nIs it crass to assume that once I get a cable plugged in that either en1 or en2 will light up depending on which port is plugged in?\nThese ports don't have a light on them do they? Honestly, I never checked. That would be acceptable as well.\n\nA: If they are watching the screen why not go to System Preferences -> Network and watch the connected indicator.  It will show connected when connected to a switch even before DHCP.\nThis is also where a cable tester comes in handy.  Even the cheesiest of testers will work for this.  Check these out:\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Klein-Tools-LAN-Explorer-Data-Cable-Tester-with-Remote-VDV526-100/309925931\nOr a simple tone tester...\nhttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Sperry-Lan-WireTracker-Tone-and-Probe-Wire-Tracer-ET64220/202520187\n\nA: What if you try to share you Mac pros Ethernet connection (w/DHCP) to your WiFi card. Connect with your phone, it should connect and say no internet connection. Run off to the closet, plug something in then check your phone? \nYou could even set up ssh and log into your computer from your phone over WiFi and run ifconfig, ping, ect. \n\nA: MacOS includes an application called Network Utility located at /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/. In the Info tab you can choose the network interface you want to check and on the right you will see transfer statistics. The package count will add up as the interface is active and it will stay on the screen if the interface is disconnected.\n\n", "Q: \"Apple Watch Only\" apps not showing on Apple Watch when using Configuration Profile on linked iPhone The Breathe, Heart, Stocks, Walkie-Talkie, and Workout apps are not showing up on my Apple Watch. \nI know this is because I have a configuration profile on my iPhone with an app whitelist only configuration. When the profile is removed, the apps appear on the watch. This is done through inputing the app bundle ID.

I cannot find any app bundle IDs for any of the listed above Apple Watch apps.\nI have done lots of troubleshooting and have not come to any conclusions. \nCan anyone offer me some suggestions on how I can resolve this?\n\nA: I was not able to find the app bundle IDs for the apps I mentioned in the question. Without the app bundle IDs you cannot add the apps to the whitelist. My solution to this issue was to enable blacklist mode for apps instead. This caused the missing apps to appear.

The Mac won't boot and stalls during the reboot phase. Obviously I don't have a recovery partition with Snow Leopard.\nMy query is twofold. First can I just put the disk in the dvd drive and try rebooting from the disk. Second, will I lose data and apps? If so appreciate guidance on how.\n\nA: To boot from the DVD:\n\nPress and hold the C key on your keyboard immediately upon hearing the startup chime. Your Mac should start up from the OS X installer CD/DVD media.\n  (source)\n\n\nA: By default, installing a newer OS on an existing volume does not over-write user data. \nHowever, it's possible that your (elderly) Mac won't boot because the hard drive is failing, rather than because the OS is no longer functional. 'Hard work' for the disk like installing several GB of data may finish it off. It's worth doing a check of the disk with Disk Utility when booted from the installer DVD.\nAs said in the comments, make sure you have a backup before proceeding.\n", "Q: Protecting a user home folder using chmod and umask I want to create a standard (non-administrator) user on my Mac, and ensure that they cannot access my files. \nDoes the following make sense, and will there be any adverse consequences?\nsudo launchctl config user umask 077 (when creating new files and folders, ensure group and others can't see them)\nchmod -R go-rwx ~ (for existing files and folders in my home folder: remove read, write and execute permissions for group and others)\nIn particular, I'm worried about:\n\n\n*\n\n*Messing up any extended permissions\n\n*Whether it's OK to alter permissions on my ~/Library and ~/Applications and ~/Applications (Parallels) and ~/tmp folders\n\n*Is there anything outside of my home folder I need to think about protecting?\n\n\nIs there anything I'm missing, before I try this and potentially brick my system?\nI'm actually shocked that what I've described above is not the default configuration for MacOS, as it would prevent different users from seeing each others' files.\n\nA: macOS by default sets the permission on the standard directories (Documents, Pictures, Music, Library etc) to 0700. If this somehow got changed you can easily run\nchmod 0700 ~/{Documents,Pictures,Music,Library,Downloads,Movies}\n\nto fix it. And of course you can use the same command to change the access rights for other directories as needed.\nTo also protect any dot files etc you can also run\n chmod 0700 ~.\n\nIn any case you don't need to specially treat subfolders if the parent folder is already protected.\n", "Q: How to use `tmutil compare snapshot_path`? man tmutil shows\ncompare [-@acdefglmnstuEUX] [-D depth] [-I name] [snapshot_path | path1 path2]\n\n\nIf a snapshot path is provided as the sole argument, \ntmutil will compare the computer to the specified snapshot.\n\nDoes the 'snapshot' mean the result of tmutil listlocalsnapshots / (APFS snapshot)?\nI tried several ways but I could not make it work.\n\nA: From man tmutil: \nsnapshot\n  A directory inside a machine directory that represents a single initial or\n  incremental backup of one computer.

I have a 49\" 5120x1440 ultrawide monitor with some windows always open on the sides and I don't want any kind of item hidden behind them (for example, mounted external drive, downloaded/copied file, etc...)\nThe worst case is when I save or move something to the Desktop and I waste a lot of time trying to understand why I can't see the file – because it's hidden, say, behind my music player window.\nRight now I've badly solved the issue with a very inelegant solution, which is filling those areas with empty files so that nothing goes over there, the problem is that those then show up on Finder and it gets kind of annoying when I have to work with files on the Desktop\nSo, right now, there are two acceptable solutions for this:\nFind a way to tell macOS not to put icons on a certain area of the screen\nOR\nFind a way to tell Finder to not show, say, files with zero byte dimension or with a file name starting with \"empty\" or whatever filter we can apply.\nEDIT: this would not work as there is no way to tell Finder to show a certain type of file on the Desktop but not in a Finder window. Disregard this option.\nHere's a picture to better show you the problem and how I've partially (ie: badly) solved it for now:\n\nThanks!\nEDIT: I believe that I need to make a point about the answers given so far (which are ALL very appreciated, by the way): All the answers have been addressing my own bad solution instead of addressing the original problem which is clearly explained in the title: \"How to prevent macOS from putting icons on some areas of the desktop?\"\nThis is the ultimate goal: I want to tell macOS \"whenever I put something on the Desktop, DO NOT PUT IT INTO THOSE AREAS.\nMy solution was to fill those areas with empty documents, but it's ugly, not on the desktop, because those icons are hidden by the windows, but on a Finder window because it's filled with trash.\nHopefully this clears it up a bit!\nEDIT 2: this is how it looks normally, those windows are ALWAYS there, so it doesn't matter that there are all those files behind them, but when I open a Finder window, they'll all be there. Hoping this helps it up more.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/8mYPw8w.jpg\n\nA: @Luca: the same thing was driving me crazy, too (plus, my light O.C.D. doesn't help)! I have a 5K 49\" ultra-wide screen (exact same resolution as you) with my macOS Calendar app on the left 1/4 and my macOS Mail app on the right 1/4, with my main window (be it a browser, Word, Photoshop, etc.) in the middle 2/4. Default download/save folder for everything I do is my Desktop. So to get to new files, I always had to open Finder or minimize the Mail app. Just too many clicks!\nWhat I did was to get an app called \"Moom\". It's free and free of spyware/malware. In Moom, I then set up three screen zones on a 12x12 grid which I can easily switch in between using keyboard shortcuts. For the right 1/4 screen zone (where my Mail app is), I basically trimmed off just the upper-most three tiles which leaves just enough space for one row of desktop icons, including whatever last file I downloaded/saved.\nThis allows me to use 141 out of 144 tiles of my screen and only use 3 tiles (~2 % of my screen real estate) to show Desktop items at all times.\nHope this helps!\nUpdate: it's no longer free apparently, but costs $10. Still, worth the money for me.\n\n\nA: What about creating a smart folder “Desktop” and put it onto your sidebar. Try omitting parameters like show only files larger than 1kb. If you go to more options/show more from the query menu in finder... you can add a ton of parameters including “raw” query. Raw can be used to make some really complicated and effective searches. I think you can even extract the raw query from a saved smart folder. \n\nA: Not sure I really understand the goal here, so this solution may not work for you (this may still work for someone else). Not sure why you want to see all those icons but ... don't want to see all those icons. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Yeah. I prolly got that part wrong.\nSave them in a folder. It doesn't matter much what you call this folder or where you place it. Drag it into both the dock on the right side and into the side-bar.\nWhen saving/moving/pasting, use the sidebar to quickly change the location to the special folder. When accessing the files use the dock. Use the folder view 'List' in the dock if shorter than the height of you screen or grid if list is too long; but I would avoid stacks in the Dock.\nTo avoid using the Dock, use a service script that opens the folder in Finder and attach a keyboard shortcut to it. One keystroke and you have easy access but no windows throwing shade on your icons. You can also have the service change the Finder-window view on open.\nLook at stacks (not Dock stacks, but the new Desktop stacks). I have not explored this (all Desktop functions disabled on my rig) but it basically does some of the organizing for you. One click to access and one click to open ... I think. Worth a quick look and a try anyway. Only one place to go look for the files, if the rules for stacking meet your needs.\nOh, and finally ('bout time, right?), explore Smart Folders since specifying rules like file type, file size, name includes, and actual location (and so much more) are what Smart Folders are for. I think you can add one to your Desktop that finds all the files that meet your criteria; but save the files somewhere else, including maybe where they will ultimately be saved when the current project is closing. Then nothing to move off the Desktop when done with the files. Next project: change the criteria.\n\n[Whew] SSL\nEdit:\nOne of the answers to a similar question contains a script that might meet your needs. There are variables in the script called theGuttersX and theGuttersXFactor that might allow you to add extra space on either side of the screen. Not sure what those two were intended to do, but 'gutter' sounds like the right kind of intention ... But even if that's not the case, the script is a good starting point for getting the desired effect.\n\nA: Well we know that the icon placement is based on at least: \n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop size (system preferences)\n\n*Grid Size (finder preferences) \n\n*Icon Size (finder preferences)\n\n*Current desktop configuration (user cache) \n\n\nA: If you add a period the beginning of the empty file names, they will become a hidden file. Then can be viewed again by pressing cmd+alt+opt+period. However if you work often while showing “hidden files” there is a step further you can hide them by flagging the items as hidden. You can do so in terminal...\nchflags hidden /path/to/file\n\nIn your case you may do something like this~ \nchflags hidden ~/Desktop/empty*\n\nYou can use chflags nohidden to return the file.   \n", "Q: Cycle application windows changed in recent update (2019) I am used to pressing CMD+ ` on my mac to cycle through windows of the same application.\nIn recent updates, I am not sure if this was when updating to Mojave, maybe later, maybe before, this behavoiur changed.\nI have 3 windows of an IDE (PhpStorm) and I used to be able to cycle reliably and predictably through them, similar to how you cycle between apps with CMD+TAB, but this behaviour is now very broken (or I don't understand it anymore)\nIt seems to choose a random window every time I press the combination instead of simply going the previously opened window.\nHas anybody else noticed this? Can someone explain to me what is the logic behind? so I can wrap my brain around it and perhaps be agile again :p\nps. I mentioned my IDE because IDEs tend to overwrite OS shortcuts, so I am only about 90% sure it is macOs's fault, but it could be the IDE's fault.\n\nA: I use PhpStorm 2019.2 on macOS 10.14.6 Mojave. The behavior/logic for CMD + ` is not any different from how it has been in any relatively recent version of macOS or PhpStorm.\nPressing CMD + ` switches to the most recently used window, unless you haven't done anything in the currently active window, in which case it switches to the next most recently opened window (and this pattern continues for however many windows you have open).\nFor example, let's say you have a file open in PhpStorm in window A, then open another file in window B, and finally a third file in window C. If you're working in window C and then press CMD + `, you'll be switched to window B. If you press CMD + ` again before doing anything else, you'll be switched to window A. However, if, instead, you work on the file in window B first, then when you press CMD + `, you'll be switched back to window C (the most recently open window). In order to reach window A, you must press CMD + ` twice without doing anything in the window that comes up after the first window switch.\n", "Q: Why does macOS Preview show different sizes before/after resize? An image saved locally on my MacBook Pro (macOS Mojave 10.14.3) has a size of 4.4 MB, as you can see in the screenshot below:\n\n4.4 MB is the original size of the image, which has a resolution of 6000x4000.

With JPEG images, the content of the image affects the file size because image complexity impacts the ability for the algorithm to compress the file. What you see before completing the resize is Preview's best estimate.\n\nA: In addition tp @samh correct answer, when you save a jpeg in preview you get a slider to set the quality. Underneath the slider is the file size. You can see how the size varies with quality. I don't know what determines the quality but it  effects the file size.\n", "Q: Problems with network connection after switching USB LAN hub (despite using wifi connection) I have a 2018 MBP running 10.14.x\nI had it connected to a thunderbolt / USB-C to ethernet hub, this model.

When working or relaxing I like to keep my watch on Do Not Disturb, but I'd like to still get buzzed when it's time to stand. Is there a way to selectively enable a notification through DND?\n\nA: With Focus introduced in iOS 15, you can receive Stand Reminders by adding Fitness to the allowed apps in Focus settings. Apparently the notification settings of Activity app on the Apple Watch are mirrored from settings of Fitness app on the iPhone.\nThis is not a perfect solution as you can receive other Activity notifications such as Goal Completions and Activity Sharing Notifications if enabled. But at least it allows you to receive Stand Reminders while muting notifications from other apps.\n\nA: After a year I finally decided to create a shortcut for this: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dbb24facde0444a5a2ee0d9c724b5dd1\nThe loop should be customized to one's own schedule for sleeping. The prints are there to just debug the script. One should also make an automation for the beginning time f.ex. daily.\nIn a nutshell the shortcut disables Do Not Disturb for 10 seconds around the xx:50 phase. This allows the stand reminder to pass through notifications correctly. One could argue this is not an intuitive approach as there could be notifications passed through during that 10 seconds. Then again perhaps we should all embrace the user to manage their phone and notifications so that a push notification is not send from software x every 10 seconds or so.\n", "Q: How to remove the sidebar in Apple Preview (presentation mode)?

Is downgrade possible? Googled it a lot, seems it is not possible.\n\nA: I acknowledge this answer is based on a very literal interpretation of your question, but just to be thorough and in case it is useful to others looking for answers, here goes.\nYou could do this with a PC instead of a Mac, so long as you have past backups of the app in question on your PC or external backup drive.\nTo do this you need to download and install iTunes 12.6.3 (this can be installed alongside newer versions of iTunes). You would then need to copy the backup version of the iPad app that will work with your iPad to your iTunes Library. Then select and sync that version to your iPad from within iTunes.\nRefer to Deploy apps in a business environment with iTunes on Apple's website for further information and download links.\n", "Q: How to remove \"Disabled Software\" from MacOS System Report when a provided uninstall tool does not work? Is there a way to manually remove an item from the Disabled Software list or mark it as enabled when the version and date disabled are both listed as unknown? \nThe example below describes a situation where this happened. I am looking for a general approach to removing \"Disabled Software\" from the macOS System Report when a provided uninstall tool does not work. While this example references DisplayLink Driver, my goal is to solve this problem when other drivers produce this problem too. \nFor those who work for or with DisplayLink and have suggested DisplayLink-specific approaches (i.e. manually delete specific files and use the uninstall tool), I appreciate your suggestions. However, the provided solutions did not work for this scenario. I have also tried manually installing the driver using kext commands without success. \n\n\nA: The safest way is to use our uninstaller. If you have partially uninstalled you'll have to run a complete installation before uninstalling.\nThe uninstaller is in the /Applications/DisplayLink folder.\nDepending on your upgrade history you may have slightly different files but if you really want to uninstall manually -again not recommending that- here is the list of files:\nOSX 10.10.x:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Extensions/DisplayLinkDriver.kext\n\n*/Library/Extensions/DisplayLinkEthernetDriver.kext\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/com.displaylink.useragent.plist\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents/com.displaylink.useragent-prelogin.plist\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.displaylink.launchd.plist\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.displaylink.displaylinkmanager.plist\n\n*/Applications/DisplayLink/DisplayLink Software Uninstaller.app\n\n*/Library/Application Support/DisplayLink\n\n*/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/DisplayLink\n\n*/var/db/receipts/com.displaylink*\n\n\nAdministrator access is required.\nOn 10.8 the kext files are in /System/Library:\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/Extensions/DisplayLinkDriver.kext\n\n*/System/Library/Extensions/DisplayLinkEthernetDriver.kext\n\n\nFrom:  https://www.displaylink.org/forum/showthread.php?p=76864\n\nA: I have managed to get it working again. Here are the steps I had to go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uninstall the DisplayLink drivers and restart the system.\n\n*Right after restarting the system, reinstall the drivers. Don't restart again yet.\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Security and Privacy. If you did that right after reinstalling the drivers, you should see a message saying that an extension was blocked. You should know what to do now.\n\n\nThe message on step 3 only was displayed to me immediately after starting the system.\n", "Q: Fonts Choices Can Not be seen at Night The font choice are on the right side of the screen on Pages.

This just started happening on my Macbook 2016 .\nI removed the Night Shift Display but the font choices did not become visible. I have not changed anything on my computer. \nHow can I have it visible? \n\nA: I'm assuming your Mac is running macOS Sierra or later and your Mac has Night Shift enabled (by default Night Shift will change the appearance of your screen at night).\nTo access Night Shift settings go to Apple > System Preferences > Displays and select the Night Shift tab (see screenshot below): \n\nDepending on your version of macOS your Displays preference pane may look slightly different to the image above.\nNow you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Totally disable Night Shift by selecting \"Off\" from the Schedule drop-down menu\n\n*Experiment with the Color Temperature slider (at night with Pages open) to see if you can get it so that your font choices are easier to read.\n\n\nNOTE: You shouldn't have to reboot for the changes to take effect, but if they don't when you're expecting them to (e.g. you set a schedule from 7pm and nothing changes even though it's already after 7pm), you may need to reboot for the change to take effect.\n", "Q: Catalina Beta 5: Quicktime Audio Recording Not Working on 2018 Macbook Pros Starting a Quicktime Audio recording with Catalina Dev Beta 5 on 2018 or later Macbook Pros outputs files with no sound (Macbook Pro Microhone selected).

However the Partition button in Disk Utilities is always grayed out for the T5 disk. It is not grayed out if I select the Machintosh HD. What do I need to do to partition the T5? (I am running newest MacOS).\n\n\nA: You cannot partition a volume. You must partition a drive (device). To do so, click on the drive itself, located just above the partition you selected on the sidebar (\"Samsung Portable...\").\nThen, you can partition the disk.\nEdit: Back all data you want to keep up and Erase the disk as GPT (GUID Partition Table).

I assumed this would be straightforward, however, when I download a new pdf, it defaults to Preview because if I try to set Adobe DC as default I get the following message \n\nsomething.pdf can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App Store and identified developers.\n\nThen I have to go to security preferences and explicitly approve Adobe Reader. This is incredibly annoying because Preview doesn't support tabs and I tend to have several pdfs open at any given time and don't want to open each in a separate window.\nIs there a way to change the security preferences such that all opening all pdfs with Adobe reader is allowed by default?\nI'm on MacOS Mojave.\n\nA: Select a pdf file in Finder and click the Command-I keys to display the Get Info panel.

It seems to indicate I can drag and drop, but this isn't working. \nIf I add an image pane all I get is a text address not the actual gif image - where am I going wrong?\n\nA: Kevin is right. Not sure why Keynote wants to copy a link to media on drag from websites. Something to do with copyrights and attribution, I'm guessing. I'm not sure of your skill level, so I will try to be detailed (which may help someone else, as well).\nRight-click (or control-click) the image you want. Choose 'Save image as...' and change the name of the image before saving. It appears the images on the site are named dynamically 'giphy.' Then, in Keynote, use the Media button to select 'Choose.' Navigate to the image and [insert].\nUnless you want a big play button on the gif (or if the gif is not animated), you likely need to change the image's behavior in Keynote. Make sure the image is selected (if not, click it once) and on the right side you should see a few options. Click Movie and deselect the last option: 'Start movie on click.'\n\nA: When I open a new keynote file and then go to the media pulldown on the top of the keynote window, iI select the Image Gallery item. That inserts the following in my slide.\n\nThe black circle on the bottom right opens a finder like window to select your gif.

The iMac is running 12.14.6, and I'm located in the US.\nA little searching indicates I might enable Prebake to suppress these warnings. The Prebake page contains a link to add Prebake's filter list to the Safari filter list, but Safari won't load the linked page, not surprising given the link's formatting.

I've read that sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper;sudo dscacheutil -flushcache should flush the DNS cache on OSX (macOS Mojave).\nHowever, this command kills processes without restarting them, and is both hard to remember and cumbersome. Also, AFAIK dscacheutil applies only to the directory service.\nDoesn't OSX provide a command like Windows' ipconfig /flushdns to flush the system's DNS cache?\n\nA: mDNSResponder is started by launchd whenever a DNS query is performed in the system. So it will restart the next time some process performs a DNS query.\nKilling this process is not required though, sending the HUP signal with\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\nalready flushes the cache. This hasn't change up to 10.15.\ndscacheutil is only for 10.6 and you need a different command from 10.10.0 to 10.10.3, that's because Apple wanted to replace mDNSResponder with 10.10, yet the replacement had so many problems that they reverted back in 10.10.4 and stayed with  mDNSResponder ever since.\n\nA: I don't know of a shortcut but you could easily put the one-liner\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder;sudo killall mDNSResponderHelper;sudo dscacheutil -flushcache\n\nin a text file, name it DNSflush.sh for example, and use that as your command.

I also tried opening the iCloud folder on my computer and clicking the little cloud with the down arrow but it takes super long and hangs up my internet so I can't do anything else with it for hours.\nThe only way I could find to do this is to download the document files without the folders meaning I would essentially need to re-create the folder layout on my external, download the document files and then move them to the external drive which would be a pain and really slow.\nDoes anyone know of a way to do this a faster way? Or a way to back up iCloud so I can get to the files that way?\n\nA: You should turn off Optimise iCloud storage in System Preferences-> iCloud -> iCloud Drive options, before you try to copy files as per the other answer. Since you have a lot of storage(paid version), trying to copy partially downloaded files can be a mess. \nOther way can be to use https://privacy.apple.com. It lets you download selected information associated with your account. I don't know which would be faster. I suggest doing both. \n\nA: You could use the finder and open two windows. Then go to iCloud, select the files you want to copy and drag them to the external drive. \nThen once they are all copied over, select them again and deleted them.\n\nA: If you have an iPhone of iPad, you can simply go to FILES look for the folder.

After looking through several threads, plus lots of experimentation, it feels like something simple is wrong. The threads I read include \nHow can I trigger a Notification Center notification from an AppleScript or shell script?\nand\nHow to get a notification when my commands are done \nThis script is intended for minimally technical users to perform mounting and un-mounting shares. Right now it only supports SMB, but will handle NFS and other remote mounts later. We have the constraint that the user's system will be the base OS X installation, therefore we cannot install other tools or libraries.\nThe problem is popping a notification window when an event occurs, with text that includes a space in the argument passed to the function. If the argument is only alpha/numeric, it works fine.\nAs a starting point, I am using a piece of code from randomor on How to get a notification when my commands are done.

Use the Standard Additions scripting addition’s display notification command to show notifications, such as status updates as files are processed. \nTo show a notification, provide the display notification command with a string to display. Optionally, provide values for the with title, subtitle, and sound name parameters to provide additional information and an audible alert when the notification appears, as shown in Listing 24-1 and Listing 24-2.\nAPPLESCRIPT\nOpen in Script Editor\nListing 24-1AppleScript: Displaying a notification\ndisplay notification \"All graphics have been converted.\" with title \"My Graphic Processing Script\" subtitle \"Processing is complete.\" sound name \"Frog\"\n\nJAVASCRIPT\nOpen in Script Editor\nListing 24-2JavaScript: Displaying a notification\nvar app = Application.currentApplication()\n\napp.includeStandardAdditions = true\n\napp.displayNotification(\"All graphics have been converted.\", {\n    withTitle: \"My Graphic Processing Script\",\n    subtitle: \"Processing is complete.\",\n    soundName: \"Frog\"\n})\n\nNOTE\nAfter using a script to display a notification, the script or Script Editor (if the script is run from within Script Editor) is added to the list of notifying apps in System Preferences > Notifications. There, you can configure options, such as whether to display notifications as alerts or banners.\nClicking the Show button in an alert-style notification opens the app that displayed the notification. For a script app, the action of opening the app again triggers the run handler of the script, potentially causing the script to begin processing a second time. Keep this in mind, and add code to your script to handle this scenario, if appropriate.\nFrom:  https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/DisplayNotifications.html\n\nA: As Thomas Nelson pointed out, I had made this way too complex.

I was wondering where the default .pkg image file is that looks like:\n\nThis is not located at \nsystem/library/coreservices/CoreTypes.bundle/resources\n\nSame goes for .dmg files. Unless I have to go and download a .pkg/.dmg file and then \"Get Info\" and copy the icon in the upper right; which is the method I used to get the image earlier. Is it locally exclusive to .pkg files only? (meaning that apple makes an application where every pkg is set to default to have that)\n\nA: Images for most document types are provided by the application associated with that document type. For example, if you have TextEdit set as the default application for opening .txt files, the Finder will use an icon from TextEdit.app/Contents/Resources for those files (the exact icon file is controlled by TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist). But if you switch the default application to, say, BBEdit, then it'll switch to using the icon from BBEdit.app/Contents/Resources.\nInstaller packages and disk images work this way, so their icons are /System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app/Contents/Resources/package.icns and /System/Library/CoreServices/DiskImageMounter.app/Contents/Resources/diskcopy-doc.icns respectively.\n", "Q: macOS Mojave -- Finder won't show favorites and can't drag new folders into favorites Something happened to Finder on my Mac.

I have 12.8gb worth of photos and videos and I remember shooting videos in particular that was 1 hour long and another 30 minute one.\nLast night it didn't take long for the 5,000 photos (inc. short videos) like a few mins at best to come and the 6,000 photos rest is still pending it says \"Downloading 6,0000 xxxx originals\" in my Photos app. And my video for example that 1 hour one, (i sometimes record videos for YT on my phone) and the other 30 minute one hasn't come through so i wonder if that is what is slowing the restore process.\nGoogling online it says it can take 1-4 hours per gb to restore from an iCloud backup...\nI was thinking maybe it was faster to restore from iTunes...\niCloud backup total: 14.5gb\nPhotos and videos: 12.8gb\n\nA: There's really no definitive answer to this as a lot comes down to network speeds, bandwidth, what else you're currently doing with the device, and so on.\nThat is why you're finding that \"Googling online it says it can take 1-4 hours per gb to restore from an iCloud backup\" - because there's just too many variables involved. In fact, there are places in the world where 1Gb of data would take even longer than 4hrs to download.\nAs for your thinking that maybe it would be \"faster to restore from iTunes\", then it certainly would be if you're talking about a local iTunes backup that contains all of the photos and videos in question. Keep in mind though, a full \"restore\" means you're restoring your entire iPhone with what's in that backup, meaning that your phone ends up losing any data it currently has since that backup was made.\nHowever, if you have all of the photos and videos also stored on your computer (e.g. in the Photos app on a Mac, etc) then you could use iTunes to sync across the photos/videos you want from that source rather than restoring your divide from a backup.\n", "Q: There's a hidden file with extension .padl in my home directory and I don't know what it's for I saw that someone else asked the same question at superuser: https://superuser.com/questions/1008170/whats-the-498731-padl-file-for but there was no helpful answer so I'm trying here hoping to have more luck.\nLike my tag implies, I am not on Windows.

While using my iPad it suddenly froze and later it shut off altogether even though the battery was 90% charged.\nWhen restarting I looked at the screen and there was a small loading icon but no Apple logo. The loading screen just kept going and the iPad won't turn on. \nThe catch is, I can't use my restart button because the button is broken. This iPad is also old (probably an iPad 2).\nWhat can I do to try and get it to restart?\n\nA: If you iPad is currently spinning trying to boot and you don’t have access to the power button there isn’t much you can do at the moment. Hopefully allowing you Device to continue to try to boot will drain the batteries. This will allow your device to shut down, then start charging and hopefully it will boot up. Start charging with your computer so you can tell if your computer is recognizing the device while it’s booting. Going to About my Mac > System Profile > USB will show you if your device is registering with your computer. \nIf not, and you are comfortable following an ifixit tear down, you could take it apart to see if you can either clean up the power button (it’s probably dirty) or manually press the power-button if the little lever is broken on the button, which you could use for DFU or Recovery. \nSearch for your models water sensors, usually in the headphone and charging jack to see if there is water damage.  \n\nA: I would try plugging it into your computer to see if it's recognized by iTunes or your computer in general. Outside of that, you'd most likely need to visit an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, as you would most likely need a unit replacement or a button replacement. \n\nA: This can be a software issue or a combination of software issues. But if the power button could not work it cant be put into recovery mode or DFU mode. Or you couldn't force start it.

Then ran:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to get bounds of front window'\n\n=> 0, 23, 1440, 900\n\n\nSo, it looks like the menu bar is 23 pixels, and the width used by osascript is 1440. 1440 width in an HD ratio is 1440x810.\nSo, the command for me that results in a max width window that is HD ratio is:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to set bounds of front window to {0, 23, 1440, 833}'\n\nThe 833 is 810 + 23 to account for the menu bar height.\n", "Q: How do I create a directory structure? I ran these commands to make the directory:\nmkdir webpack-demo\ncd webpack-demo\nnpm init -y\nnpm install webpack --save-dev\nnpm install webpack-cli --save-dev\n\nand then type cd webpack-demo, then if I type ls I get \"node_modules\"       \"package-lock.json\" \"package.json\"\nbut then when I attempt to follow the next instructions from the webpack basic set up instruction page:\n  webpack-demo\n |- package.json\n+ |- index.html\n+ |- /src\n+ |- index.js\n\nI get the following output from terminal:\n|- package.json\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'\n+ |- index.html\n-bash: +: command not found\n-bash: -: command not found\n+ |- /src\n-bash: +: command not found\n-bash: +: command not found\n+   |- index.js\n-bash: +: command not found\n-bash: -: command not found\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: The instructions use the same formatting for commands you need to enter and for output, which is confusing.

I've been using an app called JDisk report which pinpoints the biggest space hogs on my drive. I've been trying to run it on the family iMac but the results are quite inaccurate because the only thing my user account has permission to access (and therefore the only thing it can scan) is my user folder, shared folders and public folders. I tried using the chmod command which I though would change the permissions of the folder to which it was executed on and all folders within, but it only does it per-folder, which makes the process extremely tedious. There must be a better way to do this.\nIf it helps, I'm running macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra on a mid-2011 iMac (base 500GB model except the RAM has been buffed to 12GB)\n\nA: chmod has an -R option to apply changes recursively to a whole directory tree but I strongly recommend to not use it for your scenario as you can break quite a lot of things by applying it in places where you shouldn't.\nInstead\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into your Mac as an administrative user and rerun JDisk.

Now I'm using python and the pyhap libary and it is working so far. \nI can control my Raspberry Pi using Apple HomeKit and the Home app. But there's one thing I consider a big disadvantage of HomeKit: it cannot be controlled from outside the Network without an iPad, HomePod or Apple TV working as a home hub.\nQuestion: Can I somehow turn my Raspberry Pi into a home hub so I can control my lights etc from outside my home?\n\nA: No, that's unfortunately not possible.\nThe official hubs (such as an iPad or AppleTV) communicates with Apple's servers that then communicate with the Home app in order to provide push notifications and \"proxy\" functionality.\nCreating a non-official hub would require you to be able to communicate with Apple's servers. This is not really possible without violating Apple's terms of services, and it is definitely not easily technically achieving anyways, as it would require reverse engineering the protocol, being able to provide valid certificates, etc.\nYou can however use your Raspberry Pi to control those non-HomeKit accessories when away from home - but it would require you to make your own client. I.e. it wouldn't be via the Home app, but you would need to create your own app, or host a web app on the Raspberry Pi that is available when away from home.\nIn addition to the above, there's a further option that might be doable depending on your exact setup. If you setup the Raspberry Pi to provide a network bridge via VPN, you could in theory use VPN software on your iPhone to access your home network as if you were directly connected it. Then HomeKit accessories would be directly accessible. This could be done by for example setting up OpenVPN in tap-mode on the Raspberry Pi and installing the client on the iPhone.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt 2 Dock - Display stops working after waking from sleep I recently bought a used Elgato Thunderbolt 2 dock off ebay and everything seems to be working fine apart from this display issue.\nHere are some details of the issue:\n\n*\n\n*The monitor is connected to the dock through the HDMI port of the dock.\n\n*Upon waking from sleep, the display flashes (the flash that occurs when a display is connected or disconnected) and the monitor no longer works and displays a 'No Signal'.\n\n*To get the display to work again via the dock, the mac has to be restarted.\n\n*Ethernet, USB ports and headphone/microphone ports of the dock work  when this issue occurs.\n\nSome steps I've taken in an attempt to solve/isolate the issue:\n\n*\n\n*Connecting a display directly from the mini display-port/thunderbolt port of the Macbook works.\n\n*Reconnecting the display and thunderbolt cable does not fix the issue.\n\n*Power cycling the dock (taking out the power adapter and putting it back in) does not work.\n\n*Using the second thunderbolt port on the Macbook does not work.\n\n*Disconnecting the HDMI cable from the dock and using the second thunderbolt port on the dock to connect a display via a mini-displayport adapter does not work.\n\n*Using another Macbook (a different model, more specifically a Macbook Air) works fine.\n\n*SMC and PRAM resets have been done already.

So suggesting this again is out of the question.\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nA: The actual problem was the thunderbolt cable itself. The cable was cracked on both ends, meaning that a good connection could not be established between the dock and macbook. Purchasing a brand new thunderbolt 2 cable from apple has solved this issue completely. \n\nA: I had this same issue and Elgato was unable to solve it so I just began plugging my monitor directly into my Macbook's (Retina mid-2014) HDMI port.\nAfter updating to Catalina I thought I'd try it again but now my monitor (Samsung 27\" full HD) wouldn't sync to my Mac though the Elgato HDMI port, however it would sync through a displayport-to-HDMI adapter plugged into the Elgato Thunderbolt 2 port. The problem of losing video after waking persisted, however.\nFinally I tried another monitor (LG 24\"Full HD) which I had in the house.  It worked perfectly and so far doesn't have the issue of losing video on wake. I'm reporting all of this to Elgato once again and will add additional information if they can provide a fix / explanation of why this works with LG monitro but not Samsung.  \n\nA: I had a similar problem.  MBP 16\" M1 with 2 external monitors using and Elgato Thunderbolt 3 hub.  Worked fine until a few weeks ago when the monitors would not wake up from sleep.  Had to reboot to fix it.  Frustrating issue.\nDISCOVERED THE SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM\nI was using the Elgato to power the MBP and not the adapter that came with the MBP.  Evidently, I had too many peripherals (ring light, iPhone charger, USB BT for Mouse) plugged into the hub.  Plugging in the adapter fixed my problem.

However, once I step over to take a selfie picture reality gets reversed on the digital end, right to left and left to right. Why?\n\nA: While taking the selfie, the displayed image is mirrored so you can line things up easier. This is demonstrated in the first image.\nAfter the photo is taken, the image is unmirrored and displayed naturally. This is demonstrated in the second image.\n\n\n\nA: I'm a little confused by what you mean by reality getting reversed.

I was just reminded of this incident, and was wondering if somebody could explain how this could be possible!\nIn 2012, I took a flight to America and used my iPod Touch 4th Generation throughout the trip - whilst Airplane Mode was enabled during the flight, when touching down and after collecting everything and exiting the airport terminal, I then disabled this feature so that Wi-Fi was once again enabled. It's important to note that at this point, I hadn't connected or done a search for any nearby Wi-Fi networks, and when checking the time on the iPod itself the device was still showing my local time - and not the new time of the state that I had flown to.\nSeveral hours later, when arriving at my hotel, I once again checked my iPod and to my surprise found that whilst I still hadn't connected to any Wi-Fi networks, the iPod had updated its time to match that of my new location. How would this have been possible if no network connectivity had taken place - is this a known feature? I haven't seen this since (and I've gone to America since this particular trip took place).\n\nA: I get the pop up message that Bluetooth can improve location acuracy or something like that; maybe you turned on Bluetooth somewhere in that time frame.\nAlso, referncing the fact that Google maps, and Tetsujin's comments below, Google maps seems to use something that acts like GPS, to tell me where I am while I have wifi turned off.

I will present a common work case here: I have an iPhone, an older iPhone, an iPad Pro, iPad, Macbook and iMac, and they have the same iCloud account. Is there a way to make the \"Handoff\" feature work more reliably on them?\nIt can be for the first 3 to 5 times, a short string copied on one iPhone can be pasted into the other iPhone / iPad. (assuming the iPhones are within 2 feet apart). But after these few times, the other iPhone / iPad would start to get \"jammed up\" and not able to paste the short string.

It is not a big issue except one iPhone or another constantly get jammed up, and it is wasting 5 minutes several times during the day, and they interrupt the usual workflow.\nAre there ways to improve the reliability?  All devices are on the same Wifi with Bluetooth turned on, although I think Handoff works off iCloud copy and paste, so sending 20 bytes from one iPhone to the iCloud server and the other phones getting back this 20 bytes shouldn't really be a big issue.  Right now sometimes it feels like, one phone cannot get the data from the iCloud server, and somehow jammed up in there, perhaps won't time out the bad connection even after a few minutes, and require a user to reboot.\nP.S. this happens even if it is 2 devices. Sometimes I have a URL to copy from the Macbook to the iPhone, and the iPhone won't be able to get it. I might have to reboot either the Macbook or the iPhone, or both, for it to work.\n\nA: No, it cannot be configured to be more reliable.\nIn practical terms, you'll need to ensure that the devices are within range of WiFi and Bluetooth. Besides that, there's not more that can be done.\nAs you have indicated in comments that you do not want suggestions for alternative solutions, I'll refrain from that.\n\nA: After some time, I did find some ways to make it work better:\n\n\n*\n\n*After copying something, it is better to wait 3 to 5 seconds before you try to paste it in the other device, because there probably is a delay for the copied info sent to the remote iCloud server. If it doesn't paste the first time, try and wait 3-5 seconds more and try again. And most of the time, the thing I copied and pasted were just 10 to 20 characters, not a few MB or something, so it is not related to throughput, but related to latency.\n\n*If you cannot paste to device 1 (such as your iPhone), but somehow can paste to device 2 (such as your iPad), sometimes you can just copy it on the iPad, and the iPhone can get it. So try to copy from another device and it may work better.\n\n*Try tuning Wifi off and on for a device that doesn't work, in this article. Sometimes it worked for me, sometimes not.\n\n*Sometimes it seems no matter what you do, a device just cannot paste. It is as if it had a bad connection and it won't time out that bad connection and still can't connect or something, and it won't try a brand new connection. In that case, turn off the device and turn it back on, and it should work.\nAfter using Handoff some more, I found that there are probably server side issue and client side issue. On the server side, note that there are millions of people copying stuff on their Apple devices, and Handoff will send the data to iCloud, possibly never getting pasted on any device at all. It could be a few KB, or a  few MB image, and it is uploading to the server, making the servers quite busy. So sometimes, I can try to paste after 3, 4 seconds, and it didn't work, but after 7, 8 seconds and it worked. That might be because the servers are too busy. It doesn't matter if you are trying to paste 20 bytes. If other people all over the world are sending tons of data to the servers, it depends whether their servers are non-busy.\nOn the other hand, sometimes I copy from iPhone and can paste to the Macbook, and no matter what I do, the data won't paste to iPad. So sometimes I copy that same data from Macbook and then now it can paste to iPad. There are also times, no matter what I do, the data can't paste to the iPad, unless if I turn off Wifi on the iPad and turn it back on and try again, or better yet, reboot the iPad and it will work. In this case it seems like it is the client side that might had a bad connection and it just got jammed there.\n", "Q: How to change bluetooth frequency for magic mouse 2 \n*\n\n*Sometimes my Magic Mouse does not work when Wi-Fi is on!\nWhen I turn Wi-Fi off, I can move it again!\n\n*MacBook freezes frequently and it really drives me crazy! I guess it isrelated to the Wi-Fi, because when I turn Wi-Fi off, MacBook works better.\n\n\nMacBook 2019 - Mojave 10.14.6\nI read this question about Logitech mouse.  But I use magic mouse 2, not other brands.\nI read this Apple Discussions article. My modem frequency is 2.4 GHz too. and unfortunately, it supports  only this frequency. \nCan I change Bluetooth frequency from 2.4 GHz to something else?\n\nA: The short answer is no.\nThe 2.4 GHz frequency is what bluetooth uses so you would need to move to a place with less interference, turn off the conflicting devices to keep using Bluetooth reliably.\nThere are other frequencies mice, but Apple doesn’t make them. Look at Microsoft or Logitech if you don’t know where to start with mice that have a USB receiver and use other radio frequencies.\n\nBluetooth devices intended for use in short-range personal area networks operate from 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz. To reduce interference with other protocols that use the 2.45 GHz band, the Bluetooth protocol divides the band into 80 channels (numbered from 0 to 79, each 1 MHz wide) and changes channels up to 1600 times per second\n\nSo, if you have interference bad enough that BlueTooth can’t accomodate or negotiate a channel, something is really wrong. I would focus on software updates, resetting devices, turning off WiFi for 30 minutes to be sure you really have an interference problem\n\nA: I am experiencing something similar, and it is actually the Apple Magic Mouse 2 that creates all the interferences with other Bluetooth devices.\nI guess something got very wrong in my mouse. If it is on, no Bluetooth device works properly\n", "Q: Why does Apple not recommend storing your iMovie library on an external drive? I want to try keeping my iMovie library on an external drive because I use both my Imac (at home) and my MBP (when traveling) to edit my videos.  Ideally, I would like to use a SD card so that it doesn't draw power from my MBP, but it may be too slow? It will also free up hard drive space on both computers. But when searching about this, Apple's support page says it's possible but advises against it:\n\"You can store your library on an external storage device such as a USB drive, FireWire drive, or Thunderbolt drive formatted as MacOS Extended (Journaled). Apple doesn’t recommend storing iMovie libraries on external storage devices like SD cards and USB flash drives, or drives shared on a network.\"\nDoes anyone know why this is so? I want to make sure it's not damaging in anyway.\n\nA: \"Apple doesn’t recommend storing iMovie libraries on external storage devices like SD cards and USB flash drives, or drives shared on a network.\"\n'cause the quality of external flash cards are poor.  I have like eight flash drives bought in the last eight years and two of them have failed.  External cards use a double layer of circuits where as internal SSDs use one. \nLibrary of Congress has a question and answer email facility.  I sent them a line about flash drives.  I found out that:\n\nLoC does not have data on the reliability of usb memory sticks.\n  LoC recommends the use of rotating magnetic media for long term digital storage.\n\nHere is what Library of Congress says about long term storage photos.  I assume that vids would be the same. \nThis is controversial around these parts, but I recommend you get your photos out of the Apple ecosystem and store them as one photo per file on multiple external storage devices. For long term storage, don't rely on usb memory sticks nor external ssd drives.  LoC does not have data on the reliability of usb memory sticks.  Apple seems to be saying do not store photos on external ssd drives.  One device should be off site.  Using a cloud service is fine.  Remember a lot of cloud services are sync services.  That is should the file be deleted on the local device, the photo will be deleted in the cloud.  For this reason,  I never install the cloud service software on my computer.  I use only file upload.  For those who complain, my assessment is that the apple Eco-system doesn't match Library of Congress's requirements for digital archiving.\ninformative video:\nhttp://www.digitalpreservation.gov/multimedia/videos/personalarchiving-photos.html\nprinted version\nhttp://www.digitalpreservation.gov/personalarchiving/photos.html\nGeneral information on digital preservation:\nhttp://www.digitalpreservation.gov/personalarchiving/\nR\n\nA: Apple's advice does allow the use of external drives, but not SD cards or USB flash drives, presumably because these devices are not reliable for long-term, regular usage. They're fine to transfer files from one place to another, or for an additional copy.\nI've never heard of any reason against storing photos, movies, and music on 'standard' external volumes, except for confusing the applications if the drive gets removed while in use, or if it is not there at launch. That might be why Apple doesn't recommend network drives.\nI use an external USB drive for my media, as my internal storage is not expensive large enough, and have not had any problems.\nAs with Apple, I'd recommend you use a 'proper' USB drive. Whichever storage you choose, you will need to have a backup.\n\nA: I just lost around 2hrs of iMovie work due to having my Library on an SD card. All of a sudden, iMovie reported that it will close the library because it cannot access it. iMovie quit, and the library was Zero KB. Nothing worked. This is the second time this happens with a different card. So I guess Apple was right.\n\nA: An iMovie library holds all the media and data used to make movies in iMovie. If your iMovie library is large and you want to free up storage space on your Mac, you can move your iMovie library to an external drive.\n", "Q: After hard shutdown, Audacity won't start Similar to this question (that one related to Ubuntu), but I'm asking about Mac.\nWhen I try to run audacity I get the following error message:\n\nThe system has detected that another copy of Audacity is running.\n  Running two copies of Audacity simultaneously may cause data loss or\n  cause your system to crash.Use the New or Open commands in the\n  currently running Audacity process to open multiple projects\n  simultaneously.\n\n\nA: On Mac, this was really annoying.\nBased on this link, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to /Users/Myname/Library/Application Support/audacity (replace Myname with yours of course)\n\n*Open file audacity.cfg in text editor\n\n*Under section [Directories], find TempDir, which may look like this: /Users/Myname/Library/Application Support/audacity/SessionData\n\n*Go to that folder, and delete file audacity-lock-Myname\n", "Q: Mac Terminal Padding Is it possible to add window padding to Terminal.app?

I would like to write a set of shell scripts which would execute smoothly on Mac disregarding where they are called from.\nI am currently struggling about how to implement this.\nOn windows, I could write three batch scripts\nA.bat in folder A\nB.bat in folder Subfolder, which is subfolder of A and which path is A/Subfolder\nC.bat in folder Subfolder, which is subfolder of A and which path is A/Subfolder\nIn A.bat I could write\ncall Subfolder/B.bat\n\nin B.Bat I could write\ncall C.bat\n\nand both scripts A and B would execute successfully.\nOn Mac, however, I have to prepend ./ to every script so that it is recognized as script.\nSo when I write in a.sh code:\nSubfolder/b.sh\n\nand then in b.sh code\n./c.sh\n\nwhen I execute ./b.sh from terminal it is executed successfully.\nHowever, when I execute ./a.sh from a parent folder in terminal, it fails with error\n\n./a.sh\nSubfolder/b.sh: line 1: ./c.sh: No such file or directory\n\n\nIs this possible on Mac to write a code in b.sh which would execute disregarding if it is called from the current folder or from the parent folder?\n\nA: There are two concepts relevant to understand what's going on here:\n\n\n*\n\n*when running binaries or shell scripts as name-of-executable, the shell looks into $PATH for the list of directories the binary/shell script could be stored it. The first match found is then used to run the binary/script, if no match is found you get an error message. If instead you run it as ./name-of-executable or /path/to/executable $PATH is not searched but the path is taken either relative to the current directory (if it starts with ./ or ../) or absolute\n\n*each process (including each shell script) has a default directory it runs in and which gets inherited to any child processes started\n\n\nSo in your case if you run ./a.sh the current directory remains the one a.sh is stored in even when subfolder/b.sh is running, which then lets ./c.sh fail.\nThe easy way out of this to always change directories before calling child processes (and of course changing back afterwards). So in a.sh you would write\ncd subfolder\n./b.sh\ncd ..\n\nwhich would allow b.sh to call ./c.sh within the same subfolder without problems.\n\nA: I'll claim there are three relevant concepts you are (/may be) running into trouble with here:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a unix-style shell, when you use a command name that doesn't include a \"/\", it's looked for in the directories in the PATH environment variable (places like /bin, /usr/bin, etc), not anyplace relative to where you are (or some current script is). On the other hand, if it does contain a \"/\", it's treated as a path for the command/script to run. Using ./ in front of a script name is just a way of specifying a path to a file in the current directory.\n\n*In unix (including macOS), when you specify a relative path (to a document, script, or whatever), it's resolved relative to the process's current working directory; in a script, this is generally not the directory the script is in, but the directory the user (or whatever) was in when it ran the script.\nSo if you're in /Users/patlatus and you run a script in /Users/patlatus/Documents/scriptproject, and the script refers to Subfolder/b.sh, it'll look for /Users/patlatus/Subfolder/b.sh. Finding files relative to the script is tricky, and not always possible (or even well-defined), but bash you can usually derive it from $BASH_SOURCE. Something like this:\nscriptdir=$(dirname \"$BASH_SOURCE\")    # Find the current script's directory\n\"$scriptdir/Subfolder/b.sh\"            # Run a script in a subdirectory of that\n\n\n*When you run a script just with its path (or name), it'll run as a subprocess. This means it inherits copies of any variables exported from the parent script, but not unexported variables, and any changes it makes to variables will not propagate back to the parent script's shell. This is different from how call works in a batch script; call is closer to running another script with the source command (or its synonym .), which runs it in the same shell process (with full access to variables etc). If you want this, use the . or source command:\nscriptdir=$(dirname \"$BASH_SOURCE\")    # Find the current script's directory\n. \"$scriptdir/Subfolder/b.sh\"          # Source a script in a subdirectory of that\n\nNote that since the sourced script shares variables, if it redefines scriptdir as its directory, that'll affect its value in the calling script as well.\nNote that the . command has nothing whatsoever to do with the \".\" in ./scriptname -- that's just a relative path starting from the current directory, not a command.\n", "Q: Listening to music with MacBooks lid closed My headphone is connected to my 2019 MacBook Pro. Is there any way to listen music when it's lid is closed? I am using a Beats studio wireless.\n\nA: Your MacBook will normally always go to sleep when you close the lid, and that unfortunately will stop the music playing.\nBut there is a way to stop your Mac from going to sleep when you close the lid with a simple shell command.\nDisable sleeping when lid is closed:\nsudo pmset -a disablesleep 1\n\nRe-enable sleeping when lid is closed:\nsudo pmset -a disablesleep 0\n\n", "Q: Can I find out the last time a specific USB was connected to my MBP?

Is this possible in any way using the system.log files?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: If your MacOS version is 10.12 and later, you can use the advanced terminal log tool.\nhere is how to do the same with it (if you prefer)\nlog show  --last 35m  --info --predicate 'eventMessage contains \"mounted\"'\nhere it will search for messages containing the word \"mounted\", but only messages of type INFO (you could change it for ERROR or omit the --info flag to search all messages) \nYou can change the time, on the example I used --last 35m which means only on the last 35 minutes, but you can use it like --last 4h to search the last four hours for your criteria.\nExample output, click to expand it:\n\nIf you know the service subsystem, you can filter just by it, like the example below (I created the example for timeMachine subsystem, for syntax demonstration)\nlog show --predicate 'subsystem == \"com.apple.TimeMachine\" AND eventMessage contains \"Failed\"'\nUse additional parameters like last hours, select kind of message, redirect the output to a file, etc...\nThe log console is very powerful and it can make queries like a database tool.\n\nIt is faster if you use the query syntax like above, but for some quick searchs you can also use 'grep', like the example below:\nlog show --style syslog  --last 15m  --info |grep '\\[USB\\]' \nShow USB connection of my iPhone on my MacBook on the last 15 minutes: (using GREP to filter messages) and output style syslog\n\nStatistics about the log database can be retrieved with sudo log stats (picture below) showing the date of the oldest message, date of most recent, and various other information and statistics.\nStatistics (the command may take a long time to generate it, (> 5min ~ 10min)\n\n\nHow much data/days to store?

Run longer to be sure the issue goes away. \nRunning fine in safe mode means something installed on your machine is causing the trouble.

Thanks to Apple support.  I had the same problem as everyone here.  So on a lark I went to the Apple website, clicked on downloaed problems.  Within seconds I get a call, then go on hold for 30 seconds or so, and this really nice and really patient Apple support staff is on the line.  On a Sunday!!! We walked through the problem, repeating steps.  Once the softwareupdate utility was run it was fixed.  Yippee for Apple support!!  If this had not worked he said he would have done the network install others have described.  ( Command-Option-R )\n\nA: For me I was stuck with a terminal that refused to open. I ended up deleting the previous beta installer I found on the second page of the launch pad. Once I deleted it and then re-ran the macOSDeveloperBetaAccessUtility.pkg file again I was able to download and install the newest beta.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (2011) shows flashing folder at startup but the disk is valid I have a MacBook Pro (early 2011) and recently the laptop boots to a white screen that flashes a folder with a question mark.

My next action would be to make a Genius Bar appointment because I'm worried to logic board is somehow faulting.\nedit: I tried another test with mixed results. I swapped the hard drive cable from my functioning MBP in to the faulty MBP and the laptop booted successfully. However, a few moments after login the screen switched to white with the flashing folder/question mark.\nI moved the faulty hard drive cable in to the functioning MBP and the laptop failed to boot successfully.\nMy signs are kind of pointing towards a faulty hard drive cable. $45 for a replacement on iFixit seems kind of steep...\n\nA: The problem was a faulty hard drive connector cable. I ordered a replacement from iFixIt and the laptop is functioning again. \n", "Q: CMD + W doesn't work anymore on macOS Mojave After installing the .dotfiles on my new Macbook (Mojave) the keyboard combination CMD + W to close tabs or windows stopped working system wide.\nI found out that when I press fn + CMD + W it works.

Still don't know what caused the problem…\n\nA: This is a decade old, but suggests it has something to do with the\nOmnibox flag:\nhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45928#c22\n", "Q: Best practices for second hard drive on macOS I’ve a 1TB Mac Mini (Seagate hybrid HD + SSD) but I’m running out of space so I bought a second drive (Samsung 860 EVO 1TB). \nSince it is as large as the first hard drive I don’t think using fusion drive would be a good idea and since the new drive is faster I think I should make it my boot drive, but how should I integrate the two to make the best of the new speed storage?\nI’m thinking of migrating my user account to the new drive and keep iTunes Library, Photos Library and iMovie Library in the old drive. This 3 libraries are my main storage hogs. If that’s all, I think I don’t even need hard links.\nAny additional tips and suggestions?\n\nA: Internal or external? Which (exact model) of Mac Mini? Without that info this answert is gonna be vague.\nIf it is an external SSD connected via USB-C/Thunderbolt. you could do what I did, install masOS on the external and boot from it and then use migration utility to move everything to the external SSD and used the old internal drive for incidental storage and as an \"emergency\" boot drive.\nIf it is a slower interface I would benchmark your current setup. Install your OS and files on the external and benchmark it again, then decide how to configure it.\nDepending on what is in your user folder in the way of files (what kind, text, graphics, video, music) and how much you use it you could keep your user folder on on the slower drive. Mostly text docs, PDFs and the like should be no problem, but if you are editing a lot of video or graphics that is I/O intensive, keep your files on the faster drive.\nIf you are installing a second internal drive I would pretty much do it the same way. An internal SSD would be really fast and you would get full benefit of the speed on the internal bus. I'd put everything on the SSD.\n", "Q: The macOS Mojave installer is not responding on my mid-2013 MacBook Air I don't  know why this is happening but 4 days ago due to some storage issue I completely cleaned my MacOS Mojave installed MacBook Air Mid 2013 and after clean up it came up with MacOS Mountain Lion: \n\nMy Specs: \n\nNow I want to upgrade it to MacOS Mojave again, so I downloaded the Install macOS Mojave Installer: \n\n\nBut in the end it does not work as it's meant to. When I try to launch it it shows Not Responding all the time: \n\n\nHas anyone else in this beautiful world faced this issue? Can someone suggest a solution?\n\nA: It's not clear what \"I completely cleaned my MacOS Mojave installed Macbook Air Mid 2013\" means, but reading between the lines I'm assuming you have no user data on your internal drive.\nIf that's the case and all you want is to have macOS Mojave installed before adding back your user data, I'd start the process again as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Power up your Mac again but immediately press and hold the option⌘R keys1\n\n*Keep the keys down until you see either an Apple logo or spinning globe appear on screen (Note: If you have a firmware password set on your system, then let go of the keys when the password prompt appears)\n\n*Once the Utilities window appears you'll be in macOS Recovery Mode\n\n\nNow choose to reinstall macOS and follow the prompts.\n1. This choice of macOS Recovery keyboard shortcut allows the user to install the latest version of macOS that is compatible with your Mac. Since that's currently macOS Mojave, this should result in that being installed. You could also try using the ⌘R shortcut instead which allows you to install the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, but without knowing what you've previously done this may not work as expected.\n", "Q: Can my Early 2013 15\" MacBook Pro connect to a 30\" Apple Cinema Display... or two? Someone in my area is selling some 30\" Apple Cinema Displays for a pretty decent price and I'm thinking about getting one for my home office to use with my Early 2013 15\" MacBook Pro. From what I understand, I would need a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter in order to get the display's native 2560x1440 resolution, but it looks like the seller is including one (whether or not they realize it didn't originally ship with the monitor).\nBonus question: if I picked up two of these (like I said, the price is pretty good), would my laptop be able to use them both at once? I have two Thunderbolt ports (assuming the seller throws in two adapters), but I don't know if there's an internal hardware or software limitation.\nI'll certainly bring my laptop to test things out, but I figured I'd check before heading to meet the seller and potentially save myself a trip.\n\nA: Theoretically, yes.\nFrom https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.4-15-early-2013-retina-display-specs.html: \nThis model supports a simultaneous maximum resolution up to 2560x1600 on two external displays via Thunderbolt. Alternately, it can support a single display up to 2560x1600 via Thunderbolt and a single display up to 1920x1200 via HDMI. Although it can theoretically power all three external displays, as confirmed by a helpful reader, it runs too hot with three displays connected.\n", "Q: Delete a folder with a lot of files I'm not even sure how to ask this question properly, but let me try.\nI'm on Mojave 10.14.\nI found a directory in my trash can that is extremely slow to delete. When I try to go into the directory, finder shows spinning at the bottom and does not displays the files in it. I've waited well over 10 mins.\nWhen I try to use \"ls\" cmd in the terminal, it also takes over 10 mins and does not display anything.\nWhen I try to empty the trash, it is EXTREMLY slow. The # of files deleted increases 1 per second (almost). I've waited well over 30 mins and it was still not finished.\nHow do I diagnose this problem and find a solution?\nUpdate 1: Filesystem is APFS and the directory has more than  12,000,000 small json files.\nUpdate 2: Finally counted the # of files and total size of the directory. The directory has 22,203,359 files and 27.59GB.\n\nA: unix.stackexchange.com once told me that rsync is the fastes way to delete many files:\nmkdir empty_dir\nrsync -a --delete empty_dir/    yourdirectory/\n\nMaybe this helps here.\n\nA: When I try to use \"ls\" cmd in the terminal, it also takes over 10 mins and does not display anything.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is not normal.  Something is amiss. I'd see the most likely cause as either a bad filesystem or a failing drive. While surprising, it could be a bad spot on the drive just where the directory is.  In the case of a failing drive, macOS will try multiple reads to see if it can retrieve the data. \n/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility\ngoto the First Aid tab.

It might be easier/faster to run\nrm -r ~/.Trash\n\nin Terminal (at least it won't partially block the UI while doing so).\nPS: If the files to be deleted are on an external drive you need to delete them from /Volumes/VOLNAME/.Trash instead.\n\nA: 22 million files at 1 millisecond each will take over 6 hours.\nI've no idea if that's a realistic estimate for the unit time, but the Finder is traditionally not the most efficient at file operations.\nAnd I wouldn't trust its 'progress' dialog, either. https://xkcd.com/612/\nYou should leave the process to run for as long as it takes.\n\nA: I saw some suggestions for rm -rf ./dirname to delete a lot of files in the terminal.  It appears nothing is happening, but it's because you won't see what it's doing unless you use the \"verbose\" flag of -v.\nSo try:\nrm -rfv ./YOUR_DIR_NAME_YOU_WANT_TO_DELETE\nThen you can see the files being deleted as they go.  Since there are a large number of them, it may take a while.  Note that verbose mode might slow it down in the end, but I prefer to see that it's still working.\n\nA: Even \"simple\" tools like rm are actually several thousand lines of code and full of complicated features that slow them down. In addition, almost all filesystems are not designed to hold large numbers of files in a single directory (10,000 is a sensible upper limit or 1,000 if using a GUI file browser).\nHere's a simple script that uses low level UNIX APIs (unlink() and rmdir()) to delete each individual item in the directory, using the nftw() API to scan through the directory.\nSimply save it as a text file, make it executable, and run it.

Mojave on my iMac routinely applies its own updates and reboots itself, with most running programs returning to a reasonable copy of their pre-reboot state. That's fine, especially since these updates can take quite a long time. I don't want to sit waiting for them.\nBut I do web app development, and there are typically several different node.js web servers running in terminal windows. It's convenient to leave them running all the time. Using nodemon, they automatically restart when I change the server code, which is handy.\nBut when an update wants to reboot the system, the terminal windows running the servers all ask me whether I'm OK with killing the process, and sit waiting for an answer. Meanwhile, I'm in bed. And in the morning I have to say \"yes\", and then wait tediously for the update to complete. If I don't do it then, I forget about it, and see just the same thing the next morning.\nIs there any way that I can script my code to tell the terminal program in advance that, if someone asks, it is ok to kill the running process?\n\nA: Open Terminal Preferences → Profiles → your profile → Shell and switch ‘Ask before closing’ to ‘Never’.\n\n", "Q: Can I push notify based on geo-fencing without an iOS App?

There is no hook to automate what you contemplate as the device just receives a notification. \nSimilarly, the workflow automation let’s you get a location but not set up geofence push notifications. \nYou need to make or use a third party app to use location notifications and APNS as you requested on iOS 12 and below. \nTo achieve your goal without an app, convince Apple this needs to be added to the OS and to the workflow app to have geolocation triggers. \n", "Q: Activity Monitor - How to view multiple panels at the same time I'm currently trying to view multiple metrics at the same time using Activity Monitor app (yes I have tried top, htop, etc but I was wondering if this is possible with Activity Monitor). \nFx. looking at the CPU and Memory panels without having to switch between them.\nThanks guys!\n\nA: You can choose your own set of columns to be displayed on any particular tab by right-clicking on the column headers (or View → Columns) and checking columns to be displayed.

It was running a fully updated Mojave OS before running Bootcamp Assistant. Installed Windows 10 image from Microsoft download. After installing Windows all worked fine and did all its updates. But now, none of the Mac startup keyboard commands work. I can't launch startup manager or recovery mode. It just goes straight to Windows. If I use the Bootcamp windows control panel to choose start up only Windows appears in the list. If I choose Advanced Startup Options in Windows I choose a USB or drive but it just boots straight back into Windows 10.\nI've tried every shortcut on this page (on a USB keyboard) https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255\nEven the PRAM reset shortcuts don't work. Is it the UEFI? How do I reset this?\nAny ideas?\n\nA: It sounds like you updated the firmware on the video card. The drive selection screen and other startup keystrokes work from the original EFI. This likely happened when updating W10. You may have accidentally also updated a video driver that included a VC firmware update. Been there, done that. Getting the card re-flashed to the Apple VC EFI is likely to be difficult and/or expensive. This is especially true since this is an iMac. The video card is integrated into the logic board. My solution won't work for you, unfortunately.\nPerhaps an Authorized Service Provider can flash it. If you're not sure where to go, try Apple first. Call (800-275-2273) or go to the support site and when you get through all the repair prompts, it will show a map of the services near you. Perhaps the Genius Bar can flash it, too. Don't let 2013 deter you from calling. They may be able to help on the phone (doubt it), but they can at least help you find a place to get it done.\nIf you have not been able to start the Mac OS, as a Hail Mary, try holding 'x' during startup to see if you can get the MacOS to start (which you may have already). Or use Target Disk Mode to remove the Windows partition. When the Mac can't find an OS on the selected startup disk, it looks for a new one and it may startup from the Mac OS. Then you can use Sys Prefs to change your startup disk back to the Mac OS.\nHowever, if you no longer have a Mac OS (deleted partition maybe?), then it will start in Internet Recovery. If you have a Time Machine backup, you can restore the your original Mac OS and content using your backup. Otherwise, you will have to reinstall the OS.\nLet me say this. My experience with the issue (update Windows, flash card, no startup keystrokes) does not fit your scenario exactly so I could be totally wrong. If you don't have a backup and have data to retrieve, try Target Disk Mode before making any changes. You can save important data (assuming it still on the hard drive) to an external hard drive.\nGood luck.\n\nA: I had the same issue. Using bluetooth or wireless keyboard was the problem in my case.

The Terminal tabs in OS X can sometimes trigger a persistent \"bell\" condition where a bell icon appears in the title tab, and every time I navigate to that tab using cmd-tab, the alert sound occurs, and the bell icon fades away, and then whenever I change tabs again, the alert sound occurs again and the bell icon reappears. Switching screens can also trigger the same pair of alert sounds.\nThe upshot of all of this is that I can easily enter a condition where I'm hearing spurious alert noises many times per minute; it's irritating. Obviously, I can just close that particular tab, but this causes several problems--I many have long-running processes in the background of that tab, or a specific arrangement (the leftmost tab contains a particular job, for instance.\nEDIT: I think I didn't make it clear that I don't want to disable the bell sound; I want it to occur when a bad thing happens.

I have an Apple watch series 4 which comes with built-in ECG feature then Why it does not have that? Is there any problem? Is there anything to do with Location? \n\nA: The ECG function requires approval from the relevant regulators in the region, which takes time to acquire.\n\nIn the US, Apple worked with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a number of years to receive De Novo classification for the ECG app and the irregular heart rhythm notification, making the features available over the counter.

It is only available within the Secure Enclave. This means that even though you know your password, you cannot rebuild the AES-key from it on a different computer.\nThis means that it is not possible to do what you want (i.e. dumping the raw disk contents and decrypting it on another computer using AES keys that you build from your own password on that computer).\nIn regards to dumping raw disk content, you can use the dd command if you want - but you cannot really use it for anything.\n\nA: You will need to get your hands dirty. Presuming its an iPhone that you won't necessarily be using again...\nYou'll need to disassemble the phone, removing the flash parts (the disk as most people call it).  You must do this carefully since you will need to replace the flash parts and Secure Enclave such that they do not become unpaired with each other.\nCopying the raw contents of the flash parts will allow you to review whether anything is stored in plain text, but I can save you the trouble...everything on the business side of the Secure Enclave is encrypted.\nIf you've been very careful, you can boot the phone and try to access known data. You'll want to have a logic analyzer on both sides of the Secure Enclave so that you can see what it got from which part of the flash. Pinouts for the flash parts are well known, but the BGA layout for Apple's custom ASIC are somewhat nebulous.\nWith considerable effort, you can for different data patterns to be read, but if your fake responses are too wrong, a bus error is generated and the entire thing stops working until you remove power and have another go.\nHonestly, it's just not worth it unless somebody will pay you millions for the data you retrieve.

I have a Samsung FIT external drive with two partitions. One is ExFAT for interchange with Linux Systems. The other partition is APFS (Encrypted). I would like to backup the APFS volume using snapshots so I can \"roll back\" changes in case one of the Virtual Machines I got on it gets broken. Is there a way to do this? Or is the APFS Snapshot utility only for Bootable Drives? I tried tmutil snapshot /Volumes/APFSVolumeName but when I tried to list local snapshots I got nothing.\nI guess my only option is good old Disk Image of the Volume, right?\n\nA: TL;DR: Use the hypervisor's native snapshots, and never use APFS snapshots on a volume with VMs.\nCarbon Copy Cloner is a good utility to manually manage APFS snapshots. Open the program, switch the UI from Simple to Normal mode (in the menu). In the volume table in the lower left of the main window, you can click on any volume and a pane opens that shows the snapshots, and lets you delete old ones. You can create snapshots by running a backup task - even a dummy one that copies just one file to some folder.\nThe problem is that when you have a disk with VMs on it, you should only ever use one snapshot mechanism: either APFS snapshots, or the hypervisor's snapshots, not both. I suggest that you never use APFS snapshots on any disk with VMs, and use the hypervisor's native snapshots. They are a much more mature technology.\nThe snapshots work by retaining all of the old data, so their effective size grows over time - no data after the most recent snapshot's timestamp is ever removed from the disk. If you use hypervisor snapshots on top of APFS snapshots, the space usage doubles and you will run out of space while doing things that should conserve space.\nFor example, start with a single 600Gb VM, with VMware snapshots, on a 1TB APFS volume. You want to delete a 200Gb snapshot from that VM: VMware will integrate the snapshot into the higher level disk image. The problem is that this will effectively write 200Gb of \"new\" data to disk - APFS doesn't have deduplication!! Thus, the APFS snapshot will have to preserve the previous state of those 200Gb's worth. You think you should reclaim 200Gb of space, but you end up using 400Gb more, and get a full volume.\nAt least on macOS 10.13, AFPS has bugs and APFS volumes that run out of space due to APFS snapshot activity become unusable. You won't be able to delete the APFS snapshots, nor do anything else on that disk. It's nominally read-only, all write attempts will be failing with a weird \"permission denied\" error. Your only recourse will be to make a backup of the disk, then erase/reformat it (How do I know? It just happened to me and it's totally reproducible).\n", "Q: How to turn off connections when MacBook lid is closed I have a friend who wants his connections (WiFi, Bluetooth, ext...) to turn off when his lid is closed. He doesn't want to change a lot of settings (sleep mode, turning it off manually ...). \nIs there a simple way to do this through macOS System Preferences?

After I closed the plot, the two icons remain.\nEach has a dot under it, and a little arrow on the bottom left corner.\n\n\n*\n\n*When I type exit() at the python prompt the Python icon disappears and the iTerm icon remains unchanged.\n\n*When I close iTerm the dot disappears, but the arrow remains.\nExactly what do these indicate? What is it exactly that these dots and arrows are trying to tell me?\n  \n\nA: The short arrow is indicating alias. Some like that are also there in my Applications folder for apps which are located in ~/Library folder.\nSo I can guess that when first photo's original process is done, alias is still active. This happens to me while using OpenCV. closewindow() is hard to perform. I have to force quit it every time(it kills jupyter server too), or reuse the window. \n", "Q: I have Apple Remote Desktop installed both on my home and office, how do I make them see each other? I have already bought Apple Remote Desktop. And I want to control the other from each side. For example, I want to access files in my home Mac from office. But after running the Apple Remote Desktop, I can't see the computers from the list.\nWhat should I do? Both places have dynamic IP address. I have entered the IP address to search but still can't find the other.\nAnd do I need to make the computer non-sleeping? Even I kept them both unsleep, I can't find each other.\nReally hope to get more detailed tips.\nThanks\n\nA: There are several issues to address in order to successfully connect two different Macs in this scenario.\nConsider signing up for a dynamic DNS provider such as FreeDNS so that you can use a domain name rather than an IP to initiate a connection from the local Mac to the remote Mac.  With a small amount of scripting, or by creating a launchdaemon or launchagent, you can have both ends update their IP automatically.\nNext, you'll need to make sure that any router, firewall or other edge device on both networks have the proper ports open.  Apple's kbase article specifies ports 3283 and 5900, but make sure you have considered the risks of opening these commonly-used ports to the public Internet. \nAlso you will need to forward those ports from your router (which has the public/internet IP address) to your home Mac (which has a private IP address not available on the Internet). You may have to contact your ISP if you are unsure how to do that as there are as many ways of doing this as their are different types of routers.\nDepending on the network hardware on both ends, you might also be able to leverage a solution such OpenVPN or IPSec to create a persistent tunnel, but that won't remove the need to update the configuration when either end's dynamic IP changes.\nFinally, enable Remote Desktop access on both Macs.  Open System Preferences > Sharing and enable Remote Management.  Then, open the Apple Remote Desktop application on both Macs, choose Preferences (command-,), and from the Security pane, enable \"Allow control of this computer when this application is running.\"\nExposing these machines to the public Internet entails risks.  Make sure you are using long, strong passwords for the local accounts, that are not used anywhere else - longer is better than 'complicated'.  Have known-good backups and test them regularly.  Finally, make sure that enabling remote access to any device on your office's network won't violate your organization's security policies, AUP, etc.\nARD is still a good app for remotely managing and controlling Macs, but you may also be better served with a dedicated remote access tool such as LogMeIn or TeamViewer.\n", "Q: Macbook Screen Graphics Glitching From One Frame To Another My MacBook Pro (13.3 inch, MacOS Sierra 10.12.15,Late 2017) started to have grey horizontal lines appearing on my screen in Mid 2018. At first I thought it was not very serious and could deal with it, but later into 2019, a dark grey translucent stripe started appearing at the bottom of the screen.\nStill, I decided not to take action. It was when at the bottom of my screen started glitching and it started to take the graphics of a different app (swiping left/right with three fingers), but only at the bottom of my screen. The bottom started to have coloured glitches and little do you know, the top of my screen started to do the same. It was at the start of summer when it started to become worser than ever. \nBecause the usage of my MacBook has increased far more hours than usual, the whole display started to fail. For example, if I was to be watching Netflix, the screen would freeze on one frame, but continuing what was supposed to have been playing underneath the first frame that was frozen. I could only see what was happening because it froze translucently, where I would immediately turn off my laptop to prevent further damage.\nOther example that may occur would be when I am on one tab (let's say, a Spotify playlist), and then swipe across my trackpad to a Google Document filled with writing, and then to my desktop. My screen would have my desktop wallpaper with a translucent overlay of both the playlist and the text that I would have been working on, on the document. I figured the fault may have been because of a crack at the bottom my screen, although I do not understand how that may have happened. \n\nAny ideas on how to fix this problem?\n\nA: Take it to an authorized apple repair facility.  They are the only ones that can get new parts.  The labor is reasonable, $75 an hour if I remember right.  You can try and go with a used screen but you're taking your chances.  If you have apple care then they might replace the screen for free.  I can tell you that the retina screen is about $450 on a MacBook.  They will also do a free diagnostic to make sure the quote is accurate.  Looking on Amazon the price is about the same so might as well let the pros do it.\nAs far as the diagnostic part try plugging in an external display.  If the display glitches there too then it's probably not the screen.  Let us know what happens on an external display.\n", "Q: Automatically download software update over a specific network I want my mac to automatically download updates for me only if I am connected to a specific WiFi network.

I am running on Mojave 10.14.6\ntl;dr How do I get  ssh-add -d to work on macOS?\n\nA: After I post the question, I found the answer, the following command will generate the public key using the private key file:\nssh-keygen -y -f ./MyPrivateKey.pem > ./MyPublicKey.pub\n\nthen to remove it:\nssh-add -d \"MyPublicKey.pub\"\n\nReference\n", "Q: Unable to switch input sources after updating macOS to 10.14.6 After the latest update to Mojave 10.14.6, I'm unable to change input source using the keyboard shortcut (it works when I change it by selecting the input source manually).\nI tried changing it to different key combinations, rebooting, etc. but nothing works unfortunately. Before the update, everything was working fine. \nMy question is, is there any known issues/fixes on this? Thanks in advance.\nUPDATE\nI found out that the control key is causing the issue (Before, I tried only the shortcuts that contained it). I was using ^Space, however, when I change it to Shift+Space everything works fine. Has there been any change to the control key behaviour recently?\n\nA: I had the same issue with my mbp after the update. I called Apple support and they said it might be a software glitch that prevent this function from working. The solution I got was shutdown the computer, press the start button and as soon as I let go, press ^control+⌥command+P+R at the same time for 15-20 seconds, and login as usual. It solved my issue.\n", "Q: Deleted thousands of photos from Photos library, and the size is the same I have a a Photos library which is around 335GB.\nI deleted 23k photos from it (leaving only the photos from 2015-2016) and the size is almost the same: now the size is 330GB.\nAfter deleting them I also emptied the Recently Deleted album.\nHow to solve this? How to speed up the deletion process?\nUsing the latest Photos and macOS versions.\n\nA: Photos does not reclaim disk spaces immediately after you empty the Recently Deleted folder. Keep Photos opened and allow it to reclaim the disk space. It does take some time. I believe that they are the image caches, thumbnails, indices for searching and all other metadata files being cleaned up in the background. There are a lot of layers to how the photos are stored, so there is a lot of different files to clean up. I'd connect to the ac power and just don't let your disk or computer go to sleep.\n", "Q: Is there a way to figure out when was my ipad / iphone disconnected from charge cable? Ok, it may sounds weird but I just found my iPad in the trash (yeah you've read it right haha). So the last thing I remember that I connected it to the charge cable. After I arrived home I've found it in the trash disconnected from the cable. I thought I may can find more information from some history of logs or something. \nIt's a mystery.\n\n\n*\n\n*Was it my girlfriend?  \n\n*Or our cats?\n\n\nCan you help me figure this out?\n\nA: In my professional experience I say it was definitely the cats.\n\n\nA: There actually is a way to find out when your iPad was disconnected from the charging cable. If you have iOS 12, you can go to Settings -> Battery and look at the graph.\n\nThe part with the light green shadow with the little lightning symbol is the time when it is charging. When it gets unplugged, the light green section will stop and you can tell when your iPad was unplugged.\n", "Q: Very slow write performance 30min+ for 2GB - APFS?

I haven't been able to find anything online about this.\n\nA: Your model MacBook Pro can power external displays at 60Hz in the following combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*One display at 5120 x 2880 resolution with over a billion colors\n\n*Two displays at 3840 x 2160 resolution with over a billion colors\n\n*Two displays at 4096 x 2304 resolution with millions of colors\n\n\nSo, to use both the 5K and 4K displays you need to be mindful of the resolution they're each at. To change the resolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since you're trying to use a 5K display and a 4K display, I'd start by only connecting the 5K display first, preferably in one of the left ports\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences... > Displays\n\n*Make sure the Display tab is selected\n\n*Select the Scaled radio button\n\n*Now choose one of the scaled options that appear below (Hint: You can view the selected pixel dimensions below the image of your display on the left)\n\n*Once you have your display set at 4096 x 2304 (or below), exit System Preferences\n\n*Connect your 4K display to one of the right ports\n\n*Now go back to Apple > System Preferences... > Displays\n\n*Make sure the Display tab is selected\n\n*Now hold down the option key to see the additional scaled options for the second display\n\n*Now choose one of the scaled options for the 2nd display\n\n*Exit System preferences\n\n\nSee the screenshot below for reference:\n\nREMINDER: If you're wanting to use billions of colours, then at Steps 5 and 11 you need to set your resolution at 3840 x 2160 or lower. Otherwise, if you're happy to use millions of colours, you  can set the resolution for each display as high as 4096 x 2304 each. Keep in mind the actual resolution choices you get will depend on your displays and the adapters you're using.\nLet me know if you're still running into problems and we can troubleshoot from there.\n\nA: Apparently, the MacBook Pro can only power external displays up to 5K resolution.\nWhat you can do to use both the monitors is:\nConnect one of the monitors (preferably the 5k first) and lower it's resolution way down, up to 720p perhaps, by following the steps as illustrated in\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/ph25175?locale=en_US\n\nThen connect the other monitor(4k), now the combined resolution is below/equal to 5k, depending on your adjustments. \nNow adjust the resolutions on both the monitors to suit your needs, while you do take care that the combined resolutions don't exceed 5k.\nUnfortunately, you will have to make some compromises with the resolutions with both the monitors.\nI personally haven't tried this out as I don't have the hardware available, so do tell me if it works.\n", "Q: How to delete the word in front of the cursor in terminal on Mac OS I've read fn + option + delete will delete the word in front of cursor.

The message is:\n\nTime Machine did not back up because the backup disk was previously encrypted but is no longer encrypted.\n\nThe backups have always been encrypted and I didn't change this. Only thing I can imagine is that it has something to do with an update from 10.13.5 to 10.13.6.

I've set up a VPN using Strongswan and this tutorial: (configure Strongswan on Ubuntu) and can now connect to it from my other computer on my home network.  However, I can’t reach it from Internet with IPsec or ssh connection.\nWhat am I missing? How do I fix it?  \n\nA: I will assume that your situation is like mine and most other at home: Your Mac mini and other computer is on a local network, you have a router and is connected to the internet using a service provider. Then there are four things needed to reach you mini from the internet.\n1) The mac mini has to be \"opened\" for access. It seems you have done this already.\n2) The internet provider needs to allow access from the internet to your computer. Some do, absolutely not all. And not necessarily on all ports. Some allow web on port 80 and 8080, some allow ssh. You need to check.\n3) You need to find out the IP adress to your home network, actually to your router. Logging in to the router might give you that. One problem is that it can change, the IP adress lease is time limited. Some service providers can give you a static IP adress, often at a cost. If not, you could use a dynamic DNS adress service.\n4) Finally, your router needs to take internet connections and transfer them to your Mac mini.

This has never been possible without third-party software and/or jailbreaking.\nIt was possible to use older iPods in \"disk mode\" as storage devices. However, this feature was never available for the iPod Touch, nor for any version of the iPhone.\nSome iOS applications support file transfer, and can have files transferred to them using iTunes. However, this feature is limited to specific file types, and does not appear as a USB storage device.\n\nA: AFAIR there never was an official way to access data on an iPhone/iPad from macOS through Finder.

This behaviour only happens for events after 25th   October 2019, and before March 30th. So all my distant future events are wrong, and even entering new ones online from an external browser, the event immediately jumps 3 days back. I have tried signing out of iCloud on all my devices, but it didn't seem to make any difference?\n\nA: I've been through similar issues (not the same issue ... but iCloud weirdness that I couldn't pin to any device).  Turns out it is possible to wedge iCloud even though all your local devices are ok.  \nThe fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take backups of everything you can (your computer, phone, iPad, etc.)\n\n*Go to each device you own and log out of iCloud \nIt is critically important you log EVERY device out of iCloud because the fix relies on you having zero devices that are logged in.\n\n\n*When NO devices are logged into iCloud, then (and only then) iCloud will dump it's cache for all data that it was syncing to your devices.  If even a single device remains connected to iCloud ... this will not happen.\n\n\nPick your most reliable device and log back into iCloud.  It will start syncing it's state (such as your calendar) to iCloud.\nYou can start re-reconnecting other devices back into iCloud one by one (I tend to do this very slowly to make sure each device has time to fully sync before I add the next device). \nIf the problem turns out to be corrupted iCloud cache (and this has happened to me), then this should fix it.  If the problem is with a specific device then you may need further steps.\n\nA: TL;DR: call 800-275-2273 for AppleCare; otherwise:\nIf adding events to the calendar in iCloud.com isn't working properly, it is much less likely that the issue is coming from your devices. Signing in and out on devices re-writes local files that maintain the calendar and deal with incoming or outgoing sync data. Just in case, have you restarted all your devices? To be clear, in iOS, restarting is using the slide to power off, not the hard reset. Slide to power off does maintenance on the device before it completely powers off. If that doesn't (didn't) help, try signing out of iCloud, restart the device, then sign back in.\nAnother test is to create a new calendar and see if it has the same issue. If not, you may just need to start using the new calendar instead.\nYou can test if the issue is coming from one of your devices by turning off Calendar in the iCloud preferences/settings on all your devices, then add an event on iCloud.com. If it doesn't work as expected, skip to the second to last paragraph below. If it works as expected, turn on the Calendar in iCloud preferences/settings for one device and try again. Repeat until it fails. Backup and restore the offending device back to factory and sign in with your Apple ID, but don't use your backup to restore the device. Once back on the home screen/desktop, go back to iCloud.com and try again. If it works, you have two choices: restore the device from backup to see if starts to fail again (if it fails again, the problem is in your backup and if it doesn't you're all set); or just use the device as new and rely on other methods to load your data again (starting, of course, with iCloud sync data).\nMake sure you have a backup before making any other changes, however. And I would recommend both iCloud and iTunes. Having more than one backup is never a bad idea when making changes.\nIf still not resolved, I recommend calling Apple (1-800-275-2273). They always support Apple ID issues. They might need your input to help resolve the issue. It is likely you're not the only one, but it may be that the number of individuals with this issue is such a small number that every Apple ID used in troubleshooting and debugging will help. They may not be able to help resolve the issue on the first contact and, if my theory is right, they will likely escalate, perhaps twice.\nSSL\n", "Q: monitor displays shows no picture in display settings and goes black randomly This is my first question so please pardon my mistakes.\nI use a Mid 2017 MacBook Pro with a HP V270 Monitor. The monitor connects fine using a USB-C to HDMI cable but the issue I'm having currently is that my monitor randomly goes off and then comes back on after few seconds. IT seems to be a connection issue but I'm not sure how to verify that but an odd that I noticed in the settings is that there isn't a picture on the monitor  but my MacBook screen displays a picture. Please do not confuse the picture I'm referring to with the on the hardware screen. Hardware screen shows a picture but goes off randomly. The screen in the picture above remains black no matter how I tweaked the settings beside it. Also I'm currently running the Catalina beta but I do not think the issue is from the beta because I've seen other users experience same issues.  \nMacBook Pro Mid 2017. 4 USB-C Ports and I've connected with both my lid open and closed(using an app called InsomniaX). I'm also using a direct cable from my USB-C port to HDMI.\n\nA: Assuming your cable is connected securely at both ends, the first thing to try is connecting the HP V270 display to a different USB-C port to see what difference, if any, this makes.\nIf this has no effect then I'd reset your NVRAM.\nResetting the NVRAM\nYour Mac uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on your MacBook Pro model follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, so go to Apple > Shut Down so you’re not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button (in your case this is the Touch ID button) and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nIf you still have problems after doing this, let me know.\n\nSince resetting the NVRAM and swapping the ports has had no real impact, I'd strongly recommend testing your display with another computer and/or trying a different cable. \nIn terms of the MacBook Pro itself, you could use Apple Diagnostics to test its hardware for some peace of mind. You can do this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \n", "Q: how to completely uninstall AirBeam TV?

When clamshell-ed the internal LCD display goes dark and also disappears from the System Preferences --> Displays --> Arrangements tab page.  My mouse cursor remains only within the external display.  Everything works as expected.\nThe new (2560x1440) external display connected via mini-DP works with no issues as long as the MBP internal display is also active.  I can turn down the internal display's backlighting to remove the visual distraction, but this still leaves it's video framebuffer active: it is listed in System Preferences... and the mouse pointer is not restricted to the external monitor video space and can go off into the internal display area.\n-- Fixes Tried so Far --\nLots of reading online, here (lots of good info) and other sites led me to try editing boot NVRAM parameters to force the internal display to be inactive, terminal commands suggested in other postings were tried (see below), different DP adapters, changing the new external monitor's settings: force DP v1.1. but nothing tried had the desired effect: to clamshell the internal display while using the external monitor (2560x1440) via DP. Unfortunately I cannot use DVI with the new external monitor because single channel DVI only supports (1920x1200) and I do not have a dual channel DVI cable or Apple cable adapter.\nThe terminal commands I've tried (after disabling SIP) are:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"niog=1\"\n\nsudo nvram -d boot-args\n\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"iog=0x0\"\n\nsudo nvram boot-args=niog=1\n\nI've also tried resetting the external monitor settings by removing the Folder ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/ \nCan anyone offer any other suggestions?\n\nA: As a start I think we need to establish if you can get your display to work correctly while your MacBook Pro is in closed-clamshell mode. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to your MBP (or pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse with your MBP)\n\n*Connect your MBP to an AC power source\n\n*Connect your Viewsonic display to your MBP \n\n*After your MBP desktop appears on your Viewsonic display, close your MBP's lid \n\n*If your display goes to sleep, press a key or click your mouse to wake it up\n\n\nNOTE: If your Viewsonic display doesn't wake up, then disconnect the display and shut down your MBP. Now connect your display while your MBP is off and then switch the MBP on. After logging in close the lid.

For example, an application I use to provide a couple of custom document icons has these entries:\n<key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n        <string>ruby-script_Icon</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n        <string>Ruby Source</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n        <string>None</string>\n        <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>public.ruby-script</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeIconFile</key>\n        <string>property-list_Icon</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n        <string>Property List</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n        <string>None</string>\n        <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>com.apple.property-list</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n\nThe app is just a proxy for the target application and is created by copying the following script into the Script Editor and saving it as an application, then copying the icon resources and editing its Info.plist.  It doesn’t really do anything but open files in the application I want (BBEdit in this case), but you could also perform other setup routines:\non open droppedItems\n    -- perform setup or whatever\n    set args to \"\"\n    repeat with anItem in droppedItems\n        set args to args & quoted form of (POSIX path of anItem) & \" \"\n    end repeat\n    do shell script \"open -b com.barebones.bbedit \" & args\nend open\n\nFrom there, I just use Finder’s Get Info window to make the proxy app the default application for those file types.  Using this approach I can assign custom icons, with double-click and drag operations that open the document(s) as usual, without having to alter the target application.\n\nA: I usually avoid GUI scripting like it's the plague, but for this project I had to resort to GUI scripting in the second half of the code. Save this following AppleScript code as an application. Double-clicking this app's icon in Finder will do nothing.  In short, any file you want to change its default application for, of those file types, just drag and drop that file onto this Droplet's icon and you will be given the option to choose a new application as the default application for those file types.\nThis AppleScript code works for me using the latest version of macOS Mojave.\non open of droppedItems\n    --  Executed when files are dropped on the script\n    repeat with thisFile in droppedItems\n        activate\n        set chosenApp to (choose application with prompt ¬\n            \"Choose  Your Preferred Default Application\" as alias)\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            set default application of thisFile to chosenApp\n            set fileName to name of thisFile\n        end tell\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            if locked of thisFile is true then set locked of thisFile to false\n            activate\n            repeat until frontmost\n                delay 0.1\n            end repeat\n            reveal thisFile\n        end tell\n        delay 0.1\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"i\" using {command down}\n            repeat until button \"Change All…\" of scroll area 1 of window ((fileName & \" Info\") as text) of application process \"Finder\" exists\n                delay 0.2\n            end repeat\n            delay 0.1\n            click button \"Change All…\" of scroll area 1 of window ((fileName & \" Info\") as text) of application process \"Finder\"\n            delay 0.2\n            if exists of button \"Continue\" of window 1 of application process \"Finder\" then\n                --click button \"Continue\" of window 1 of application process \"Finder\"\n                keystroke return\n                delay 0.1\n                keystroke \"w\" using {command down}\n            else\n                keystroke \"w\" using {command down}\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend open\n\nThis following animation is an example of me dragging a .png on to the AppleScript Droplet's icon.  The default application to open .png files on my computer was Preview.app  ad by dragging a .png on to the AppleScript Droplet's icon... I was able to change the default application to open ALL .png files to Photoshop\n\nYou may need to change the delay values in the code, to function correctly on your system. \nDon't forget to grant access permissions in System Preferences to allow your applet to control your system.\n\n\n\n\nA: You can check out my answer here to a similar question.\nThe salient, script-portion of it is a JavaScript For Automation (JXA) script that can change the default application for all files of a specified uniform type identifier.  It can be run in Script Editor by changing the language option in the navigation bar at the top of the window from \"AppleScript\" → \"JavaScript\".\nObjC.import('CoreServices');\n\nvar contentType = 'public.plain-text';\nvar appName     = 'Atom';\nvar bundleID    = Application(appName).id();\n\n$.LSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType(\n            contentType, \n            $.kLSRolesAll, \n            bundleID);\n\nOf course, you can also run it from within AppleScript using:\nrun script \"<code>\" in \"JavaScript\"\n\nThe above script used \"as is\" would set the application Atom (an open-source text editor) as the default application used to open/view/edit plain text files.  This roughly translates to files with extension \".txt\".\nThe link to the original answer contains more details and useful reading references to understand more about UTIs if you aren't already familiar with them.\n\nA: I would recommend SwiftDefaultApps which is described as \"Replacement for RCDefaultApps, written in Swift\".\n(Longtime Mac users will remember RCDefaultApps as a preference pane which could be used to set default apps for certain types of files.)\nWhat makes SwiftDefaultApps the better solution, IMO, is that most of the other suggestions seem very complicated and involve a lot of scripting. SwiftDefaultApps not only gives you a GUI way of making these changes without going through the \"Get Info\" panel, but it also has a command-line tool which is much simpler than the other solutions posted so far.\nIf you download the latest release (currently SwiftDefaultApps-v2.0.1.zip) you will find a preference pane and (this is the important part) a command-line tool named swda (which stands for [sw]ift [d]efault [a]pps, of course).\nThe preference pane is a very easy GUI-based way to set your defaults without having to go through \"Get Info\" again and again, but the swda tool is what you are looking for.\nRun swda with no arguments to get a basic \"usage\" prompt:\nUtility to retrieve and manipulate default applications in macOS.\n\nAvailable commands:\n- getHandler  Returns the default application registered for the URI Scheme or <subtype> you specify..\n- getApps     Returns a list of all registered applications.\n- getSchemes  Returns a list of all known URI schemes, accompanied by their default handler.\n- getUTIs     Returns a list of all known UTIs, and their default handler.\n- setHandler  Sets <application> as the default handler for a given <type>/<subtype> combination.\n- help        Prints this help information\n- version     Prints the current version of this app\n\nUse swda foo to get more information on how to use foo such as swda setHandler.\nWith swda, I can see which kinds of files are set to use TextEdit (instead of BBEdit )\nswda getUTIs | fgrep -i textedit\nor, worse, Xcode:\nswda getUTIs | fgrep -i Xcode\nNothing worse than double-clicking a .sh file expecting it to open in BBEdit, only to see Xcode launch. \nFor example:\nswda setHandler --UTI public.shell-script --app /Applications/BBEdit.app\nresults in:\nSwiftDefaultApps SUCCESS: Default handler has succesfully changed to com.barebones.bbedit\nIt may take a little time to go through all the different settings, but I believe that swda is the easiest way to accomplish what you're looking for, and once you have things set the way that you want them, it should be easy to write a small shell script to replicate those choices on a new Mac.\n", "Q: How & why do \"0.0.0.0\" connections get a response? I have a lot of bad guys in /etc/hosts pointing to 0.0.0.0\nIf I use host to check the domain name, I get an actual IP address instead of 0.0.0.0\nWhat I expected the resolver to give me is the same thing that is in the hosts file.  What I expected from any other access is a failure (timeout).\nBut when the resolver provides the real IP, I would expect a browser to show the bad guy's website.  Instead, both Safari and Firefox show \"Blocked!!\" with the same font, font size, positioning, etc.  The HTML is identical: \n<html><body><h1>Blocked!!</h1></body></html>\nsuggesting that it comes from somewhere/something else.  Where does this HTML come from?  What would happen if the Mac tried to go there on some other (non-http/https) port?\nThis is the latest MacOS update on a 2012 MacBook.\n\nA: As I said in a comment, host is misleading because it bypasses the system resolver  (and /etc/hosts) and queries DNS directly. The 0.0.0.0 entries are probably working normally.\nFrom my tests it appears connections to 0.0.0.0 actually connect to localhost (specifically 127.0.0.1), so that <html><body><h1>Blocked!!</h1></body></html> message must be coming from a web server running on your own Mac.\nYou can confirm this by running sudo tcpdump -Aqns0 -ilo0 port 80 to watch the raw connection. Note that it'll ask for your admin password, but will not echo anything as you type. Also, you'll have to use Control-C to exit it. In the output, you'll see traffic back & forth between two different ports on 127.0.0.1 (ports 80 and whatever your browser is using), but in the request you'll see a \"Host:\" header indicating the site name the browser is trying to reach.\nSo... why is a web server running on your Mac, and why is it serving a \"Blocked!\" message? I have no idea, do you?\n", "Q: LG Ultrafine 5K always keeps my Mac charging, is this bad? The LG Ultrafine 5k Monitor is great for Apple computers. But the thing is that it will always keep your Mac charging, whether you want it or not. Is this bad for the battery life?\n\n\nA: It’s not actually charging. \nYour Mac uses the power from the charger for its power needs without going through the battery. If that power is not enough then it takes some more power from the battery. If not all power from the charger is needed and the battery is not full only then will the battery be charged. \n\nA: No. Apple manages the full charge state of all new hardware since 2017 on average (macs got it earlier and iOS a bit later). \nThe only thing that damages your MacBook class battery is lots of fast and hot (50 C) charging, or storage above 60 C. I suppose never ever discharging it might lessen the FCC but I can’t imagine you never draining it once every 6 to 9 months. \n", "Q: Can't Load Apple Hardware Test When I updated my MacBook Air (5,2, mid-2012) the installation got hung up and it started chiming as if there was a memory issue...

The steps to do this are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a bootable USB flash drive by using Disk Utility's Erase function. Make sure you choose OS X Extended for the format and the GUID Partition Map for the scheme. For the purposes of these steps, also give your USB the name AHT when you're erasing it.\n\n*Download the AHT for your particular MBA here\n\n*Mount the downloaded image (it should mount as AHTCThree)\n\n*Now you will need to copy the AHT to your USB flash drive.

You can check this by opening Contacts on your phone and tapping the Groups button (screenshot below). If you see a group called iPhone, those are stored exclusively on your phone and deleting them will not affect your Google contacts. You can uncheck the Google group to show (and ensure you only delete) contacts from your phone.

Does it mean that my battery will \"lose capacity\" over the years (months?) or that it will just uncharge faster because it's consuming more energy?\n\n\nA: Your laptop's discrete GPU (\"high-performance graphics\") uses more power than the integrated GPU. When automatic graphics switching is disabled, your computer will always use the discrete GPU, instead of switching to the integrated GPU when possible. This will make your computer use more power, so it will run for less time on battery, and thus the option will \"decrease battery life\".\nThe wording is a little ambiguous, but it isn't meant to imply any sort of lasting damage to the battery.\n\nA: The message simply means that the MacBook's battery charge won't be used in the most optimized manner and it will lose charger quicker thereby reducing battery backup (life).\nBatteries have a finite lifetime before which they start losing charge holding capacity. Thus, quicker discharge will lead to cycles getting consumed quickly thereby reducing effective lifetime. Thus the message could be indirectly inferred to mean that battery life will be reduced.\n\nA: Both, one directly from using more power, the other indirectly from deeper discharges (for the same time off AC power) and/or running hotter while plugged in and sitting at full charge.\nUsing more power will shorten the max time you can use it during one discharge starting at full, ending when the laptop powers itself off.\nIf you plug it back in before then, then saving power will mean that discharge cycle wasn't quite as deep.\n\nEvery charge/discharge cycle has a small cumulative impact on the available capacity of a Li-ion battery.  (I think that's approximately true).  The deeper the discharge, the bigger the impact.  Bouncing around multiple times between 60 and 80% is probably better for a battery than discharge from 100 to 10% and then back up to 100%.  Also sitting around at full charge, especially at high temperature, is harmful to capacity, so laptops that spend all their life plugged in can still wear out their battery.\nAlso keep in mind that the meaning of \"100%\" and \"0%\" is set by the battery controller electronics.  If a Li-ion cell ever literally discharges all the way (like with a resistor across the terminals), it can never be safely charged again: it's at high risk of catching fire if you did charge it.  So the laptop electronics shut off the laptop before that happens, making the actual \"0%\" safely far from chemically fully discharged.\nSee https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries and other things you can google for more info about modern lithium batteries, and how spurs of lithium metal can form that reduce useful capacity.  I think there can be some cases where a charge/discharge cycle can restore some life to a battery, but probably not a super-deep discharge.\n\nA: Batteries are consumable and have a finite lifetime, so you get the longest life if you can postpone the time it takes to get to 1000 full discharge and charge cycles. Most Macs will never reach that design goal in 3-4 years except if you exhaust the charge daily.  \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201585\nIf you need to always run hot, then you can probably afford $150 every 1000 cycles so it’s NBD but Apple likely wants to be sure you question the need for that setting to blaze through power at the high consumption rate with the powerful GPU engaged. \nHopefully it’s obvious you empty your tank faster from full to empty as well when you tick that option. \n", "Q: How do I know how much time battery has left on my MacBook? macOS used to show how much time your battery was good for before it died (e.g. 4 hrs and 22 mins).

Is it a good idea to have Qt at two locations? Is it a good idea to remove the one at /Library/Frameworks and keep the one brew installed?\n\nA: Often had two versions of a particular app installed (usually in the standard apps location). \nDid this with Excel - never had an issue. Also with Qt at one time.\nI just made sure the newest one was the most recent install for any libraries necessary.\n\nA: \nIs it a good idea to remove the one at /Library/Frameworks and keep the one brew installed?\n\nNo it isn't a good idea because some previously installed applications (and not standard MacOS ones) are using this library. And these applications won't be compatible with the brew version which is usually more recent and more secure than this older one, but with different interface (ex.: f(x,y) → f(x,y,z)) and behaviour.\nOn the other hand, the one installed by brew will be used to compile and  run any application installed with brew.\nIt is a very good protection that brew chosed on purpose not to overwrite the system versions of important libraries. This is a sign of a well conceived package manager, a professionnal tool.\n", "Q: Pass keyboard input to cli after exiting vim Some irritating thing when doing git commit - what I'd like to type (really fast :))\ngit commit -a --amend :wq<CR> git push -f\nMy problem is that after :wq<CR> I have to wait until vim exits... And as I have a big vimrc - it takes some time... I know, I'm spoiled...\nI'm pretty sure there is a flag to git commit that will not open vim at all, but I'd prefer a more generic vim solution that will make vim not eat my input... \n\nA: git config --global /usr/bin/ex\nshould configure git to use the non visual version of vi: ex which has\na much shorter time to switch from line to curses interface and back.\n", "Q: Correct an Apple ID Child account birthday to a teen account? Apple has different age restrictions in different regions, but most of them trigger on/off based on the age of 13.\nIf the birthday of a child account is entered incorrectly identifying the account as under 13, notable features (test flight, apple pay, and many others) on iPhone will not be available.\nIs there a way to correctly update a child's birthday, which moves them from a child account, to a teen account, and activate these features?\n\nA: After much time, I now understand more about the changing of a birthdate on a child Apple ID account.\nIn my region (US and UK) there are bands which define child, teen, and adult. They are....\n\n*\n\n*1-12 Child\n\n*13-17 Teen\n\n*18+ Adult\n\nBasically, you can't change a birthday from one band to another. Once a child, always a child, until the system thinks the birthday rolls into the next band.\nSo, once a child account is associated with a birthday under 13, it can not be changed outside the band of 0-12. But can be changed to 12 years, 364 days backwards from today.\nSo here is the fix: Change the birthday to today - 13 years + 1 day.\nExample\nToday is August 10th, 2019, so you would use August 11, 2006. Then, the next day the account will \"naturally\" roll over to 13, and at that point you can change the birthday to anything in the teen band of 13-18.\nI did have to also use the parental approval to approve the birthday change. So my steps were ...\n\n*\n\n*log into child account, change birthday.\n\n*Log out of https://appleid.apple.com\n\n*The change sends an email w/confirmation link to parent(me)\n\n*click email link to confirm birthday change\n\n*log into parent account and confirm change.\n\nMission Accomplished\n", "Q: Safari giving \"kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 303\" when visiting a site I am currently having problems visiting archive.org\nexample link\nSafari 12 (and 13 b4) on Mojave shows the following error:\nkCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 303\n\n\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*disable all extensions\n\n*Develop > Empty Caches\n\n*trashing Safari.plist\n\n*booting into Safe Mode\n\n*recovery mode + Disk Utility First Aid\n\n*different DNS servers\n\n\nAll have had no effect.\nStrangely, the problem does not appear in Safari Technology Preview, Chrome, Opera or Tor.\n\nA: OK, this solution is the strangest thing. I found the solution on a Russian site, but now that the search terms for the solution are known you can find at some other sites.\nThe problem is a result of Safari holding too much local data for the site in question and failing to deal with that correctly. I use archive.org a lot so I had lots of LocalStorage and Cookie data for that site. The fact that this data is only in Safari, and none of my other browsers explains why they could browse the site just fine.\nSo, the solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Go into Safari > Preferences > Privacy\n\n*Search for \"archive.org\" \n\n*Click Remove\n\n*The problem goes away\n\n\nHere's a video showing the problem before and after: https://imgur.com/gallery/d1P1FCi\n\nI've reported this to Apple with full logs as radar #14814758.\n", "Q: No prompt to accept files when Airdropped to myself? Ive just airdropped a file from my phone (iPhone 8, iOS 12.x) to my computer (MacBook Pro, OSX 10.13.x). Both devices use the same Apple / iCloud ID. \nThe file was received fine, but I was not required to confirm acceptance of the file on my computer. My concern is that someone could send me a file maliciously. \nMy computers AirDrop settings are set to \"Allow me to be discovered by Contacts Only.\"\nIf another contact with a different Apple ID tried to Airdrop a file to my computer, would my computer ask me to accept it ? \n\nA: According to Apple:\n\nIf you AirDrop content to yourself, like share a photo from your iPhone to your Mac, you won't see an option to Accept or Decline. The content is automatically sent to that device. Just make sure that both devices are signed in with the same Apple ID.\n\nAirDrop is working as designed.  I don't think you need to worry about someone sending you malicious content.\n\nA: Yes, your computer/ iPhone will ask to accept if another Apple ID sends something.

I've been having a problem with Security Update 2019-004 10.13.6. When it was time to restart to complete the update, the screen went black and the mouse cursor moved to the top left corner (I could still move it using the mouse). After a while it was obvious it was stuck, and the only way out was to power down using the power button.\nI've also tried installing it in Safe Mode, no luck. I also tried Internet Recovery and the problem persisted.\nWhether I try to restart or shutdown, same problem.\nSurely there's an issue with whatever program or script whose job it is to install the update. I've done quite a bit of \"googling\" and cannot find where/what it is and how to remove it so that it won't try to execute. If I can't find that, the only way to ever be able to restart/shutdown properly ever again might be a clean install, which I'd rather not do (lots of stuff configured on this iMac...)\nThe machine is a mid-2011 iMac running High Sierra.\nAny ideas?\nThanks!\n\nA: Re-installing as suggested above will fix the problem - temporarily! The next day you will end up in exactly the same situation, unless you stop all automatic updates from taking place.\nThe cause of the problem is a BUG in the 2019-004 10.13.6 High Sierra update, affecting my Mac Mini Server mid-2011, and obviously more mid-2011 machines.\nI have forwarded the info to Apple, but don't hold your breath wile waiting for a correction. Mid-2011 machines are close to extinct and all updates for those will soon, if not already (?) stop from being developed. \n", "Q: How to restore external hard drive from Time Machine backup the right way? My Time Machine backup (6 TB USB-HDD) contains the data from my Mac's internal hard drive (2 TB) and from an external hard drive (USB 4 TB, Mac OS Extended, FileVault Encrypted) that I always keep attached. \nSomehow my external 4 TB HD got corrupted and I need to reformat it. I want it Mac OS Extended, Encrypted, just as it was.\nWhat is the right way to restore all the files from my Time Machine Backup so that Time Machine sees the  hard drive as it was?\nI had a similar problem before. Restoring the root folder of the HD with Time Machine was no problem, but Time Machine recognized the new formatted hard drive as a new one, resulting in a unnecessary new full backup of the HD, filling up my backup volume.\n\nA: I found an answer over at superuser.com: https://superuser.com/a/1148703\nBut it seems there were some changes in MacOS so it did not work. But with this as a starting point I found a solution:\n\n*\n\n*Format the new drive (Or in my case the corrupted drive) with Disk Utility. Give it the same name as the old one. In my example \"Daten\"\n\n*Go to the System Preferences - Time Machine and uncheck \"Back Up Automatically\"\n\n*Go to the System Preferences - Security & Privacy. Unlock to make changes. Click on \"Full Disk Access\" and add Terminal.app from the Applications/Utilities Folder.\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Put in sudo tmutil associatedisk -a . Then first drag your new Volume to the Terminal and after that drag the folder link Latest to the Terminal. You will find this folder link on your Time Machine Volume -> Backups.backupsdb -> Your Computer Name.\nThe result should look like this:\n\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a /Volumes/Daten /Volumes/YourBackupVolume/Backups.backupdb/Your\\ Computer\\ Name/Latest\n\nAt the end of the line you need to add /Daten or whatever your failed HD was named.\n\n\n*If the final result looks like this:\n\nsudo tmutil associatedisk -a /Volumes/Daten /Volumes/YourBackupVolume/Backups.backupdb/Your\\ Computer\\ Name/Latest/Daten\n\npress Enter, enter your password and press Enter again.\n7. Open the new volume in Finder. Start Time Machine. Restore all the files.\n8. Undo step 3.\n9. Undo step 2.\nAfter that, Time Machine will see your new volume as the old one and will only backup the new files.\nThe reason why this is necessary is that Time Machine recognises the volumes not by their name but by their UUID, which is a long unique number that changes with every formatting. The associatedisk command tells Time Machine the new UUID of the volume.\n", "Q: How can I run Mojave on an iMac that won’t run Mojave? Last week a relative gave me his old iMac 27” 2011 [HDD]. I Planned to run it off a bootable external SSD with Mojave 10.14.6 installed — I wasn’t aware of the hardware limitations i.e. the iMac’s hardware only supports MacOS up to High Sierra.\nHow could I run Mojave on this iMac?\nResponders may suggest 1) patch with dosdude's patcher (not compatible with this model iMac) or 2) use High Sierra. My problem with the 2nd suggestion is that I'm already set on Mojave with software licenses (with machine install limits/hardware locks etc.) and all sorts of custom software patching setup for audio production that will be a nightmare to replicate (obviously I can't use a Mojave Time Machine BU to go backwards).\nAny ideas welcome. \n\nA: You could try http://dosdude1.com/mojave/, although I don't know if that would work in your configuration. \n", "Q: Passing alt/opt key sequence over ssh to remote host with iTerm Just learning the ropes of my new MacBook Pro.\nI have a linux workstation at the office that I use to host a number of tmux sessions, which represent whatever Im working on at a given time.\nIf out and about I will ssh into this workstation using iterm2 and tmux attach -t to any given session.\nIn tmux I have certain keys bound to certain actions, specifically, I have the movement between panes bound to Alt+[HJKL] to move in a given direction.\nI'll bet you can see the problem! Mac therefore No Alt key!\nIs there a way I can map the apple key (or some other key) to be recognised as Alt when ssh'd to this host? or even globally if its not a per host setting?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: A terminal connection, such as created by SSH, basically transfers characters, not keystrokes. There are some exceptions to this, such as the \"return\" key and CTRL+letter combinations, because they have been in use since time immemorial and have their own character codes, and some keys like the arrow keys are handled by sending multi-character sequences, but more \"modern\" inventions, such as ALT combinations (which did not exist on the 1970:s-era terminals of which modern terminal windows are the descendants) are simply not handled.\nSome terminal programs provide various work-arounds for this. One such work-around is setting the eighth bit in the character code when the ALT key is pressed, but this breaks down if you use some other character encoding than 7-bit ASCII. A more sensible workaround is to prefix \"alted\" letters with an ESC character, so that typing Alt-A is the same as typing Escape and then A.\nSo you need to figure out which of these conventions tmux expects, and then configure iTerm2 to follow that convention. I don't use iTerm2 myself, but it seems to have \"Meta\" (set eighth bit) and \"Esc+\" options under \"Keys\" in the settings window.\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro keeps disconnecting from a working wifi network. Genius can't figure it out. Any ideas? The wifi is fine. My MacBook just disconnects. As soon as I click back on the network, it immediately connects again. It is just disconnecting from the network.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have disconnected every peripheral, even my mouse and backup external HD, which honestly I need, so any solution will have to include them working. But I have tried just to see if they were involved.\n\n*I have restarted the computer and the modem, there is no router.\n\n*I have reset NVRAM/PRAM and the SMC controller multiple times.\n\n*I have created new locations for Home and School and renewed DCHP Lease for both.\n\n*My OS is updated (Mojave 10.14.6)\n\n*Again, there is nothing wrong with the wifi.

Can anyone help a guy out? \n\nA: Troubleshooting often involves a process of elimination and can require a lot of patience.\nUnfortunately, when it comes to Wi-Fi connection issues there are actually a lot of variables at play, so the best place to start would be to test for whether this is a problem with your MacBook or something specific to the Wi-Fi network. (I know you say there is nothing wrong with the Wi-Fi because others stay connected, but that doesn't actually mean it's not something to do with the Wi-Fi network).\nI also know you said there's no router, but the modem will have a built-in router so it's also possible to be something within its settings that are causing a problem.\nI would do the following:\n1. Test your MacBook on another Wi-Fi network\nThis is a simple test, and a good one to do next if you can, as all you have to do is go somewhere else and connect to Wi-Fi (e.g. a cafe, a friend's place, etc). Once connected, use the MacBook for long enough to establish if you have the same problem.\nBy doing this, we can establish very quickly whether it's an issue on the MacBook end. If you can stay connected just fine, then we know we have to investigate your usual Wi-Fi network and its environment to pinpoint the problem.\nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*If you establish your MacBook connects just fine, return to your usual Wi-Fi network and skip to option 5 below (re using Wireless Diagnostics).\n\n*If you establish it's a problem with your MacBook, or you can't test on another Wi-Fi network for a while, then proceed with the following options instead.\n\n*Of course, there is nothing stopping you from trying all options anyway, as it's also possible to be some sort of conflict between your MacBook and usual Wi-Fi network.\n\n\n2. Remove your Wi-Fi service\nYou can totally remove your Wi-Fi service, restart, and add your Wi-Fi service back.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Select the Wi-Fi service on the left-hand side\n\n*Click on the cog icon at bottom-left and select Make Service Inactive\n\n*Now delete the service by clicking on the minus sign (i.e. the - button) at left of the cog\n\n*Click on the Apply button\n\n*Exit Network preferences\n\n*Restart your MacBook\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Network\n\n*Click on the plus sign (i.e. the + button) at left of the cog\n\n*In the pop-up window, ensure that Wi-Fi is selected from the drop-down menu\n\n*Click on the Create button\n\n*Make sure Wi-Fi is on and connected (it should remember your previous settings, but if not just re-add your Wi-Fi network again)\n\n\nLet me know if this resolves the issue.\n3. Boot into Safe Mode \nIf removing the Wi-Fi service etc didn't work, let's try booting your MacBook into Safe Mode: \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MacBook \n\n*Restart your MacBook \n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you \nhave FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Test to see what happens\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your MacBook as normal \n\n*Test again to see what happens\n\n\nNote, booting into Safe Mode will take longer than usual.\n4. Test your hardware\nYou don't specify your model of MacBook, so it's not clear whether you need to use Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics to do this. If your MacBook was introduced:\n\n\n*\n\n*before June 2013, it uses Apple Hardware Test. Follow these steps.\n\n*after June 2013, it uses Apple Diagnostics. Follow these steps.\n\n\n5. Run Wireless Diagnostics\nYou can use Wireless Diagnostics to analyse your Wi-Fi network. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close any apps you have running\n\n*Connect to the Wi-Fi network\n\n*Hold down the option key and go to the Wi-Fi status menu and select Open Wireless Diagnostics\n\n*Enter your administrator name and password\n\n*Now follow the steps to see whether any problems are found.\n\n\n\nRegardless of which options you try (or whether you try all of them) let me know how you go. If the above steps don't resolve the issue, then we've still narrowed down the possibilities and can go on from there.\n\nA: For my case which it made me little disappointed because my upload file process would keep getting disconnected (the file would take 5 hours to upload but it would get disconnect after 3 hours).\nThe solution was to disable energy saving by setting it to never.\n\n\n", "Q: SSH daemon listens on both IPv4 and IPv6, but I can connect only over v6 Ok, maybe I'm weird or something, but I can't figure this one out.

Nothing. \nI feel totally stupid now :) Any suggestions are much appreciated.\n\nA: Right.. I finally figured it out.\nIt still was the damned Checkpoint Endpoint Security VPN client. Apparently it installs a kernel extension com.checkpoint.cpfw that the service com.checkpoint.epc.service controls according to organizational policy. In my case it was dropping all incoming connections. Shutting down service doesn't flush the rules enforced by the kernel extension. \nUnloading the kernel extension helped.\n", "Q: New iPhone XS People & Places People album not populating - nothing I have a new iPhone Xs running iOS 12.4 syncing to MBP using Mojave 10.14.6 via iTunes version 12.9.5.5. Using usb cord to sync selected items - pics, music, etc..  \nThe People album under People & Places will not populate.  Can anyone help to get it working?  Not sure what to do.

It changed after I took these 2 screen shots to post....  Weird.\n  \n\nA: Photos synced through iTunes won't carry over faces data. Instead, your phone will scan the library manually. It will do this in such a fashion that it doesn't interfere with your battery life.\nIf you haven't left it plugged in over night you certainly won't see much results\n", "Q: How to fix Dictionary look up text color in Dark mode? In macOS Mojave dark mode, the Dictionary app became unusable because of coloring issues: in application itself some of the text is white on white, and in definition popup that appears if you right click a word and select Look Up (or use force touch or three-finger press) the text is black on a dark grey background: \n\nHow can it be fixed?\n\nA: After searching the Internet and experimenting I was able to produce a solution. You have to create a DefaultStyle.css file and put it in Contents subdirectory for each dictionary you want to fix. The dictionaries are located at ~/Library/Dictionaries or at /System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/ folders. You can easily open them in Finder by pressing Cmd+Shift+G and pasting the folder path. Here's the DefaultStyle.css contents:\n@charset \"UTF-8\";\n@namespace d url(http://www.apple.com/DTDs/DictionaryService-1.0.rng);\n\n\n@media (prefers-dark-interface)\n{\n\n    html {\n        -apple-color-filter: apple-invert-lightness();\n    }\n\n    a {\n        -apple-color-filter: none;\n        color: -webkit-link;\n    }\n\n    img {\n        filter: invert(100%);\n    }\n\n    html.apple_client-panel body div {\n        color: text;\n    }\n\n    html.apple_client-panel body div.L1 {\n        color: -apple-system-label;\n    }\n\n}\n\nIt uses @media (prefers-dark-interface) selector to apply this CSS only in dark mode. The html.apple_client-panel is the selector for a popup window that appears when you use the Define/Look Up feature. After applying the fix the Dictionary looks good and is readable again:\n\n", "Q: Recover from possible infection by virus attachment via email I clicked on an attachment of a scam email by mistake and the file was downloaded to the download folder. I did not open it, but I feel that this was probably enough to infect my laptop.  The format was filename.z. the content was about an invoice that I was actually waiting for. So I quickly clicked on it without much thought. Then I read the mail which was spam.\nI am using MacBook Pro 2017 running 10.14.6. I have never installed any anti-virus or anti-malware software.\nAre there any recommended steps I should take? I deleted the file from the download file and permanently from trash. But other than that I do not know what the best course of action is.\n\nA: GENERALLY speaking just downloading a file or saving it to your hard drive will not infect your Mac. Generally.\nWhat you have done after inadvertently saving the file is trashing it and then emptying the trash, which is exactly what you should have done. While it is possible that whatever you downloaded infected your Mac, I would say the odds are pretty low.\nThere are a number of free or inexpensive malware scanners available for macOS. Malwarebytes and AVG spring to mind, but there are others and perhaps others that do a better job. Wander over to macworld.com (or just search on AV software for Mac) and see what they say about Mac AV software. Then download and use the one that looks good to you.\n", "Q: How to file-manage an iPhone from a Windows box? I am considering buying an iPhone, probably an XR, XS, or X.\nIs it possible to file-manage such a device from a laptop that is running Windows 7 Pro and is connected to the iPhone by USB cable, and if so how can I do this?\nThe kind of file management tasks I have in mind are straightforward ones such as copying files to and fro, editing text files (which comes down to being able to open and save from the Windows machine), renaming and deleting files and directories, creating new directories, and moving files and directories about. Is this just as easy to do as if the laptop were connected by USB cable to say a flash drive rather than to the smartphone? Or is it perhaps impossible because there is no way of making an iPhone running iOS show up on a Windows box as a drive in the first place?\n(Note: I have no need to sync; this question concerns file management only.)\n\nA: Generally speaking you can't do this on a PC (Linux or Windows) or a Mac. Though on Windows PCs you can usually get to the folder that holds music and pictures, if I remember correctly.\nBut really there is no way to treat an iPhone like a thumb drive without jailbreaking it or jumping through hoops that would end up (possibly) being more trouble than it is worth.\nThe only thing you should do is back up the phone to your PC from time to time. Yes you can use iCloud backup, which I do use, but I also change that button in iTunes and back up locally from time to time. Mostly because I am a vaguely paranoid IT guy who has seen so many people lose data because of incomplete backups that I have two backup methods for my iPhone.\n", "Q: Cannot erase ~500GB from startup disk tldr: how do I erase all of the information from my startup disk? Logging into recovery mode and selecting \"erase\" has no affect on my disk's \"free\" space.\nWhile attempting to diagnose an issue I was experiencing, I decided to erase my iMac's startup disk and then restore from a time machine backup. So I log into recovery mode, open up disk utility, and select \"erase\". Somewhat surprisingly, I see that, while the disk's \"used\" space drops to almost zero, all of the data seems to be transferred to the \"other volumes\" category, and the amount of \"free\" space on the disk doesn't change.\nI assumed that this was simply a labeling issue, and that the operating system had earmarked all of this \"other volumes\" information to be deleted asap. So I opened up time machine and restored from backup. After having completed the time machine restore, I logged into find that all of that \"other volumes\" data was still taking up hundreds of gigabytes of space, and I had only ~20GB free on the computer.\nSo I try logging into recovery mode again and selecting \"erase.\" This time it does free up all the \"used\" space, but it still leaves ~500GB of \"other volumes\" data.\nSo how do I actually erase all of the information on my startup disk? Logging into recovery mode and selecting \"erase\" seems to have no affect. Thanks!!\n\nA: This will clear all the data on your drive!\nYou can erase the whole volume by clicking the View button and choosing Show All Devices. Then select the top-level entry and click Erase. Set it to APFS and GUID and click Erase. Name it Macintosh HD (or whatever you prefer if that's not your preference). Then run the installer on your new Macintosh HD and you'll get a clean install with no data.\n\nA: Ah HA! Well it took about 24 hours to figure out, but the solution is to: \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into recovery mode\n\n*Open disk utility\n\n*Select the internal drive in the side bar\n\n*Find the \"+/-\" volume button in the toolbar and select the \"-\" volume option.\n\n*The appearance of the internal drive will change in the sidebar. Select the root (top level) of the drive in the sidebar and reformat the drive (I'm afraid I don't quite remember which button allows you to reformat the drive, but I remember it being somewhat obvious).\n\n*This time the options presented to you allow you to choose the file system as well as the partition scheme, when you reformat the drive everything is successfully erased.\n\n", "Q: Can I backup my ICloud documents with TimeMachine to my TimeCapsule? I want my docs en pics in the cloud but also a backup. Want to backup to a TimeCapsule with TimeMachine (or if necessairy an other softwareprogram). Wonder if that’s possible.\n\nA: This is possible (requiring no interaction), however you need to make sure that \"Optimize Mac Storage\" is not enabled and that all your files are downloaded. If they're not downloaded, they won't get backed up.\n", "Q: How to repair Mactintosh HDD I have a MacBook Pro 2016 15\" with 256GB running macOS High Sierra. When I got the MacBook used, I was able to log in. The MacBook did not have an iCloud account linked so I linked mine up and enabled Find my Mac. \nI tried to do a fresh install of macOS Sierra which cleaned out the hard drive but it says \"An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again\". \nDisk Utility returns a code 8 for a corrupted system. Is this because I did not turn off the Find my Mac? \n\nA: If your goal is to install macOS Sierra, then your best bet is to boot into macOS Recovery using the ShiftOption⌘R keyboard shortcut. That's because your model MBP originally shipped with macOS Sierra and this keyboard shortcut is designed to install the version of macOS that originally shipped with your Mac.* \nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Power up your MBP again but immediately press and hold the ShiftOption⌘R\n\n*Keep the keys down until you see either an Apple logo or spinning globe appear on screen (Note: If you have a firmware password set on your system, then let go of the keys when the password prompt appears)\n\n*Once the Utilities window appears you'll be in macOS Recovery Mode\n\n\nNow choose to reinstall macOS and follow the prompts.\nIMPORTANT - If you already have data stored on your internal drive you should do a backup first!\n* For users of older Mac models this option will install the closest version of macOS still available to the original that shipped with it.\n", "Q: What happens if I delete an icloud backup? Ok so, I currently have filled up 2 tb of icloud storage. If I delete an iphone’s backup from icloud, will that also delete all the data that is stored in icloud for that iphone?

If I delete the backup from icloud to make more space for a new backup will I still have all my data on my iphone?\n\nA: A backup is just a copy of data on your iPhone, yes. However some types of data on your phone are not stored in iCloud Backup, but rather in other parts of iCloud or similar services. This includes for example photos in iCloud Photos, files in iCloud Drive, and Contacts, Calendars, Bookmarks, Mail, Notes, Health Data and Voice Memos in iCloud.\nDeleting a backup from iCloud will not delete the data on your iPhone.\nIf you delete all the backups of your phone, you'll only have the data on your phone.

(I am talking about folders in the Mail GUI at this point, not operating system folders/directories on a drive.)\nSometimes a folder just disappears, and what's happened is that it's become a subfolder of some other folder.  (It's possible that I do this by accident with uncautious use of the mouse, but I don't think that's it.  I think Mail just gets confused and does stupid things sometimes.)\nI know that the folder and its messages still exist, because if I open the message search box, I can find messages, and they are listed as being in a folder with that name.  I want to drag the folder back to where it belongs, but sometimes I can't find out where that folder is.  Since I have so many folders and subfolders, poking through every folder in Mail to find out where Mail decided to move the folder in question is time consuming.\nIs there any way to find a folder, by its name, for example, in the Mail folder hierarchy?\nEven if there's no tool in Mail to do this, maybe there's a kludgey way to do it by searching through Mail's data files on disk using ls, grep, Unix find, etc.  Maybe there's some graphical utility that I don't know about that will help.\nThanks.\n\nA: If you want to search in Finder for the same, and then do the equivalent in Mail, you should go to /Users/you/Library/Mail/V* * varies for MacOS. Do either of these 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the question, you mentioned that you can search for specific messages inside mail app. So just pick a rare keyword from one of them and search for the same string in the directory. Press CMD + up to reach its parent folders and then open Mail app and navigate to that folder and fix it.\n\n*Since you know the folder name of the misplaced, search for name.mbox and it will give you that folder itself.\n\n\nAnother possibly easy method can be to select a mail, right click, \"Move To\"-> you should see a lot of folders. I just hope that they're expanded. If you move something by mistake, CMD + Z brings it back. \n", "Q: Is there any reliable, repeatable way to find a folder on MacOS? I have a folder full of Logic projects on my local drive. Finder offers no way to get to it. It's a constant frustration. I can get to iCloud, Downloads, Applications -- but not my own files on my own disk drive. \nI understand that Apple has strict usability standards, and I respect that, but is there any way to work around them and conveniently access my own files only own computer, other than a keyboard shortcut that I'll forget and have to Google every time? (It doesn't work anyway -- the first time I tried, there was no folder named \"Logic\" in whatever unknowable scope it's searching in; the second time I told it to open \"Logic\", it opened Downloads. I can take a joke as well as the next guy, but sometimes I just want to get to my files). \nIs it possible to create a link to a folder on the desktop, or something functionally similar? Something I can easily find when I want it, and click on it? \nTo clarify: I'm coming at this from a Windows/UNIX based expectation that all the folders are in a unified tree that's rooted somewhere, and you use one application (bash, DOS prompt, Windows Explorer, whatever) to navigate that whole tree: Some branches of the tree are on the local disk and \"real\", others are \"virtual\", but they all have a chain of parents starting at the same root. \nBut I'm starting to think I may need to learn a different way of thinking about this stuff in order to use MacOS. \nThe actual problem I have here is: I shared three Logic projects via iCloud with a pianist. We recorded many takes of his parts at his apartment. Then I needed to copy the projects from iCloud back to my local disk. \"Open three projects in Logic and Save As for each one\" is a very slow and awkward way to copy three files from one folder to another (or archive, or whatever a \"single file\" Logic project actually is). \n\nA: *\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH13433?locale=en_US explains better about file save location for the app. If you're doubtful, open Logic, try to Save a new project and remember the location.\n\n*Replying to your: \"whatever unknowable scope it's searching in\", there are two places where it is written that \"This Mac\" is being searched. So see there to find the scope.\n\n\n\n*You can add the folder Logic(if and when you find it) to the sidebar by dragging the folder to the Favourites. \n\n*You can go to Finder Preferences and set the folder under General -> \"New Finder window shows\" as your folder Logic. But you'd have to open a new window for that, so remember that shortcut as per File Menu in Finder.\n\nA: \nIs it possible to create a link to a folder on the desktop, or something functionally similar? Something I can easily find when I want it, and click on it?\n\nYes.  There are a couple of options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop Folder:  Find any folder that you'd like to have directly accessible on the Desktop.  Right-click the folder icon to open the pop-up menu.  Pick Make Alias.  Drag the Alias to the Desktop.  (You can also rename the Alias if you want).\n\n*Sidebar Folder:  Open a Finder window.  Make sure you have the sidebar displayed (if not, navigate to View->Show Sidebar).  Locate the folder you want to have directly accessible.  Drag the folder to the Favorites section of the Sidebar.  (To remove an item from the Favorites list you can just drag it off the Finder window and release.)\n\nA: By default, Logic saves projects to <user>/Music/Logic. (where <user> is the name of your user domain.)\nIn the Finder, you can navigate to that folder by:  \n\n\n*\n\n*open a new window (Command N). If that doesn't show your User Home,\ntype Command Shift H (or Go > Home from the menubar).   \n\n*You should then see the Music folder, which you can select, and then click on the Logic subfolder.\n\n\nYou should also be able to search for logic files with Spotlight. Click on the Magnifying Glass icon in the top right of the menubar (or use Command Space), and type in the name of one your files. Or try typing kind:logic to get your most recent files. Click on \"Show All in Finder\".  \nUsing the Search field in a Finder window is exactly the same as using Spotlight, except that it may limit the scope to the current folder, or the entire computer, either of which may not be useful. So make sure you're at your Home folder first.\nThe Finder should not really be any different from Windows Explorer or any other Unix/Linux file navigator. You may prefer to use Column View or List View, which will show the hierarchy more clearly. You can also click on the filepath in the titlebar to reveal a drop-down list of the filepath.\nIn Finder Preferences, you can set what location appears for a new window. This can be your Home folder, or the root of the boot volume ('Macintosh HD'), or the device itself ('Ed's MacBook Pro'), under which, the drives and network folders will sit.\nApple's guide to using the Finder is here.\nLogic should also be able to open the most recent projects directly by name from the Open Recent menu item.\n", "Q: What input voltages does the 85W Magsafe 2 power adapter accept? I have an 85W Magsafe 2 (A1242, MD506LL) power adapter which has been happily driving my MacBook Pro from US and Canadian 110V AC power. I am about to take this power adapter to Europe. Will I be able to plug this adapter into a plug adapter (from North American type B socket to Europlug type C plug), which passes through mains voltage and frequency unchanged, and plug that into normal outlets in Italy, Austria, Croatia, and the UK (type G plug for the UK of course) and have it operate correctly?\nWhat input voltages and frequencies does the 85W Magsafe 2 power adapter accept?\nI have been unable to find definitive specs on the adapter itself or on Apple's website. I would hope the answer is \"110-240V 50/60Hz\", as it is for my cheap USB power bricks, but I'm not going to plug in my expensive MacBook Pro based on hope. I'd appreciate pointers to definitive information.\n\nA: \"Input: 100-240V~ 1.5A 50-60 Hz Output:20V [DC] 4.25A max\"\nThe answer is in fact on the side of the adapter. There is text on the plug end and on one of the narrow sides of the adapter.

With a light and a magnifier, my old eyes were finally able to make it out.\n\"[DC]\" refers to a symbol with a solid line next to a dashed line, meaning \"direct current\".\n", "Q: My brand new MacBook Book Pro dies at 30% with no warning I got my MBP earlier today and when I'm using it it works just fine but when it dies it gives me no warning and it dies around 30%, I don't know how to fix this issue as it's supposed to have a 10 hour battery life but when I charge to maybe 60 or 70 it just dies at 30 in an hour and a half or two, and when I charge it it begins at around 30-40, what does this mean and is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: Firstly, how long your MacBook Pro will last on a charge will depend on a number of factors, including what you're using it for at the time. Most people most of the time will not achieve 10hrs in between charges. Sometimes you will, and sometimes you'll even exceed 10hrs, but usually you'll fall short of that.\nHowever, it also shouldn't just die at 30%, so I would reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\nResetting the SMC on a MacBook Pro (2018 or 2019 models)\nNOTE: If your MBP is not a 2018 or 2019 model with the T2 chip, please let me know so these steps can be amended.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP. \n\n*Press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go of the power button and wait 5 seconds\n\n*Power up your MBP again\n\n\nOnce you've reset the SMC fully charge your MBP and see how you go. If it's still misbehaving, reset the SMC again but with the following steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP. \n\n*Press and hold the right shift key and the left option and control keys for 7 seconds before then also pressing and holding the power button (or Touch ID button) down for another 7 seconds (i.e. the keys will end up being held down for 14 seconds, the power button for 7 seconds)\n\n*Let go of all three keys and the power button\n\n*Wait 5 seconds\n\n*Power up your MBP again\n\n\nNow test your MBP again.\n\nA: If you experience any hardware problems with a brand new Mac, take it back to the shop for repair, replacement or refund.\n", "Q: Water spilled into the keyboard of my Macbook - would this affect the quality of the files saved on it? Water spilled into the keyboard of my MacBook Pro. It still works the way it used to, but the pictures saved on the computer seem to have gotten pixelated. How could I recover the original quality of those photos?\n\nA: It's highly unlikely that spilt water on your keyboard will result in your photos becoming pixelated. Instead, it's much more likely that spilt water will damage some of the components of your MBP (depending on what you did immediately after the spill and how long it's been since). \nIf your internal drive was damaged, then you'd have all sorts of problems reading from and writing to the drive, which means it wouldn't still work the way it used to (as per your question).\nAs a test I would copy some of these photos onto a USB drive and try viewing them on another computer just to see if they still look pixelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*If they do, then you know your data has been corrupted. \n\n*If they don't, then you know you've most likely got another problem with your MBP (e.g. damage to the graphics card, damage to the screen, etc).\n\n\nIf you don't have access to another computer, then email the photos to your smartphone and view them on that.\nAs an additional step it would be worth testing your hardware.\nTesting your hardware\nYou don't specify your model of MacBook Pro, so it's not clear whether you need to use Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics to do this. If your MacBook Pro was introduced:\n\n\n*\n\n*before June 2013, it uses Apple Hardware Test. Follow these steps.\n\n*after June 2013, it uses Apple Diagnostics. Follow these steps.\n\n", "Q: \"Install Spotify\" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software I'm running macOS 10.15 Catalina Beta.\nWhen I try to install Spotify I see the following error:\n\nIs this a Spotify issue or a Catalina issue?\nThanks.\n\nA: *\n\n*for older version of macOS\n\nSystem Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> check Allow Anywhere \n\n\n\n*\n\n*for macOS Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave\n$ sudo spctl --master-disable\n\nBut if the Move To Trash issue still exists. This is because Apple has removed TNT certification. You may use codesign to resign it:\n$ codesign --sign - --force --deep <app-path>\n\n\n\n*\n\n*for macOS Catalina\nI think codesign sometimes doesn't work for the notarization issue recently, so you should use xattr to remove the quarantine:\n$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <app-path>\n\nI have got a conclusion. When installing app from 3rd party on different macOS, you can try different ways when it comes up to Move to Trash issue. Meanwhile, I think this is a common issue for 3rd party apps, so you may change the title question to something that contains Cannot be opened or Move to trash as well.\n\nA: Catalina requires all apps that are signed with developer IDs to be 'notarized' by Apple. \nIn the absence of an updated version from the developer, you can try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click and select \"Open\". This may bring up the same dialog, but with an option to Open the file anyway.\n\n*You can get round this by removing the quarantine Extended Attribute on the file:\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/file\nNaturally, this bypasses Apple's security precautions which exist to stop maliciously altered software from running.\n\nA: This is a notarization issue with Spotify on Catalina. Although you can right-click to open, you should be extremely cautious with that! That bypasses the mechanisms macOS is using to try to protect you from malware.\nIf you use this method to open something that you know, with 100% certainty, is actually from Spotify, that is a temporary workaround. But the failing here is that Spotify didn't get their software notarized despite knowing since at least June that it would be a requirement for Catalina. Please let Spotify know that you are dissatisfied with this level of carelessness, and do the same with any other vendor whose Mac software is not yet notarized.\n\nA: I was facing the same issue while I was trying to install .Net Core 2.2 SDK. \n\ndotnet-sdk-2.2.207-osx-x64 (1).pkg” can’t be opened because Apple\n  cannot check it for malicious software.\n\nAnd as mentioned in this forum entry all I had to do was to press the CTRL key while the installation was going on. I am not a Mac fan and that was the first time I was using the same, so I am not sure what happened when I was pressing CTRL key. Sharing this info for people who needs a quick resolution to this problem.\n\nA: You can fix this problem by right-clicking on that .dmg or .pak file and choose open.\nHere is the video to fix that type problem:\nhttps://youtu.be/6Cjpo3uKHLw\n\nA: After unzipping the mac sqldeveloper.zip file, you will find the SQLDeveloper.app file.\nCopy the SQLDeveloper.app to Applications folder.

The iPhone needs to be cool down before you can use the flash\"\nShe tried the \"erase all content and settings\" but it is useless. \nHelp is appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: The message is self explanatory. The iPhone needs to be taken to a cool and dry place. Erase all content did worse I think. It should have been left turned off for a while in a cool and ventilated place.\n\nUse iOS devices where the ambient temperature is between 0º and 35º C (32º to 95º F). \n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201678\n\nTo resume use of your device as quickly as possible, turn it off, move it to a cooler environment, and allow it to cool down.\n\nIf turn off isn't an option, I would reduce all operations, airplane mode on, low power mode on, closing all apps etc. \n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2010 crashes after waking up and usually when launching a Google Search in Chrome I've got issues with my MBP which seem to be persistent, even after replacing the logic board for supposedly one without hardware issues.

panic report that this is a mid-2010 15\" MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, this model was prone to having problems with its dedicated graphics card and while Apple did have an extended repair program for this model, that extra coverage has now ended.\nHowever, there are a few things you can do to minimise the problem.\ngfxCardStatus\nMany users have found that using gfxCardStatus will reduce these issues most of the time. My experience with many users is that versions 1.8.1 and 2.1 seem to be the best for your particular model MBP, even though more recent versions fixed a number of bugs.\nSo, I’d like you to give version 1.8.1 a go for a while and see how you go. If you’re not happy with that, then try version 2.1 instead.\nNOTE: Unfortunately, there were two distinct issues that affected your particular model of MBP. gfxCardStatus was designed to address a hardware problem that occurs on a number of models, including yours. However, your model was also prone to being affected by a software issue that was unique to your model. If your model is affected by that as well, then version 2.3 may be a better choice.  So, in summary, I would start with 1.8.1 and see how you go. If you’re not happy, then try 2.1. Then go to 2.3 if you're still not satisfied. Do not try any other versions for your model MBP!\nGoogle Chrome\nI actually wouldn't use Google Chrome on this machine, but if you really need to then there’s actually a setting in Google Chrome that may help you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Chrome > Preferences\n\n*Scroll down to the bottom\n\n*Click on Advanced\n\n*Scroll down to the System heading\n\n*Disable the Use hardware acceleration when available option\n\n\nmacOS\nThere are a couple of things you can do within macOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*You’re probably already aware of this one – but for your MBP you should have an additional setting under System Preferences > Energy Saver for Automatic graphics switching. Playing with this and the other Graphics option (for better battery life) may be useful.\n\n*Now this one is not so obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Click on Accessibility\n\n*Select Display (in the left-hand column)\n\n*On the right-hand side, tick the Reduce transparency and Reduce motion boxes.\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n\n\nBasically, to draw/display transparency and show motion in the GUI (windows etc), it needs a lot of graphics power. Not a good idea for your MBP I’m afraid.\n", "Q: Is it possible to execute the package (located in FTP) from terminal of Mac I have a scenario where I don't want to allow end-user to download the file but I want for them to install the required tool on their Mac machine using the package of FTP.

While googling, I saw the option of wget but I am still researching to know whether it is doable or not. \nKindly share me your opinion on it. \n\nA: Shell script: curl & installer\nIf you can host the package on a web site, the installation can be reduced to the following two commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the file to the local computer:\n/usr/bin/curl https://www.example.com/mypackage.pkg > /tmp/mypackage.pkg\n\n\n*Install the downloaded file:\n/usr/sbin/installer -pkg /tmp/mypackage.pkg -target /\n\nYou can combine these commands in a text file called install-mypackage.command:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/curl https://www.example.com/mypackage.pkg > /tmp/mypackage.pkg\n/usr/sbin/installer -pkg /tmp/mypackage.pkg -target /\n/bin/rm /tmp/mypackage.pkg\n\nWhen the .command file is opened by the user, the package will be downloaded and installed.\nThis approach assumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The software is distributed as a flat .pkg file.\n\n*You can host the package somewhere privately.\n\n\nUsing sftp instead of curl\nIf your files are hosted on a Secure File Transfer Protocol (sftp) server, use the sftp client. To script the client, use a batch file or follow answers to Single Line sftp from Terminal.\nImprovements\nPlease note this script has no error checking. Consider this script a starting point for your own script.\nYou could add a password to your web site and then use a URL with the credentials embedded, such as https://username:password@www.example.com/mypackage.pkg.\nGiven you have ssh access to the computers, you could run this script or commands remotely.\n", "Q: WhatsApp calls on an iPhone and \"data\" and \"minutes\" Am I right that if I use my iPhone (which I have not yet bought) to make a WhatsApp to WhatsApp call then the position is as follows?\n\n\n*\n\n*If I am using wifi, this activity does not incur charges (because whatever is done through wifi does not count as either \"data\" or \"minutes\"?), but\n\n*if I am using the cellphone network, this activity will count under \"mobile data\" or \"data allowance\" (or perhaps \"minutes\"?), and therefore it will incur charges, being paid for out of either \"data\" or \"minutes\" or perhaps both?\nPlease assume that I have a PAYG arrangement that allows a specified amount of \"data\" and number of \"minutes\".\nI have not used a smartphone before, and although I have read a few pages the exact meaning of \"data\" and \"minutes\" as these terms are currently used remains somewhat opaque to me. Thus \"minutes\" seems to refer only to voice calls placed to a phone number through the cellphone network.  But if the call is made from WhatsApp to WhatsApp then it is still a voice call (and also a video call) made to a phone number, even it obviously goes through the internet (and requires a continuing transfer of digital data). As for the actual connection required for a WhatsApp call, it may be made through wifi or it may be made through the cellphone network. If it goes through the cellphone network, does that make it count as \"data\" rather than \"minutes\". As I understand it, even a short video can amount to a lot of data.\nWhere is it documented what is considered data on iPhone for cellular carriers?\n\nA: Usually carriers distinguish\n\n\n*\n\n*minutes: for voice calls using the standard phone app, to either other phones or landlines (which can be confusing since FaceTime calls and audio use data and not voice minutes)\n\n*sms (which can be confusing since the the message app uses data for iMessage and SMS for MMS and SMS)\n\n*data: for all other internet traffic generated by any app that doesn’t hand off to SMS or the phone app. \n\n\nWhatsApp uses data for both messages and calls. If you are in a mobile network, any activity you do in that app counts towards your data usage. If you are logged in to a WiFi network, data will be send/received over WiFi.\nContact your carrier for details how you ar set up so you can reconcile your bill and plan with how data usage on iOS records usage. \n\nA: Mobile carriers provide two basic services: mobile voice service and data transmission.  Mobile voice service is provided by a wireless connection to the carriers towers, and supported by the Mobile Switched Network on the carrier side, that connects to the Public Switched Telephone Network (ie. telephone service).  SMS is part of this voice standard, and allows short messages be sent over the phone network, and was very popular before the rise of smart phones and fast data connections.\nYour mobile phone, whether smart or not, as chips and radios that support these frequencies, connecting voice calls and other voice services. \nThe mobile carrier also provides data services, which are designed to carry network traffic like the internet. You have heard of things like '3G\" \"4G\" \"LTE\" \"5G\" which refer to these faster and faster data connections. (Confusingly, some of these encompass voice and data, but let's keep is simple and just consider these 'data' connections for now). These can use a different set of signals and radios than the voice service mentioned earlier. Smart phones support both voice and data connections, though some older phones support only voice.  \nSo, the best way to think of this that an old-school phone call uses the phone network, which counts as 'minutes' and every other application uses the data network, and counts that in gigabytes (GB).  Therefore Whatsapp, which is an app, uses data or Gigabytes,  not minutes.\nOK, now, lets try to not get confused: lets say you have NO APPS on your brand new phone. You give your Mom or Dad your new phone number, and they call you. That app, the one that rings when they call, is what counts as minutes. EVERYTHING ELSE on your phone, counts as data or gigabytes.\nYes, you can make a voice 'call' over Whatsapp, or Facetime, or lots of other apps. But they are using the Gigabytes to send a voicecall over the data network.  They don't count against your minutes, because they are not using the voice network. Its best to think of this by app: there is one app on your smartphone that counts minutes, and that is the phone app. Everything else counts gigabytes (data). \nWifi is using a different network to support the data side of your phone: when you are on Wifi, your phone is connected to the local Wifi router, NOT the carrier data network. Therefore, because your phone is using Wifi, rather than the carrier's data network, you don't have gigabyte charges. But, because Wifi only replaces the data connection with your carrier, the voice radios in your phone DO connect to the carrier. So regular phone calls, on the phone app, continue to work, as does Whatsapp. Only Whatsapp is using Wifi now, not the carrier data.\n\nA: *\n\n*Wi-Fi: The owner of Wi-Fi has to pay. Just to be sure, turn off Data.\n\n*Cellular/ Mobile Data on: It counts against the allocated bandwidth or simply provided data in a pack. Like 1 GB for some money etc. \n\n*Minutes are counted when the phones behave as internet-less devices and this is paid separately. \nA simple analogy would be to see the icons in the top bar. The one similar to 5 dots or 4-5 bars is what you see as minutes. The one besides that with 3G, 4G, LTE or E etc is what determines cost and quality of WhatsApp calls. Same for the Wi-Fi icon. \nOne can have all three things separate and exclusive of each other. You're on the right track. \n", "Q: Command Line for Final Cut Pro Import? Is there a command that I can use for importation of files into Final Cut Pro?  I tried this next command but Command-O is not the way to import files.  \nopen -g -a \"/Applications/Final Cut Pro.app\" /Volumes/D2/converted/20190811_000009_14E7_00408CFA958C.mp4\n\nIs there a way to do this?  I need to automate importation of many files at 1am.  \n\nA: I'm one of the creators behind CommandPost.\nCommandPost is a free and open source Mac application that allows you to seriously speed up your creative editing process through powerful and customisable automation tools. Think Apple’s Automator, with a little bit of BetterTouchTool and Keyboard Maestro thrown in, but specifically designed for creative professionals. It's a fork of Hammerspoon - and everything is scripted in Lua.\nThe way we get files into Final Cut Pro using our watch folder functionality is via the Pasteboard. We copy the file path to the pasteboard, then trigger a Paste operation in Final Cut Pro. Here's a link to the specific code:\nhttps://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/src/plugins/finalcutpro/watchfolders/media/MediaFolder.lua#L710\nYou can control CommandPost via Lua-based plugins, AppleScript, URL and Terminal commands - so you could definitely work out a way to do this at a specific time rather than via Watch Folders.\nWe have a fairly active Facebook Group, and you're also more than welcome to contact us via the details on the CommandPost site.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: You might want to check out CommandPost which has a Watch Folders function. I've never used this software, so I'm not sure of its full capabilities. It may be a good place to start.\nDisclaimer: I have no financial or personal ties to CommandPost.io.\n", "Q: How do I change the password on an AD-bound Mac to match what's already in AD? My Mac at work is bound to our Active Directory domain. It's managed with JAMF, and I have NoMAD installed.\nThe last time I came due for a password change (every sixty days), an unknown issue prevented me from executing the change from my Mac. Our IT folks couldn't figure out the issue, so I was forced to do my AD password change from a Windows PC elsewhere on the network. This left my Mac's login password, as well as my Keychain and Filevault passwords, the same as before.\nAs I understand it, NoMAD was supposed to detect that they were out of sync and automatically fix it for me, but that hasn't happened. I have not been able to determine why.\nOur IT folks are Windows guys. One of them knows the Mac reasonably well, but he's not an expert in this area and he's stumped.\nThis was all 56 days ago, so I'm about due to change my password again. I tried to do it in System Preferences -> Users & Groups, which is my normal method, but it fails with the same mysterious error I got last time -- it says the server is not available.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the server is available. But this isn't the point.\nWhen that failed, I tried changing with NoMAD, but I can't. The error message is the generic \"local password doesn't meet policy requirements\", and I assume it's because my local password isn't the same as the one in AD, so when it tries to confirm my old password, it can only succeed for one of the two backing systems. I've tried both old passwords; same error.\nSo, my question: What, if anything, can I do to update my Mac's local, keychain, and Filevault passwords that will not try to update AD?\nThings I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Users & Groups sysprefpane, as described above\n\n*Changing with NoMAD, as described above\n\n*Using passwd at the terminal. Same results for both old passwords:\n% ~ passwd\nChanging password for jrobb.\nOld Password:\nNew Password:\nRetype New Password:\npasswd: general failure\n\n\n*Repeat #1 while disconnected from the network. Same \"server is not available\" message -- and this time I believe it!\n\n*Repeat #2 while disconnected from the network. Same \"local password doesn't meet policy requirements\" as before.\n\n\nIf it matters, I'm running 10.14.6. \nUPDATE: After unbinding and re-binding my Mac to the AD domain, my Mac's password was sync'd up with AD. But then I encountered the same \"server is not available\" error when trying to change the password from Users & Groups, forcing me to use another method to update my AD password, and now they're out of sync again. \n\nA: As I understand it, the correct way to change domain passwords should be kpasswd, which should update both local computer and domain passwords.\nNote that I'm not in a position to test this right now, but something like:\n> kpasswd myusername@FULLADDOMAIN.COM\nmyusername@FULLADDOMAIN.COM's Password: \nNew password for myusername@FULLADDOMAIN.COM: \nVerify password - New password for myusername@FULLADDOMAIN.COM: \nSuccess\n\nI'll try and test this out and update this post.\n", "Q: Will rsync copy extended attributes, ACLs, etc. reliably enough for Time Machine? I am copying a TM backup to a new drive over USB by drag&drop per Apple’s recommendation.  But since it is more than two terabytes, I am concerned about the risk of interruption.\nIf I try to resume with rsync -avAX will Time Machine be able to continue using it?  Another question/answer suggests I might have to ensure I have the latest rsync but will that be enough?\n\nA: Rsync, with the -E option, will copy the extended attributes and ACL of a file. The man page for rsync states:\n\n\n-E, --extended-attributes   copy extended attributes, resource forks\n-E, --extended-attributes\n                  Apple-specific option to copy extended attributes,\n                  resource forks, and ACLs.  Requires at least Mac OS X 10.4\n                  or suitably patched rsync.\n\n\n\nA: Well, in OS 10.14.6 the answer is NO, but not due to a flaw in rsync.  Somebody bumped the USB cable when it was one-third done (estimating twelve hours to go).\nI tried \"rsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31\" installed/updated today by brew\nWhen that failed, I installed another with Macports.

Not permitted, even with sudo.  And sudo chmod -RN fails to remove the ACLs.  So, it must be SIP protected.\nUpdate: as seen in comments, this error does not happen to everyone.  I do not know why.  I do know that before SIP, I occasionally had to relax permission restrictions on a backup set to get around a Time Machine bug.  But Time Machine always tightened them back up on the next backup.  Now, SIP won’t let me do that, but apparently at least one person does not have those restrictions.\n", "Q: iPhone: How do I change the default start time of an event? Often I find myself finishing a meeting and setting up one the following week, same time same place.  Apple is pretty good about suggesting the place and even autocompleteing the title, but the time is almost always very close to the current time, NOT the time of event I am copying.\nIs there any way to make this a little more \"dumb\" and just grab the previous event's time instead of assuming that I want the current time?  This would also make it much easier to paste events that repeat irregularly.\n\nA: Using Siri let’s you nail the start time. The system does still prefer to make a new appointment now if you don’t specify the start time or a start day. \n\nHey Siri, make an appointment for 10 am next Tuesday. \n\nAlso, for when the default calendar is lacking, you can get some very capable apps to extend how you view, automate and combine calendars if you don’t want to just add all your calendars to the native iOS settings and use Siri / calendar.app - the first two I recommend are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fantastical 2 - a powerhouse of intelligence and smart scheduling\n\n*Calendars 5 - also has better smart scheduling than iOS and has great integration for google calendars and other cloud calendars. \n\n\nYou don’t need another app, though to just make an appointment precisely when you want it to be slotted in your calendar, just use alternate input mechanisms. These third-party apps had smart scheduling before iOS implemented it, but now Apple ships everything you need so only get these if you need more than one Apple can do out of the box. \n", "Q: Is the macOS recovery also upgraded when i run mac upgrades? I upgraded my Macbook Pro that had Mojave (MACBOOK PRO (RETINA, 15-INCH, MID 2014))to Catalina Beta and this completely broke my Mobile Development using Flutter. There are numerous issues with version 10.15 that i just want to go back to Mojave.\nI want to completely downgrade to Mojave (i don't mind starting from Mavericks, then upgrading to Mojave, source)\nIf I go to the recovery menu and wipe the hard drive, then try recovery, which version will be installed? The original Mavericks that came with the macbook or the current Catalina beta i upgraded to recently. Is the recovery software also upgraded during upgrades? I don't have any backups as such don't intend to restore anything.\n\nA: When you restore a Mac from Internet Recovery it restores the OS version that came with the Mac when it shipped. So if your Mac came with Mavericks than it will reinstall Mavericks. From there you can then reinstall Mojave right over top of the new Mavericks installation.\nIt will not install beta OS versions as there must be an OS in place with the necessary macOSPublicBetaAccessUtility installed.\nAs for the recovery partition OS version, I am unsure of what happens to that during major macOS upgrades. I would think that it would not change as Internet Recovery works even with the recovery partition deleted. Which tells me that Internet Recovery is (at least mostly) built into the firmware of your Mac.\nCorrecting During an OS upgrade recovery is upgraded as well so you will get the latest (non beta) version of macOS. Thanks to @Tetsujin and the OP.\nGoing back a revision or two and then upgrading from there works perfectly well, it just takes longer. For that reason I always make a bootable USB installer of the last two versions of macOS and keep them in a drawer for eventualities such as these. 8GB flash drives are cheap and it takes little time to create a bootable macOS installer. Perhaps something to consider for the future.\n", "Q: can \"File system check exit code is 8\" be repaired? I have a startup disk from my old computer with error File system check exit code is 8.\ncan this be repaired?  I would like to use it to migrate files and settings to my new computer, it is an SSD if that makes any dif.  I do have the filed from this disk backed up but not the system settings needed for migration assistant to move tho new mac.\n\nA: Generally speaking it depends on what you mean by repaired.\nThat error indicates that the filesystem on that disk is damaged. The good news is that if you reformat it the disk will still be usable. That is also bad news, as you may have noted.\nYou can try running disk utility on that drive a few times (3 - 4) and see if is repairable. Depending on the filesystem in use on the drive you may be able to use something like DiskWarrior to fix the disk. But beware that DiskWarrior and pretty much all disk repair utilities can't repair APFS volumes (yet).\nIf that is the case you can try a data recovery utility or sending the drive off to be recovered for you, which can be expensive.\n\nA: I have found that recent Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu) may be able to gain read-only access on an unencrypted HFS+ drive, even if macOS is showing Error 8.\nAlthough this won't be a great way to migrate a system off it, it may be a fairly good way to recover individual documents and files.\n", "Q: How can I install vpfit on a 64 bit macOS?

When executed it warned me about removing \"...Siri..Application\". I kind of panicked, thinking it's trying to delete all files from system and immediately terminated the terminal process. \nI want to know if this command deleted any other files. I see most files there and am able to restart iMac so all seems good but just to be sure.\nPS: sorry for lack of full warning message. I quickly closed the terminal and not going to try command again to get it.\n\nA: The path you gave rm to delete was /./*. Let’s break this down:\n\n\n*\n\n*/ The root mount point, such as Macintosh HD. This is the root of the disk, therefore an absolute path was given rather than a relative path operating on the current directory. \n\n*./ The current directory, which is now / by the path given so far. /. is equivalent to /, so // is the path so far, except duplicate directory delimiters are combined to a single delimiter, so / so far, the same as step 1.\n\n** Glob all files and folders at this level.\n\n\nTherefore, the command given was to delete all files and folders starting at the root mount point, i.e. delete all files and folders on the entire volume.\nmacOS System Integrity Protection will prevent this mischief from causing much damage to the system’s core components, but your own files won’t be protected if you have given full disk access to the Terminal app. I hope you have a backup of the files you need, especially from the beginning of the disk depending when you stopped the command.\n\nA: A few recalls, of course everything is in man pages.\n\n\n*\n\n*/ is the \"path separator\", i.e. the character to separate folder (and optional terminal file) names.\n\n*paths can be either relative (to current working directory) or absolute (i.e. from the root folder) and a path beginning with / is absolute. Other are relative.\n\n*folders have \"entries\" which can be of various types, usually folders and files (but not only)\n\n*the rm command takes a list of files to delete, and has option \"-r\" which means : recursive, in that case, it can take a folder as argument.\n\n\n*\n\n*folders always have special entries: \".\" and \"..\" which are special folder names corresponding to \"current\" and \"parent\" folders.\n\n*commands in terminal are executed by a shell, there are many shells, usually you can find your shell using \"echo $SHELL\", a popular one is \"BASH\". In most shells \"*\" is a \"glob character\", for instance, open bash manual (example: execute: \"man bash\" in a terminal) and then look for \"Pathname Expansion\", e.g. by typing \"/Pathname Expansion\", you can also look for \"GLOBIGNORE\". The behaviour of expansion can be controlled by some env vars and shell settings, but we can assume you use the default, which is \"replace by all entries matching the glob, but not starting by '.' \"\n\n\n\nSo, the shell will execute the command like this: rm -r /./*\n\n\n*\n\n*split command line in items, separated by \"white spaces\" : \"rm\" , \"-r\" and \"/./*\"\n\n*apply a series or transformations, here only pathname expansion of the \"\" (example of other transformations: variable expansion)\na. with \"\" it considers the item is a path\nb. The path is split into items separated by \"/\" : \"\" , \".\" and \"\"\nc. as the first element is empty, it is an absolute path starting at / (or you could consider that \"/./\" begins with \"/\" so it is absolute, and then remove from the list..)\nd. ok, in root folder look for entry \".\" : it is there, and in fact it reports back to the same folder it is in, i.e. \"/\"\ne. in this folder (/), look for all entries (folders and files) not string with \".\"\nf. replace the item that was globbed in step 1 with the list found, i.e. it will give something like: rm -r /./folder1 /./folder2 /./file1 ...\n\n*execute the resulting command, by creating a new process whose executable is specified by the first item of list in 1.\na. if the first argument starts with / it is an absolute path, else the executable is search in folders specified by variable PATH\nb. other items in list are provided as argument to the new process : \"-r\" , \"/./folder1\", \"/./folder2\", \"/./file1\" etc...\n\n*the rm command will recursively delete folders and files as specified by the list of folders and files now expanded.\n\n\nThe real key here is that commands in terminal are executed by the shell, and a trick to know what is actually done is simply to add \"echo\" at the beginning of the command.\nIn general it has no other effect than displaying the result of shell expansions. (unless you have backticks `` or $() command substitutions)\nexample here:\n$ echo rm -r /./*\nrm -r /./Applications /./Library /./Network /./System /./Users /./Volumes /./bin /./cores /./dev /./etc /./home /./installer.failurerequests /./net /./opt /./private /./sbin /./tmp /./usr /./var\n\nMy last advice:\nnever do things like \"rm -r *\" or equivalent, for the following reasons:\n1- usually it does not do what you want which is : delete everything in current folder. No, it deletes everything which do not start with \".\" (i.e. hidden files and folders)\n2- it is dangerous !!! something the current working directory is not what you thing it is .\n3- I find it much more efficient and safe to do the following, lets say you are in folder: /Users/laurent/folder_to_cleanup\n$ cd ..\n$ rm -fr folder_to_cleanup\n$ mkdir folder_to_cleanup\n\nThis effectively safely deletes everything from the folder, including the folder, and then re-creates one if you need it.\n", "Q: Can a book stored in Kindle be saved as a file on my iMac. Would like to open in Calibre I bought a Kindle version of a reference book from Amazon. The Kindle reader for the iMac is not my favorite application and I would like to load the book in Calibre and possibly save as a PDF. Or just read it using Calibre. Does anyone know if this is possible?\n\nA: In a word yes.\nyou can connect your Kindle to your Mac and browse through the filesystem and find the books folder and copy the files out.\nI have found, however, that the files stored on the Kindle itself are kind of similar to a macOS package format. EG a folder full of files. Rather than deal with that I just logged onto my Amazon account, went to my Kindle purchases and selected a book I want to download. Books being rather small things as downloads go they come across quickly.\nAnd then you have an \".azw\" file which is got Amazon's DRM on it. Which means you can only read it on a Kindle signed in to your Amazon account or a Kindle app on another device that is signed in to your Amazon Account.\nThat can be bypassed, but is beyond the scope of what we can do on AskDifferent. But if you want a hint, google for something like remove DRM from azw files with Calibre.

Might be a good opportunity to upgrade to a SSD. \n", "Q: Webpage Login Issues — How to Diagnose I have two Macs: a 2015 iMac that lives on my desk, and a 2013 MacBook Air. I have accounts at usaa.com, and like to use Safari. While I can log into USAA's webpage easily on the Air, I'm not able to do so on the iMac...unless I switch to Chrome, which logs in correctly. \nBoth Macs run macOS 10.14.6 (18G87), and both run  Safari 12.1.2 (14607.3.9); all software is up to date. Wondering if there was a corrupted cache on the iMac, I restarted in Safe Mode; in Safe Mode, and again after rebooting in regular mode, I was unable to log in using Safari on the iMac. I enabled the Develop Menu (Safari > Preferences > Advanced > \"Show Develop Menu\"), then chose Develop > Empty Caches to clear Safari's caches. No improvement. I trashed the Keychain entries for this webpage, and entered my login and password manually. Still no go with Safari on the iMac.\nThe login process is to enter my ID and password on a single page, then hit \"Enter.\" The next page asks for my PIN, a 4-numeral number. The page after that asks for me to choose email or a text number to receive a login code. Choosing one option and hitting \"Enter\" modifies the screen to receive the email address or text number. Hitting \"enter\" then either presents a screen in which to enter the login code (Safari on the MBA, Chrome on either machine), or a screen that again asks me to choose email or a text number (Safari on the iMac). \nThis is perplexing, especially since the iMac's Safari began misbehaving only two days ago, after being able to fully log in with this user ID and password and PIN for a bit more than two years and several macOS updates. No changes of any kind (updates, new extensions) have been made in the last month on either machine. EDIT: a similar but not identical misbehavior has also now appeared in a second, unrelated restaurant reservation page. Safari returns only a placeholder red dot, presumably indicating a page loading (or failing to load); in any event, the next screen (picking a date) never loads. As before, Chrome works correctly, and Safari on the MBP also works correctly and loads the page.\nI see no other misbehaviors or oddities in the iMac's or Safari's operation. \nSomething is awry in the iMac's Safari. How might I further diagnose the issue? Am I stuck with trying a reinstall of macOS?\n\nA: @Tetsujin earns the garland.\nThe iMac's Safari had uBlock Origin 1.16.0 installed. When deactivated in Safari > Preferences > Extensions, Safari now loads the two problematic webpages correctly.\nI'll guess that one of uBlock's data streams (it was subscribed to several, in aid of my trying to block persistent cookie-approval popups) was changed sometime last week, and began hobbling Safari. The cookie-popup blocking was very effective, but the impaired usability turned out to be a cure worse than the disease. \n", "Q: Is Apple Keyring data stored locally-only on devices? I would like to understand if the keyring database is stored only on the local Apple device or if it is also stored on servers on the internet.\n\nA: As Mike Scott wrote, depending on your iCloud backup.\nSee \"Set up iCloud Keychain\".\nSee \"Keychain data protection\" on page 20 of the \"iOS Security Guide\" for how the keychain works, how it protects access to keychain items so they are only available when the phone is unlocked, using the secure enclave processor.\n", "Q: How can I ground this charger This charger came with my MacBbook Pro which I bought from India.\n\nThe other end is connected to the magsafe adapter's ground pin. What do I need to insert here?\n\nA: You need an international travel adaptor, from the European plug type, specifically plug types E & F, to an Indian plug, type D.\nSee WorldStandards - Plug & socket types for further information.\nIf you are a competent electrician, you could snip off the existing 'foreign' plug & change it for a domestic… I would weigh that against not recognising the plug type & solution & say \"Don't do that yourself!\"\nYou can get travel adaptors in any airport & usually at stores that cater to travellers, e.g. luggage stores, or generally in tourist areas.\nNote: Apple power supplies are multi-voltage, so you don't need to make any allowances for a potential supply difference between the two.

Every now and then we need to reinstall or install new systems. It is a pretty cumbersome procedure to reinstall all our basic apps (Slack, Adobe Creative Cloud, anti-virus scanner, etc...). Is there any low-cost / free way to automate this process? \n\nA: I'd recommend looking into an MDM system, that is the way Apple expects fleets of Macs to be administered. There is a bare-bones version available in Apple's Server app, but there are also commercial solutions from companies like Jamf, Mosyle, or Cisco's Meraki.\nWith an MDM system you can have settings (including VPN and email) and application installs based on the individual machine or user, or groups of machines or users. Any changes you make are pushed over the network.\nWhen a new person comes on board, you should be able to just wipe the old employee's device, give the new person a user name and password and let them go through the Apple system setup, which for a managed device includes any settings you have defined for that user or device.\nAnything available in the App Store is easy to manage, Apple has a volume purchase program that allows you to assign App Store apps to either machines (no Apple ID required by user) or to the user (the user will need an Apple ID). It looks like Apple is going to start offering managed Apple IDs for businesses in the near future.\nThe commercial MDMs usually have a solution for non App Store apps, but I think Adobe Creative Cloud can be a problem for MDM systems (you may not be surprised to hear that). The solution for me has been to move to CC for Teams which gives you a admin account and a license pool that you can assign users to and then Adobe sends them an invite to install the software. It is more expensive, but is the best option for managing CC licenses in a business.\nGetting setup with an MDM can be a little involved, but the commercial MDM providers should be able to assist you with all of the steps.\n", "Q: I can use my watch to ping my phone, but how can i use my phone to ping my watch I have an Apple Watch and one if its most useful functions is that I can swipe up and tap the ping iPhone icon to make my iPhone beep at me. This saves my bacon 4 or 5 times each week when I misplace my phone around the house. But I can’t find how to do the opposite. I sometimes misplace my watch and I want to be able to ping it from my phone, but there isn’t an option that I can find in the Watch app on my phone.

I'm able to boot the iMac, no problem.\nHowever, when I connect the iMac to the MacBook Pro and press Command-F2, nothing happens.  \nI know the iMac supports Target Display Mode, because I used to use it for that when connecting to my old work laptop.  \nIt's the same cable I used to use, so it's not a cable problem.\nI've successfully driven my LG monitor using the Mini Display Port on the MacBook Pro, so I'm pretty sure the port is fully operational.\nWhat could be stopping it from working?\nIs there anything about booting Mojave from an external flash drive that might stop Target Display Mode from working?\nOr is it possible that the MacBook Pro just can't handle driving that particular display?\nAny suggestions on how to get this working?\n\nA: I don’t know if it’ll work with the Mini DisplayPort. I was stuck in a nasty half boot to grey screen problem last November on my 2011 27” iMac. While I was troubleshooting I tried the mini display port and tried TDM but it didn’t work. So I bought a Thunderbolt cable and then a FireWire cable or vice versa. The Thunderbolt cable worked... but I think the FireWire worked too. Now I’m starting to doubt my memory. I was going the other direction though. iMac TDM on a MBP. I tried the MDP port w/my old 2009 MBP & the 2012 MBP. Neither worked with my iMac. It That was just my experience. It’s worth trying a TB or a FW cable. I just remember the mini display port didn’t work for TDM for me. Which sucked because I had multiple mini display cables/adapters lying around from porting my laptops to the TV but I had a tough time finding the other cables in my town. The only Thunderbolt cable I could buy was super short. That’s how I’m certain that it definitely worked. I had to stack books to get the laptop close enough.   I think I had no choice but to order the FireWire online. Hope you get it to work. :-)\n", "Q: iPhone: Disable syncing for mail account, but keep existing e-mails I have a university e-mail account (Exchange, if that makes a difference) which for reasons that aren’t relevant to this question does not work at the moment. The underlying user account has been disabled on the university’s servers, and I cannot log in.\nThis means my iPhone is constantly asking for a password – it obviously can’t connect since the account is frozen – and telling me it cannot fetch e-mail for this account. That is exceedingly frustrating. (It’s also terrible UI/UX to repeatedly block the entire interface from the user every time the app is opened, but that’s a different matter.)\nIn order to get rid of this infuriating, incessant pestering for a password that I can’t give, I would like to temporarily disable syncing from this account, but only syncing. Old e-mails which have been fetched should still appear in the inbox and subfolders and be searchable; it just shouldn’t try to actually connect to the server to fetch or send new e-mail.\nThis question asks about more or less the same thing, except it’s for OS X Mail, which works quite differently from iOS Mail, and it is about a permanently defunct mail address, whereas this question is about an account which will hopefully be online again at some point in the not too distant future.\nGoogling this, I found hundreds of tutorials on how to set up and remove e-mail accounts (I know how to do both; neither is what I’m looking for), but nothing useful.\nThe closest I got was a site telling me to uncheck the “Mail” option in the account settings. While this does indeed stop Mail from trying to connect to the server, it also completely wipes the account from the Mail app, deleting every trace of the account’s inbox and folders, which rather defeats the purpose. (In another case of shockingly bad UX, it does this without any kind of warning, meaning I’ve now already irreversibly lost all e-mails in this account on one phone – thankfully the one I don’t use much.)\nIs there no way to tell Mail to stop trying in vain to sync this account, but not change anything else?\n\nA: MS Exchange is a system not too different from the way IMAP works: most of the mail is kept on the server and generally only recent mail and/or headers are kept on the local PC.\nYou can keep your mail but it is a bit of a work-around. Essentially you need to create a bunch of new mailboxes that mirror your folders on your Exchange account. You would go to\nMailbox > New Mailbox... > Location > On my Mac\nGive the folder a name and repeat for any other folders you want to save, making sure that when you create the new folder it is \"On my Mac\"\nOnce that is done, open the Folders of the Exchange mailboxes one at a time, select all the emails (Command A) and drag them to the correspondingly named folder you just created. repeat for all folders.\nRemember that Exchange may not have downloaded the whole email and you may just be dragging the email headers from one mailbox to another. Without a connection to the Exchange server that is the best you can do.\nNow you could delete that account without fear of losing your email.\nIt is possible to get an archive of your email account, assuming the Exchange server admin is willing to or allowed to do so. On an Exchange server you can export a mailbox or whole email account to a PST file. Once you have the PST file you can use Outlook for the Mac (or a free conversion utility) to open the PST file and view your old emails.\n", "Q: Can I force Safari to show the toolbar in login windows? When I buy something on a website, Safari often opens a popup window for payment (e.g. for logging into PayPal). \nThis popup doesn't have a toolbar, which means my password manager extension (1Password) is not visible and I can't autofill anything. In the menu bar, there's no command View->Toolbar. How can I get the toolbar to show up? \n\nA: Use the 1Password autofill keyboard shortcut Command + \\ to fill the login information.\nYou don’t need the toolbar visible in order to invoke 1Password.

Is there a way to access a menu or list of all the sheets in a Numbers document, so I can quickly jump to one specific sheet without having to scroll or page one-by-one with the previous/next keyboard shortcuts?\nI am looking for something similar to how the right-click on the sheet's tab will bring up a list of all the tables and graphs on that Sheet, so you can jump right to a specific table or graph. \n\nA: \nIs there a way to access a menu or list of all the sheets in a Numbers document, so I can quickly jump to one specific sheet without having to scroll or page one-by-one with the previous/next keyboard shortcuts?\n\nThe only way I know of is to AppleScript it and use some mechanism to trigger the script, e.g. an Automator Service1.\nAs an example, pressing ⌃⌘S in Numbers with a Stocks.numbers document opened and frontmost, I get a choose from list dialog box as shown in the next image:\n\nI then selected sheet 1-Year History and then clicked OK and was taken to that sheet in the document. Note that double-clicking on any list item takes one to that sheet directly without having to click OK or press Enter. (You can also type the first character of the list item or use down/up arrow keys too.)\n\nObviously with a Numbers document that has only five sheets this isn't really necessary, and is just an example for when the document has the number of sheets that would necessitate scrolling through the sheets tabs in the document to get to the one wanted. On my MBP 15\" Retina display, I was able to see 37 sheets without having to scroll in the Go To Sheet... list box. (This will vary based on the screen resolution and height of the Dock.)\nCreate an Automator Service1 as show in the next image:\n\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Numbers\" to set sheetList to name of every sheet of document 1\n\ntell current application to activate\nchoose from list sheetList with title \"Go To Sheet...\" with prompt \"Please select a sheet name:\"\nif the result is not false then\n    my selectSheet(result as text)\nend if\n\non selectSheet(n)\n    try\n        tell application \"Numbers\"\n            activate\n            -- # The following code causes Numbers to go to the selected sheet.\n            -- # It is not modifying the existing data in the target cell, however,\n            -- # it does cause a saved document to show as edited, temporarily, \n            -- # and resolved by the code in the following System Events tell block.\n            set value of first cell of first table of sheet n of front document to ¬\n                (value of first cell of first table of sheet n of front document)\n        end tell\n\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            -- # Undo Typing so the document doesn't show as edited if already saved,\n            -- # and if already saved the modified date/time stamp shouldn't change.\n            keystroke \"z\" using command down\n            -- # Press the escape key to remove focus from cell A1.         \n            key code 53\n        end tell\n\n    on error eStr number eNum\n        display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n            default button 1 with icon caution\n        return\n    end try\nend selectSheet\n\n\nAppleScript Code Note: As far as I know, Numbers does not have an explicit AppleScript command to select a given sheet and this is sort of an alternative method and it does cause a saved document to show as edited temporarily, even though it's not altering the value of the target cell, and resolved by the code in the System Events tell block. It works by setting the value of cell \"A1\" to it's current value, so while it's perceived as an edit, no data has been altered from its current value and if it was already saved, the modified date/time stamp shouldn't change. This works for me in Numbers 5.1 in macOS High Sierra on a read-write document, and is why I use it. As coded, it is not intended to be used on a locked or read-only document. Additional coding would be necessary for that scenario. \n\nFor System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services:\n\n\nNote: Sometimes with an Automator Service1 and assigning a keyboard shortcut, you may first have to trigger it from the target App's Services menu one time.

Can recap if it may be helpful.\n\nA: I have recently created some tools that may assist you, though they do not currently directly support encryption (coming soon, hopefully): https://github.com/jivanpal/apfs-tools\nUsing apfs-inspect to see the state of the APFS container superblocks would be my first step. Since the drive is encrypted, you won't be able to easily get much done until I add encryption support, but let's at least see whether the container superblocks and volume superblocks are intact. You will likely need to dig out the key- and volume-encryption keys and decrypt the volume file-system trees and file data manually.\n\nTried Recovery Studio Pro on Win10 and it noted that no apfs keys were found after a full scan, which is why I am wondering if some item required to decrypt is wiped and if it might be able to be recovered and placed back in there from a backup.\n\nHundreds of versions of the container superblock will exist on the drive, so hopefully at least one is intact. Similarly, multiple copies of the encryption keys will also exist at multiple places on the drive, and the container superblocks specify their location. Hopefully at least one instance is readable, whence we can work closer towards reading the volumes.\n\nI believe Jonathan Levin's public release of his fsleuth tool (download the binary at http://newosxbook.com/tools/fsleuth) supports APFS encryption, but this public release is from October 2018, and the APFS spec for dentries has changed since then. Thus, if you are able to see the contents of your APFS volumes, the file and directory names may be reported incorrectly (preceded with ??), and you may not be able to do much, but at least you will know the files are there somewhere.\nSkip to the 45-minute mark of this talk (1.28 GB MP4 file) by Levin to see how to use fsleuth.\nI'm unsure if Levin is still maintaining his fully-featured, paid version of fsleuth, but that may be your last resort. — EDIT: It seems that fsleuth is being privately handed over to the highest bidder; you may want to contact Levin ASAP if you want to purchase a license for it.\n", "Q: Regain data from iphone 6s(not sure if plus) factory reset? Sorry if this is not the right place to ask this, but I'm not sure of anywhere else I can post this.\nSome time ago I changed my iPhone(iPhone 6s or 6s plus, not sure which, should be latest ios, 12 at the least.) password, but now I forgot and I have tried until I reached the 'iPhone is disabled, connect to itunes' page. I have went to the apple service providers with Proof of Purchase and they said my only option is to restore my iPhone, which will wipe out all my data. I was also told the same by a data recovery specialist I was recommended to try by said provider. Is there any alternative? Can I factory reset my phone and try to find the original files using some other third party data recoverer or is factory reset the same as restore and will also overwrite the data?\nI know the files will be likely to be encrypted and take a long time to decrypt, if not forever. That is fine, as long as I can extract the files, encrypted or not I am ok with their status.\n\nA: If you have not done a backup either to iTunes or to iCloud, then there aren't any ways to do retrieve that information. It is an Apple security mechanism. Hypothetically, let's say someone stole your phone, tried to guess your password over and over, it would disable it. There are programs to access a lower level of the phone, but they require it to be unlocked. The only thing I can think of is using major data recovery, like through DriveSavers or Kroll Ontrack recovery services. They're quite expensive though. It'd recommend attempting to restore from your most recent iCloud backup. It won't hurt. \nUnfortunately, if that doesn't work, you will have to restore your phone, and there won't be a way to get that information back.\n", "Q: \"The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items.\" when moving OneDrive files OneDrive has a feature called \"Files On-Demand\", I'm playing arround with it and trying to figure out how it works. It looks like OneDrive uses sparse files as placeholders before the really file is downloaded to local.

The system asked me to enter password to allow this operation then it failed with message \"The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items.\".\n\nI've changed file permissions to rwxrwxrwx and ACL permissions to Read & Write but still doesn't work.\n\nI like to understand what is going underneath. Why those files can not being moved when OneDrive is not running. I appreciate your help!\n\nA: I had the same problem. What worked for me was to open the source file, which probably triggered the on-demand download. Then I was able to move/copy it elsewhere.\nYou could probably also go to OneDrive Preferences and click \"Turn Off Files On-Demand\"\n\nA: I had the same issue and had luck with the following: \nInstead of dragging the folder, try to simply right click and copy from one location and then paste into the new location (one drive). \nHope this works for you as it has for me. \n\nA: So I had the same problem and it seems to me that the issue is that the OneDrive app is not open. What I did is opened the OneDrive app so it's syncing in the background and one way to confirm it's open is that you can then see it in top taskbar (attached pic), and then it all worked just fine.\nHope this helps! \n\n\nA: Try double-clicking this:\n/Applications/OneDrive.app/Contents/Resources/ResetOneDriveAppStandalone.command\n\nYou'll need to log in again, and make sure you point to the same folder as before.\n\nA: The permissions this error is referencing are not the POSIX permissions (rwx), but the ACL permissions associated with the file.\nACLs are denoted with a \"+\" at the end of the standard POSIX permissions in a ls -la command.\nYou can remove all ACL permissions for a file with the following:\nsudo chmod -N $path_to_file\n\nOr all files in a folder with:\nsudo chmod -RN $path_to_folder\n\nTo read a File's ACLs:\nls -lae $path_to_file\n\nAdditional Information about POSIX and File Extension Attributes at this answer\n\nA: I had a similar issue with files in a portable drive I swapped between Windows and MacOS. For some unexplained reason some files had the user immutable flag set, thus, would not be deleted even using sudo rm.\nFor me, what worked was to run the following command in the terminal:\nsudo chflags -R nouchg '/Volumes/DriveName/DirectoryPath'\nI am no expert, but put simply: this clears the \"user immutable flag\" on all files under the DirectoryPath. The man page should give you more details.\nI discovered this in an apple forum, so credit goes to the user who posted it. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I had the same problem and then found out that I had put the OneDrive sync app on pause. After starting the sync process again the problem was gone.\n\nA: I tried most of the things suggested here, and nothing was still working, I was getting the error \"The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have permission to access some of the items.\"\nIn my case, it was a single symbolic link that was causing the copy to fail, ls -al and removed, I could copy the files across.\nThe problem is that there were other links in the files to be copied, and those had no issues.\n", "Q: Quick Shortcut to skim through web search results I wish to utilize all the shortcuts I can, but I'm not sure how it is called in the first place.

Assuming there is an defective battery, you can't 'manage' its safety with any specific behaviour. It could fail and overheat while in use, or while charging.\nThe odd recall notwithstanding, Apple has worked very hard at making laptops use minimal power when closed, while also allowing some necessary background tasks; and then letting them spring back to life when you open the lid.\nModern SSDs use a fraction of the power of the old mechanical hard drives that needed to be spun down to save energy.\nI rarely turn off my 2014 MacBook Pro, and only reboot it when updating the OS or troubleshooting. \n\nA: Your setting of hybernate mode is the one to achieve exactly what you described.\nBut you are correct. I use this setting since many years and through many versions of MacOS (Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra & High Sierra).\nFrom memory I reported many times the same problem to Apple about this mode failing on output of hibernation when the battery was nearly empty.\nI guess there is a problem about correctly evaluating the power required to make the /var/vm/sleepimage dump of the virtual memory.\nSince they never answered me, I guess they never fully understood the problem.\nNow I know for sure that the function lidwake is failing.\n\nIs hibernate no longer supported on this model?\n\nNo it is still supported.\nBut since a negative question is leading to confusing answers\nhere is a clearer one.\nThe command to check directly the availability of this function is:\npmset -g cap\n\nand look for the key function: hybernatemode\nAnother way to detect if a Mac is coming from a sleep or an hibernation state is through:\nnvram 'boot-args=-v'\n\nwhich will turn the boot code in verbose mode.\n", "Q: Adding smb printer through terminal Goal: Add a domain printer just through the terminal without using its IP address.\nFollowing the instructions here:\nhttps://dae.me/blog/1826/add-a-printer-via-command-line-in-os-x/#comment-256587\nI ran this command:\nsudo lpadmin -p sharp4141n -L \"front office code\" -E smb://ESC-PRINT01.byu.local/ESCN284_MX-4141N -P /Users/jaybrown/Desktop/ESC_PRINT01_ESC_N284_SHARP_MX_4141N_PCL6.ppd\n\nBut get the error: \nlpadmin: Unknown argument “smb://ESC-PRINT01.byu.local/ESCN284_MX-4141N”.\n\nI am on a domain.

I have been using Airmail 3 (highly regarded email client from Bloop that you get via the Mac App store) for some time now, but I am not sure how trustworthy they are.  What concerns me about the app is how much outbound traffic there is.   I use the Little Snitch firewall so I can see how much traffic is coming out of Airmail 3.  What I see is close to 1GB over a period of one year.  This may seem reasonable at first blush, but I almost never use Airmail 3 to access email.  My email provider is Gmail and I access this service through the mail.google.com website for 99.9% of the time.  So the question is what is all this data that Airmail 3 is sending?  Is it just from the handshake protocol of Airmail asking Google if there is new mail in my inbox?  \nOf asked Airmail 3 support and they claim to not store any user data (except under one exceptional condition that I did not trigger).\nSo I don't know what is going on, but I don't like all this outbound communication. \n\nA: Privacy Policy and EULA\nYou should read Bloop SRL's Privacy Policy and End User Licence Agreement.\nBound by the GDPR\nAs an Italian organisation, based within the European Union, Bloop SRL is bound by the General Data Protection Regulation which should give you some reassurance.\nNo absolutes\nHowever, no-one here can answer with absolute certainty that you can trust your information with the organisation. Policies and organisations can and do change.\n\nA: I found a method that partially answers my question of where all the outbound traffic is going.  In looking at Little Snitch again I realized that I could get aggregate data for traffic to some sites that the program communicates with.  This data covers about half of all the outbound data the program has ever sent.  I put this info into a spreadsheet and found that 99.4% of outbound data is going to domains owned by Google.  So this seems legit.  \nThe only flaw to this method is that it only covers about half of the total data sent since installing the program.  But if I assume that this other now opaque traffic followed a similar pattern, then it looks like the behavior of the program is good with respect to privacy.\n", "Q: Poor WiFi Performance on iPhone When migrating to a new router I remarked my iPhone (7Plus) had lousy TX performance compared to the other 80211.ac Apple devices connected to the same wireless SSID as revealed in below screenshot:\n\nSince it was a new router, I figured maybe there was some inconsistent configuration going on somewhere.

So I moved it about 4 feet away (in same room). Still terrible TX performance on just this one device. Other than proximity (which I just checked) which can affect wireless performance, why was this iPhone non-performant?!?!?\n\nA: Nothing to do with the router in the end.

Switch to the icon of a grey Apple logo with a pair of red vertical bars layered on. \nWith the desktop window in front, on the host macOS window bar for the VM, choose View > Exit Coherence. All your app windows snap back to the desktop window.\n\nThat takes care of half your Question. Perhaps someone else can post on how to kill the Coherence feature entirely.\n", "Q: Cannot drag a window in Catalina Beta I am running macOS Catalina 10.15 Beta in a virtual machine on Parallels Desktop for Mac version 15.0.0.\nI installed the Beta on top of Mojave what was working well within the VM. Unfortunately, after installing Catalina Beta, I cannot drag any windows. \nWhen I click on the title bar of a window and drag, the window moves a few pixels and stops. If I repeat, I can barely make progress, progressively moving the window a few pixels at a time. Obviously inching along a few pixels at a time is unworkable and renders Catalina Beta useless. \nThis problem affects windows in all apps: the Finder, the \"About this Mac\" window, the Feedback Assistant window, and so on.\nAny workarounds or fixes?\n\nA: The workaround is to go into the VM’s settings and on the Mouse & Keyboard pane change the mouse and keyboard to be “Optimize for games”.  The drawback to using that setting is that it automatically activates the “Mouse pointer sticks at window edges” function, with no way to disable it.\n", "Q: Has Apple indicated that some 2019 MacBook Pros have a fault relating to power, battery or shutdown issues? I bought a MacBook Pro two days ago and when I was using it for the first time I noticed that when it drops below 40% (20%-40%) it shuts down with no warning and it's impossible to turn it back on unless I plug in the power cable. I thought it must be a hardware issue so I got it replaced for a new one. I set up my new computer and I found out that it had the same issue.\nI tried resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) as per Apple's instructions at: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201295 \nUnfortunately, this didn't resolve the issue.\nAt this point I think it would be stupid to buy a third MacBook Pro just to find out that it's not working again.\nHas anyone come across any information that indicates this is a known issue?\nFor the record, here is my battery information:    \n  CHARGE INFORMATION:\n\nCharge Remaining (mAh): 5107\n\n Fully Charged: No(its 100%)\n\nCharging:   Yes\n\nFull Charge Capacity (mAh): 5159\n\nHEALTH INFORMATION:\n\nCycle Count:    3\n\nCondition:  Normal(1 day old battery)\n\nBattery Installed:  Yes\n\nAmperage (mA):  2439\n\nVoltage (mV):   12516\n\n\nA: At this stage it's too early in the product cycle for this model to know if this rates as a known issue for Apple. \nHowever, any product, no matter the type or manufacturer, can have a fault and having bad batches of components is not unheard of. Apple does use warranty extension programs, replacement programs and repair programs if/when it identifies there's a definite issue to address. At this stage though it would be pure speculation, even if a handful of MacBook Pros presented with the same issue.\nYou indicate you've reset the SMC as per Apple's instructions, but just to be thorough your model MacBook Pro has a T2 chip and you have two options for resetting the SMC (the 2nd to be tried if the first fails).\nResetting the SMC on a 2019 MacBook Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP. \n\n*Press and hold the power button for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go of the power button and wait 5 seconds\n\n*Power up your MBP again\n\n\nOnce you've reset the SMC fully charge your MBP and see how you go. If it's still misbehaving, reset the SMC again but with the following steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP. \n\n*Press and hold the right shift key and the left option and control keys for 7 seconds before then also pressing and holding the power button (or Touch ID button) down for another 7 seconds (i.e. the keys will end up being held down for 14 seconds, the power button for 7 seconds)\n\n*Let go of all three keys and the power button\n\n*Wait 5 seconds\n\n*Power up your MBP again\n\n\nNow test your MBP again.\nIf the above fails, then I'd be talking to Apple Support to explain what's happening. If they can't address the issue then you're entitled to a refund or replacement, but you'll want to get onto it straight away so that a case is logged this early in your ownership.\n\nA: You've already taken one machine back and Apple accepted that it was faulty and replaced it: it would not be stupid to do the same again if it's exhibiting the same symptoms. \nI'd say three Macs in a row would be amazingly rare and unlucky, or it would indeed hint at some significant production fault. Either way, Apple needs to know and get it fixed for you.\n", "Q: Will backing up files also include files that are marked for deletion? If i use Time Machine to back up my data to an additional disk, will the backup also contain files marked for deletion that have not been overwritten yet?\nTo clarify, I do not mean files in the recycling bin, I mean files that have been already emptied from the bin that require tools like Photorec to recover\nThanks for any help\n\nA: No. Time Machine only backs up files present on the filesystem and furthermore, only those not excluded by a rule or explicit exception. \n\n\n*\n\n*On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\n\n*What does Time Machine back up?\n\nA: Time Machine does not backup deleted files. The whole point of maintaining a backup is to make copies before files are deleted -- so that if you want to restore them after deletion, you can do so. \nIt is not useful to think of deleted files as merely 'marked for deletion but still there'. \nHaving said that, the APFS format does make 'local snapshots', which are alternative catalog entries to older data, including deleted files. So if you're looking to recover deleted files that have not been previously backed up by Time Machine, then the local snapshots may preserve them.\nYou can browse local snapshots by entering the Time Machine app when the external backup drive is NOT connected. \nAbout local snapshots\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2016 13 inch - Display turns off whenever I physically adjust it Whenever I try to adjust the angle of my screen my display just turns off. I know the Macbook itself doesn't turn off because I can still hear sound and the keyboard is still lit up. But if I try to adjust the screen, the display just turns off and it's a gamble whether or not it's going to turn back on. I've tried closing it and reopening it but sometimes that doesn't work. I can turn it off and back on but again, the display may or may not turn back on depending on how it's feeling I guess.\nGoogling this hasn't been helpful, and Apple Diagnostics is reporting no problems. Any ideas?\nEDIT: I've discovered that after closing the screen, I can adjust the screen to about 90 degrees until it turns off. Strange.\n\nA: After further Googling turns out this is a common issue with this model of Macbook. Apple will fix it for free. https://support.apple.com/13-inch-macbook-pro-display-backlight-service\n", "Q: Why can’t I use a Live Photo as a wallpaper I've got an iPhone 6. I know it is capable to set a live photo as the device wallpaper. But I couldn't do it because it only gives me 'still' and 'perspective' as the options. So how can I set a live photo as a wallpaper?\n\nA: iPhone 6 does not support live wallpapers. You need to use a jailbreak tweak like LiveWallEnabler to enable live wallpapers using long press on a device without 3D Touch hardware.\n", "Q: DNS resolution works for nslookup but fails in browser while using openconnect Trying to use openconnect to connect to Cisco Anyconnect VPN.\nI just did brew install openconnect and use it from cmd line like this:\n\nsudo openconnect --authgroup=VPN-SSL-GROUP -u FIRST_LAST@domain.com vpn.domain.com\n\nThen I try to access resource.domain.com name from private network and get:\n\n\n*\n\n*in Chrome: DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN\n\n*in Network Utility -> Lookup: resource.domain.com -> The operation couldn’t be completed.

Apple released Apple Card this month (August 2019). What is it and how is it different from other similar cards?\nHow do I apply for it? How do I know if it's available in my country?\n\nA: Apple Card, a self branded card is a new kind of credit card to be used in conjugation with Apple Pay. It is created by Apple in partnership with Goldman Sachs. Apple claims to have focused on simplicity, transparency and privacy with Apple Card.\nIt is currently available only to the citizens of United States. You need to have an Apple Pay compatible iPhone, running recent version of iOS to be able to use it.\n(Note: The official documentation doesn't state what is the minimum version required to use Apple Card (it only mentions recent iOS version), Apple Card was rolled out after iOS 12.4 was released. So it could be safely assumed that your device need to run at least iOS 12.4).\nYou'll also need to have Two-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID.\n\nHow do I apply for one?\n\nTo apply for it, you need to be signed into iCloud with your Apple ID on your iPhone. Once done, open the Wallet app on your iPhone, tap on the ⨁ button, select Apple Card and tap Continue.\nYou'll be asked to fill out the requisite information. If your application is approved, a digital version of Apple Card is issued immediately, and is ready to use via Apple Pay.\nApple has added an information video on their official YouTube channel demonstrating the application process:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Card — How to apply\nFor scenarios where Apple Pay is not available, such as brick and mortar stores, you can also request Apple for a physical card. The physical card is made up of titanium and carries your name on the front. It is called Titanium Apple Card.\nThe physical card will be shipped to your address by Apple. It's a Mastercard and can be used anywhere in the world where Mastercard is accepted.\nApple claims that the physical card is more secure than other credit cards as it doesn't contain a card number, CVV code, expiration date or your signature externally.\nTo learn more about Apple Card, refer to the following Apple Support documents and official links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Card\n\n*How to apply for Apple Card\n\n*How to use Apple Card\n\n*Request and use your titanium Apple Card\n\n*How your Apple Card application is evaluated\n\nHow do I know if it's available in my country?\n\nApple Card is currently only being issued to U.S. citizens.

If I lost my AirPods, would I need to be within Bluetooth range to be able to detect them on my iPhone?\n\nA: How this feature works is detailed in the Apple Support document, If your AirPods are lost:\n\nWith iOS 10.3 or later, Find My iPhone can help you locate your missing AirPods. If you already set up Find My iPhone with an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that you’re using with your AirPods, it's automatically enabled for your AirPods too. So if your AirPods are lost, out of their case, and somewhere close by, you can use Find My iPhone to find them again. If your AirPods are out of range of all of your devices, need to charge, or are in the AirPod Case, Find My iPhone can still help by showing the time and location where they were last connected.\n\nSo yes, your AirPods need to be in the Bluetooth range and connected to one of your devices for them to be found. If they are out of range, Find My iPhone shows the the time and location of last connection, helping you to drill down to potential location.\n\nBasically this means\n\n\n*\n\n*If the AirPods are within range of any your devices you see the location of that device\n\n*If the AirPods are out of range, you see the location of the most recently connected device, at the time of the last connection\n\n", "Q: Command/Control keys are split on PC keyboard with Mac No matter how many combinations I try in Modifier Keys, unfortunately the control/command keys split responsibilities.\nFor example:\nControl x, c, v all work fine, but Control z, t, r don't work - instead i have to use Command z, t, r. \nIs there a way to have one of these buttons for all shortcuts?

These work to varying levels that depends on if the disk space has been written over. Disk Drill, TestDisk for Mac, and others are included in a reference given at this link of the best free data recovery packages in 2020. Most packages like this are not cheap so a free one is maybe the best bet.\nNot included in the list are EasyUs, Stellar Data Recovery and Recoverit. These are commercial packages and are not free although they may have free trial versions.\nYou have to decide for yourself which one sounds best. The only one I've used is the free trial version of Stellar Data Recovery. It worked ok finding some of my deleted files.\n\nA: Assuming that the affected disk hasn't been wiped, so that we can still work with it, let's get some more info about the disk's structures, since the output provided by fsck_apfs that you saw in Disk Utility isn't particularly helpful. We need to know more about the role of the malformed object with OID 0x148d6d that is mentioned in the output.\nPlease download and compile apfs-inspect, then run it on your affected disk so that we can get a better idea of what's going on under the hood. Assuming that the output from diskutil is the same as that in your question, this is done with sudo apfs-inspect /dev/disk2s2 or sudo apfs-inspect /dev/disk3.

Is there a way to extract the file from iTunes and save the m4v file to my external drive but also leaving it in iTunes.\n\nA: You would need an application which is capable of breaking Apple's DRM on the file, which may be illegal in some areas.\nNoteBurner M4V Converter Plus for Mac is one such option; however, it does not work on macOS 13 and later, nor on versions of iTunes after 12.8.\nThere are other such programs which claim to remove DRM from iTunes movies, but I have not used any of them and cannot say if or how well they work.\nAlso of note: iTunes does not allow downloading of 4K content, only streaming. As with the transition from DVD to Blu-Ray, the studios have taken the opportunity for higher quality to also be \"protected\" by much more restrictive DRM.\nWhile Keeping the DRM Intact\njmh added:\n\nI'm not interested in breaking Apples DRM. Can't I copy a movie and play it on my iMac without using iTunes?\n\nAh, well that's something else. Sorry I misunderstood.\nYou can copy the movie out of iTunes, but then you'll have two copies of the file, which could take up 4GB, or maybe even more. However, once you have it outside of iTunes, you can play the file, but only in QuickTime (due to the DRM).\nA better alternative might be to create an alias or link to the original file in the iTunes folder.\nAssuming that it's located in the usual place (~/Music/) then you could do something like this:\nfind ~/Music/ -ipath '*/iTunes Media/Movies/*' -type f -iname \\*.m4v -print \\\n| while read line\ndo\n\n    ln -s \"$line\" \"$HOME/Desktop\"\n\ndone\n\nThat will create a link from each movie file inside the \"Movies\" folder inside the \"iTunes Media\" folder to the ~/Desktop/ and won't take up any more actual diskspace.\nOnce they are linked to the Desktop, you can move the links somewhere else, rename them, etc.\nIf you don't care about the disk space, you can copy them instead of linking them:\nfind ~/Music/ -ipath '*/iTunes Media/Movies/*' -type f -iname \\*.m4v -print \\\n| while read line\ndo\n\n    cp -vn \"$line\" \"$HOME/Desktop\"\n\ndone\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro disk utility - disk0s2 not mounted I am trying to erase all data from my laptop and reinstall OS X before I trade in.\nI erased all data on Macintosh HD but now when I go to reinstall OS X there is no hard drive appearing when prompted to select a hard drive to install OS X.

I am using Mojave, and I am able to add a printer using lpadmin.  I can then print a test page to that printer using the CUPS web interface.  Additionally, the printer is listed with lpstat -p.  However, the printer does not appear in the Printers & Scanners preferences pane, so it is inaccessible from other applications.\nHere is the lpadmin command I am using:\n\nlpadmin -p MyPrinter -E -v lptone:/path/to/file\n\nThis printer is using a custom CUPS backend (lptone) that is a script that generates a file name using a UUID and then writes the printed content into that file, so the /path/to/file portion of the URI is ignored.

Is this possible? The below script does work––if I hardcode the delay time.\n\nPreamble/disclaimer:\n▸ \"active\" is a vague term that has more than one meaning: I interpreted first to mean \"focussed\", then to mean \"frontmost\", and then to mean \"exists\"; but running your script up to the point where it creates a new movie recording, it turns out that the window created is immediately focussed, immediately frontmost, and, of course, it necessarily exists.\n▸ It's not clear why you point out that you \"hardcode\" the delay time: was this because you would prefer to set the delay at run time, which implies being able to predict its value ahead of time; or was it because you don't want to use a delay at all, which would be a shame because that's exactly the way to do it (illustrated below).\nThe perceived problem\nLooking through your script and testing it on my Macbook, it appears what you're wanting to set the size and position of the window that is created for the new movie recording, but finding that AppleScript will set these properties before the window is fully initialised (into a state where it is ready to record), during which time QuickTime resizes the window to accommodate the input source, thus \"undoing\" your adjustments.\nYour script, as it is, doesn't in fact work, as it tests for the window's existence before advancing the script, and, as mentioned above in my preamble, the window exists immediately, which is to say that it gets created before it gets fully initialised (which is actually a really stupid thing for Apple to have done).  Therefore, when I ran it on my system, the issue described above is annoyingly persistent.\nSo, to me, the problem seems to how to workaround this jarring behaviour of seeing a window created one size, then grow, then shrink, and then grow again. \n Ideally, if it were me, I would like the window to just appear, set at the size and position of my choosing.\nAssuming this describes your objective too, then...\nSuggested solution\nNB. If you just need to know the time, and not especially how the clock works, skip to the end where there's a script.  But, if you encounter any problems, do read the instruction manual before picking up the phone.\nFirstly, we're not going to use System Events to adjust the frame of a window in an application that is scriptable, because scriptable applications provide a means to do this already, using the bounds property of a window object.  It is a four-item list of integers that equate to the coordinates of the window's top-left and its bottom-right corners.  Thus, if you wish to set the size of some window to {w, h} and position its top-left corner at coordinates {x, y}, you would do this:\nset the bounds of some window to {x, y, x + w, y + h}\n\nSecondly, there's no point hinging our script's delay time on a window's existence, because it will already exist on most systems.  If, on your system, you do find that an error is thrown when you reference the window of the new movie recording that tells you it can't find that particular window, i.e. error \"QuickTime Player got an error: Can’t get window \\\"Movie Recording\\\".\" number -1728 from window \"Movie Recording\", then you indeed do need to test for its existence.  Remember, however, this only that its properties are now gettable and settable, but not that this is the appropriate time to get and/or set them.\nTherefore, thirdly, we need a new condition to test for that reliable tells us that we can adjust the window's properties and be confident QuickTime is done re-adjusting them itself, i.e. how can we tell that the window is done initialising ?\nThe answer to that is discovered like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Retrieve all the properties of the window and its document immediately after creating a new movie recording;\n\n*Instigate a delay of any length, but one that's definitely long enough to give the window time to initialise fully, like delay 5 or delay 10 (depending on your patience);\n\n*Retrieve all the properties of the window and its document a second time;\n\n*Compare.\nOnly two properties change between the times before and after the window's initialisation: the bounds property of the window (obviously, since this is what's annoying us); and the natural dimensions property of its document.\nWe can't reliably use the bounds property of the window because we won't know its initial or final values (either one alone would have been suitable for a viable test).  Thankfully, natural dimensions happens to sounds like a property that is probably size-related.  As it turns out, it's an extremely helpful size-related property: it doesn't tell us what the size of the window is at any point, but it does tell us the pixel resolution of the document's video input source.\nIf you wonder what QuickTime is doing that takes it so long to initialise a window...  It's looking for, and then loading, the feed from the video input source.  Therefore, when it first creates the window, the value of the document's natural dimensions is set at {0, 0}, i.e. there is no input source at present.  After everything is done and the movie is ready to record, it sets the natural dimensions to its final value.\nThis is when you know it's a good time to adjust the bounds of the window.\nHowever...  This only eliminates one of the two jarring window resizes.  The solution to get rid of something you don't want on your screen is to hide it from view, or better still, make sure it doesn't appear on your screen in the first place.\nThere are three ways to open an application with AppleScript, and none of them involve a call to do shell script \"open ...\":\n\n\n*\n\n*activate: This is the command everyone knows, because it's the one everyone uses, and so it's pervasive, and common, but this rarely means something is the best.  It opens an application if it isn't already open, makes it the frontmost application, bringing it into focus.  With some applications, it also triggers either a new window to be created if one doesn't exist already (some browsers, for example), or an \"Open...\" dialog to let you pick a document on your computer to open, if one isn't already (TextEdit, Preview, etc.).\n\n*launch: This command is underused because many people aren't aware that an application doesn't need to be at the front in order to accept AppleScript commands.  It opens an application, and places it and its windows on the desktop, but not at the front, and it doesn't steal focus.  This means that, whatever application one is currently working in will not get disturbed.\n\n*run: This is a command that, in fairness, isn't suitable for all applications, and for those that it is, is often called implicitly without the scripter realising.  That's because its purpose is to open an application without physical cues; in fact, if your dock doesn't have the indicator marking running applications, there would be zero visual trace of the application at all.  It opens, but in the background.  It's not frontmost, it's not focussed, it's not visible, which means its windows are hidden.  But most Apple applications don't need to be visible to be scripted.  However, if the application is already running and this command is called explicitly, it makes the application visible (but not frontmost).\nTherefore, assuming that you are opening QuickTime where it wasn't previously running, this script implements all of the above:\nproperty position : {1087, 497}\nproperty size : {350, 621}\n\ntell application \"QuickTime Player\"\n    # if it is running then quit\n\n    set doc to new movie recording\n    repeat until doc's natural dimensions ≠ {0, 0}\n        delay 0.5\n    end repeat\n\n    set win to the first window where its document = doc\n    set {{x, y}, {w, h}} to {position, my size}\n    set win's bounds to {x, y, x + w, y + h}\n\n    activate\nend tell\n\nYES, there is a use of the delay command.  It's needed but it's not random: it's set to a minimal value purely to slow the rate at which AppleScript re-checks the natural dimensions property, which is a far cry from simply \"guesstimating\" a fixed delay that many people like to do in their scripts.\nYou will also notice it doesn't seem to use the run command I mentioned.  But hopefully, you recall that it can also get invoked implicitly, and this is one of those times: if QuickTime isn't already running, then simply starting the script with new movie recording will have stuff initialising in the background.  It becomes visible by sending the activate command (but don't forget, this isn't necessary, even for the actual recording and saving processes, so it's entirely possible to do a full screen recording, save it to a file, and close QuickTime without ever having to see that it was even open).\nThe line commented out is an optional extra to cater for instances where QuickTime is already open.  In that situation, even if it wasn't visible previously, the implicit run call will make the program visible.  However, quitting the application first, then running it will keep it incognito, providing there are no open documents that first need saving.\n\nI really hope that's what you were after, because that was a long answer for me to write, and a long one for you to read (sorry about that).\n", "Q: How can I prevent line numbers from appearing in .bash_history?

(i.e. clicking through the \"show details\" buttons and entering my password), but this doesn't always work, and is pretty inconvenient besides.\nI've also tried the other answers from that question, but these do not work. This is perhaps not surprising as that question refers to development work which involves self-generated SSL certificates, and my situation doesn't involve these.\nI've also tried turning off antivirus software (insert scare quotes as you like), and that didn't help. \nNote: When I look at the certificates on the problematic sites, I see the site's certificate but it's underneath a certificate issued by my workplace, and the browser shows my workplace's certificate as \"Untrusted\". I don't know how certificates work, but I'm guessing this is the problem and what I need to do is somehow make my browsers trust my workplace's certificates. \nAny suggestions for working around this problem?\n\nA: This is not a purely Apple-related question, but it's worth to reply.\nTL;DR: You should go to your company's IT Security Department immediately because the certificates that encrypt your web traffic can be compromised.\nLong story, your company uses a kind of proxy called \"Transparent proxy\" for SSL traffic. This consists of a proxy that the user doesn't have to authenticate or configure him/herself, with the addition of a SSL certificate issued by your company that replaces all the HTTPS certificates of the servers you are trying to connect to.\nThis is, effectively, considered as a Self-Signed certificate by your browser, and is actually making your company able to decrypt and inspect all your web traffic (TIP: stop facebooking at work =) ) . As \"out-of-the-box\" web browsers do not distinguish between these IT configurations from proper, evil man in the middle attacks, they present you such a warning.\nIn order to get rid of the warning, the companies' IT Departments install their Certification Authority Certificate, or \"certificate issuer's\" Certificate, in the computers' KeyChain. Secondly, they mark the CA certificates as ultimately trusted system-wide, so that the browsers recongise that situation as expected when they validate the SSL proxy certificate.\nSo, if you got back that warning it is because that trust chain of certificate validation initially set up by your company is, somehow, broken. From best to worst scenario, it can be because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your company's proxy certificate has expired and they have to replace it\n\n*Your computer has lost the CA certificate of your company, or it has expired, and they have to install a new one. Or a maintenance task just lost the trust settings for the certificate.\n\n\nFor these two above, better to check with IT for them to review all the settings. Do not take the risk of changing that trust yourself, as it would make you accountable if something further breaks... and you don't want to be accountable for a security breach.\nWorse scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your company proxy has been hacked and the certificate has been replaced by an adversary's certificate. \n\n*Your company traffic is proxied through another (an adversary's) proxy, that is to say, you are suffering a (very clumsy) Man in The Middle Attack\n\n\nNormally, in these kind of attacks, the computers have to be malware-infected for that malware to install the adversary CA into the KeyChain; otherwise all the computers would issue such a warning.\n", "Q: Is there a free and downloadable single-file version of the iPhone XR or iOS 12 guide?

How? Like the title says \nGot a iPhone/ a pc (w10) without iTunes/WiFi- need to transfer files (photos,zip,exe) from iPhone to pc. How? \nGot usb cable and acces to WiFi on phone.\nWould be very grateful if someone come up with something. I’ can’t find a solution \n\nA: Here is how to transfer your photos to the pc. The charging cable serves both as a charging cable and a data transfer cable.  Disconnect the cable from the power adapter.  Plug the usb end into your computer.  Plug the other end into your phone. You should see the phone as a new device. It will appear as a photo card. You need to drill down until you see your photos. \nSecurity restrictions have gotten tighter on the iPhone over time.

The wifi signal is not what it used to be, meaning the signal never dropped or loaded blank pages. Have tried Google Chrome and Firefox but both exhibit slow loading pages. I\nwas wondering if anyone knew of an upgrade for the airport card? \n\nA: The airport card is usually pretty stable.  You may want to start with the wireless router / air port.  You can pick one up at your local store and return it if it does not fix the problem.  As for the card itself it's replaceable but not really upgradeable from a quick google search.  If you have a free USB port you can use a Wireless AC USB adaptor like this... https://www.amazon.com/Edimax-Adapter-Supports-MU-MIMO-EW-7822ULC/dp/B01MY7PL10?tag=macworld05-20&ascsubtag=US-002-3187363-001-1437949-web-20\n\nA: I suggest you do some testing before assuming it's the wifi connection.

This is a very simple question but the answer is important for me. For example, by default, will people under 17 be able to download an app whose age rating is +17?\nIs it just a warning? Is it only forbidden to download with parental control or something?\nI would be glad to know if someone can help me out.\n\nA: https://www.bewebsmart.com/ipod-ipad-iphone/how-to-restrict-apps-by-rating/ \nIf Parental Control restricts a certain age criteria, yes it can be a filter.

The partition for time machine will be as safe from malware as if it were on a separate drive. However, you still should not use a partition for your Time Machine backup drive.\nLong answer\nAt the risk of oversimplifying things, partitioning a drive basically means you're splitting your disk so that your operating system sees them as separate drives. So, if you partition the drive into two and use one for your macOS installation and one for your Time Machine backup, then they're both being seen as two totally distinct drives and in this sense the drive is being dealt with as if it were an external drive.\nIn fact, doing this can actually offer an additional level of protection against malware because malware will usually infect your boot volume, rather than other drives/partitions. Of course, there is no guarantee against malware, and this does not offer full prevention or provide a cure.\nHowever, you should not partition your drive for Time Machine purposes!\nBy partitioning a drive so that one partition is being used for Time Machine you're effectively providing yourself a false sense of security. The idea of a fully working and  current backup is to ensure you have a way to restore your data in the event of data loss, and the best way to do this is to have a backup on a totally separate physical drive.\nBelow is a list of some reasons why using a partition is a bad idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Mac is stolen and therefore your backup is also gone - i.e. you have no way of restoring your data now!\n\n*Your main drive starts to fail and since the Time Machine partition is also on the same physical drive, your backup is also at risk - i.e. some or all of your backup data may become unreadable\n\n*Your Mac is damaged and with it your backup is most likely impacted as well.\n\n\nAs a minimum you should be using at least one external drive for Time Machine, preferably one that is 3x the size of your internal drive. External drives do not cost a lot of money and they also provide the added benefit of being able to be stored away from your Mac at times you will not be using it for a while. For example, if you go away for a week you can take your external drive with you, or store it somewhere else, so that if your house burns down or your Mac gets stolen, you have still have your backup.\nMy recommendation for individual users\nWhenever I setup a backup regime I recommend the following approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase two external drives of equal size and at least 3x the capacity of the computer being backed up\n\n*Label these drives differently (e.g. TM Backup HD 1 and TM Backup HD 2)\n\n*Set both of these external drives as Time Machine backup drives\n\n*As both drives are set up with TM they are alternated whenever both drives are available\n\n*Once the initial backups are done, physically remove one of the external drives and take it 'offsite'*\n\n*On the same day each week, swap the drives over\n\n*The net result is that both hard drives will have backups in the order of one week on, one week off (but between them there is a full set of backups).\n\n\n* By offsite I mean your workplace, a shed in the back yard, a family member's/friend's place (assuming you trust them!). You could even store it in your car (but this would depend on your climate and where you 'garage' your car).\nBasically, the idea is that your offsite drive is somewhere that protects your data in the event your house burns down or you get robbed. My strong suggestion would be in a locked drawer at your workplace (unless you work at home). Most people's workplaces are air-conditioned, secure, and convenient.\nIMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT STORAGE\nRegardless of the 'offsite' location you choose to keep your hard drive, there are some key factors to keep in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always keep the drive safe from large magnetic fields!\n\n*Ensure the location has a temperature range between 10 degrees celsius (50 degrees fahrenheit) and 43 degrees celsius (110 degrees fahrenheit). So, keeping it in a car would usually not be a good idea.\n\n", "Q: How to Break up a Long Element List into multiple lines of code (Applescript) In applescript, how do I make this a multi-line/easy-to-read property list?\nset props to {target:\"Safari\", slideNo:2, propsUrl:\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/slideId/preview\", rewardsUrl:\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/slideId/preview\", coords:{posX:937, posY:497, sizeX:149, sizeY:262}}\n\nsomething (reasonably) pythonic like...\nset props to (\n{\n    target:\"Safari\", \n    slideNo:2, \n    propsUrl:\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/slideId/preview\",\n    rewardsUrl:\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/slideId/preview\", \n    coords:{posX:937, posY:497, sizeX:149, sizeY:262}\n }\n)\n\nIs this possible?

The \"standard\" way to configure custom resolution policies for specific domains is to create a /etc/resolver directory, and then put file(s) in it named for the domain(s) you want the policies applied to. See man 5 resolver and this web page for more info.\nIn you case, this would mean creating both /etc/resolver/example1.com and /etc/resolver/example2.com, both containing this:\nnameserver 198.35.23.2\nnameserver 198.32.56.32\n\nNote: I haven't tested this in a while, but I assume it still works.

Because of the unique scenario where Homebrew shouldn't be installed with sudo, and it requires both the return key to be pressed and the users password, it's become a tricky thing to figure out. I've spent a few hours on this and found other unanswered questions on StackExchange with no luck on getting it completely automated.\nMy code:\necho \"Password: \"\nread -s PASSWORD\necho $PASSWORD | /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\nThe echo skips the request to hit return but doesn't pass in the password because I'm missing the -S flag because I shouldn't include sudo when installing Homebrew.

Then I started creating snapshots regularly, and I can revert to a previous state whenever I messed up.\nAnother thing to note: before rebuilding the catalogs, first run a regular fsck. Usually if I do that I would end up with a successful rebuild, otherwise it will fail.\nIf you do not have a backup of any kind, you can preserve your history by creating a new sparse bundle, copy the backups.db folder over using Finder (first mounting the corrupt sparse bundle read-only), and backup to that new sparse bundle. Note that you may have to use tmutil inheritbackup and/or tmutil associatedisk to preserve the history.\n", "Q: Are the results of Apple Photos processing shared between my computers? I have a MacBook and and Mac mini with same Apple ID. My photo library size is 55,109 photos, 3,670 videos, 68 items.  photoanalysisd has been running for 7 days on my MacBook.  It doesn't appear to be running on the Mac mini.  On the Mac Mini, Photos.app is not running (and thus should not be pausing photoanalysisd). \n\n\n*\n\n*Do both computers share the analysis results, or does each computer repeat the analysis?\n\n*If the information is shared, is there a way I can coerce photoanalysisd to only process on the Mac mini, to make processing faster using the two computers? \n\nA: No. In general, all photo library generated metadata is not strictly shared from iCloud to iCloud on macOS Mojave 10.14 and iOS 12 but some of the overall categories / extracted data does sync. (So it’s pretty confusing / grey area at the moment)\nMost of the AI training models to identify photos by subject, finding faces, making memories run locally on each device and only after you name a face, save or customize a memory or make an album does that higher level data sync.  \nYou might need to erase the long running library and let it redownload or better, engage apple support for iCloud and give the engineers permission to look at the sync logs server side and submit some local diagnostics if the process can’t catch up. \nI’ve don’t that in the past to get excellent support and a precise fix. Sometimes the algorithm gets stuck and you need an assist rather than just restarting the OS or downloading a clean copy from iCloud to one Mac (assuming that Mac isn’t your “source of truth” or master copy of photos for you).\n", "Q: Is there a method to target an open Finder window from the \"Save\" dialog? In some ancient version of the Mac OS, I seem to recall that, while in a \"Save\" dialog, there was a way (or an extension which provided a way) to click on an open folder in the Finder in order to specify that directory as the save target. Does that functionality still exist?\nContext: I needed to save a new AppleScript (using Script Editor) into the ~/Library/Scripts directory and could not find a way to do it without manually navigating to the directory through multiple clicks. The dropdown menu in the \"Save\" dialog did not list the directory because I had not saved to it recently. The directory was open right next to the editor. I know about the accelerators to navigate to the top level directories but those don't help in this case.\n\nA: The specific software you are probably alluding to is Default Folder X - which even allows you to click through any intervening windows to return to a folder visibly open on the Finder desktop. It also has a pre-determined list of 'useful' places & a history list. I do consider it one of the indispensible utilities on Mac.\nAlternatively, macOS itself allows you to drag any visible folder onto a file-picker dialog to send the dialog to that location.\nFullscreen apps may interrupt either of those efforts - but I have a particular set of reasons I absolutely never use fullscreen, so I'm not certain how it will respond.\n", "Q: Can the macOS Notification Center be made wider? When the text of a notification gets cut off, I keep wanting to make it wider so I can read more.\n\n\nA: I don't think this is possible on macOS. I looked for how developers deal with notification lengths and I found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6307748/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-push-notification-alert-text\nThe discussion mostly seems to imply that developers don't have any control over how the notifications are displayed, but rather just standards they have to conform to. Hope that helps!\n", "Q: What if I download a different IPSW for a different Device? I've always been doing research on how to download a firmware for a different device. What i'm trying to say is: What will happen if I download a firmware that is not meant for my device? I downloaded the iPhone 4s iOS 6 IPSW to for my iPhone 6s. Will it not work? Will it brick the device? Will it still work anyway but will the display be stretched? No, i'm not trying to make a duplicate question, I just want to know is going to happen.\n\nA: Nothing is going to happen. It won't take the IPSW file and give an error, something like:\n\nThe iPhone \"name\" could not be restored\n\nYou should just get the iPhone 6s IPSW file. Another note: You can't get iOS 6 on an iPhone 6s. The lowest version is iOS 9 for iPhone 6s.\n", "Q: Possible to choose Screenshot output method with Keyboard Shortcut? The revised Screenshot utility in Mojave brings the handy option of choosing if the resulting Screenshot should be copied to the clipboard or saved as a file, or saved to email, etc.\nHowever this requires that I first press Cmd+Shift+5 to bring up the options, then select my desired option using the pointer. I find myself often needing to switch between saving to a file and saving to the clipboard and wondering if there is a way to do this by a keyboard command or modifier. \nFor example it would be great if I could use Cmd+Shift+4 to capture a selection, but modify the command to save-to-clipboard or save-to-file.\nGrateful for any suggestions.\n\nA: It's already there…\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Screenshots\nBy default\n Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   4  will save as a file\n Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   Shift ⇧   4  will save to clipboard.\n\n", "Q: How do I prevent my MacBook Pro from dimming the screen on battery power? I sometimes work on my MBP in the car (from the passenger's seat, of course) and it is impossible to see anything unless the screen is on the maximum brightness.  Every few minutes, however, I have to repeatedly hit the F2 key to bump up the brightness because (apparently, at least) macOS thinks it knows better than I do what my brightness should be.\nI normally have my Energy Saver settings set to NOT turn off UNTIL 15 minutes.  But instead it turns WAY down in about 60 seconds, which (over time) becomes absolutely infuriating.  \nEven if I disable every possible power saving setting while on battery power, macOS still insists on doing as it pleases and ignoring my express commands.  How can I prevent it from constantly dimming the screen, so I can actually see what's on my display?\nSo even with the following settings, the screen dims:\n\n\n*\n\n*NEVER turn off display\n\n*DO NOT put hard disks to sleep when possible\n\n*DO NOT slightly dim the display on battery power\n\n*DO NOT enable power nap while on battery power\n\n\nIn case that is not enough detail, here is the output of pmset -g:\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n lidwake              0\n autopoweroff         0\n standbydelayhigh     10800\n autopoweroffdelay    0\n proximitywake        0\n standby              1\n standbydelaylow      10800\n ttyskeepawake        0\n hibernatemode        3\n gpuswitch            2\n powernap             0\n hibernatefile        /private/var/vm/sleepimage\n highstandbythreshold 50\n displaysleep         0\n sleep                0\n tcpkeepalive         1\n halfdim              1\n acwake               0\n disksleep            10\n\nCould some third-party utility be doing this?  If so, which one?  Or is this the work of macOS?  If so, how do I prevent it from doing this?\n\nA: Have you tried turning off auto-brightness on your Mac? That could be why it keeps adjusting the brightness by itself after a while (i.e., its ambient sensor thinks your display should be a different brightness and changes accordingly)\nHere's a tutorial on how to turn auto-brightness off: https://www.techjunkie.com/disable-auto-brightness-mac/\nI hope that helps!\n\nA: Just figured this out for my case. I had already disabled the brightness from automatically adjusting. Every time my computer woke up from sleep however the brightness would drop to around 50%.\nTurns out I also needed uncheck the box to \"Slightly dim the display while on battery power\"\nSystem Preferences > Battery > Slightly dim the display while on battery power\nSee the image below:\n\n\nA: I had to disable \"Low power mode\" both for \"Battery\" and \"Power Adapter\" before mine stopped dimming.\n\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to block email tracking services on Apple's Mail app OTHER than blocking all remote images?

I work in an industry context where I deal with numerous promoters who all love to include click tracking software on their emails (both for opening message/links), for example via MailChimp, Constant Contact, or YAMM.\nDoing some preliminary research online, practically every solution within Apple's Mail is just to disable remote image loading. This isn't a convenient option for me as I'm dealing constantly with emails where I need to see information contained in formatted images etc.\nAre there other solutions, extensions, hacks, anything to help block other parties' tracking services? \nIn Gmail there are very capable browser extensions, but I'd like to keep everything in Apple Mail if possible. \n\nA: I don't have an answer to your question. However I do have information that relates to this issue. \nEven though you might have images turned off on your mail, apparently Spotlight follows the urls during the indexing process, which negates the advantages of having the images turned off. \nSo, you might want to turn off spotlight indexing of your mail. :( \nLink below.\nhttps://lifehacker.com/disable-email-search-in-spotlight-to-avoid-message-trac-1678528323\n", "Q: MacBook Air Sierra install fail: Couldn't mount base system dmg!

How do I proceed?\n\nA: In my opinion the error message is misleading. Probably it's the same broken certification chain (as in this question & answer: El Capitan bootable installer on Mac Mini - “A required download is missing”) resulting in a slightly different message.\nSo download Sierra, open the dmg and the included pkg and install the Sierra installer.app to /Applications.\nFrom there create a new installer thumb drive with:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nReplace MyVolume with the name of your freshly erased thumb drive volume (probably \"Untitled\").\nBoot to the thumb drive and install Sierra.\n\nA: This sucks when it happens I know. I've had this happen when creating a USB installer from a Mac OS DMG that was downloaded with Safari. Before we start you need to MAKE SURE you are creating an installer USB from a Mac OS Sierra installer that is around 5.2GB. If you are trying to do it from one downloaded from the App store that is smaller than that then you are downloading an incomplete installer meant to be used only for upgrading within the Operating system (i.e. clicking on it in the Applications folder to install)\nHere is a link on how to download the actual \"Full\" installer:\nhttps://mycyberuniverse.com/macos/how-download-complete-macos-high-sierra-installer-app.html\nSo to continue. For some reason safari treats certain files differently especially iPhone firmware but also in some cases Mac OS dmg's. Don't ask me why because I can't remember the info since it was so long ago when I read it. \n Download the DMG with Firefox or Chrome and then Recreate the Installer USB.  Stuff happens and DMG's get corrupted so my \"go to\" when creating a USB installer and things go wrong is to redownload the DMG and don't use Safari.  Once you've rooted out that the DMG is good then you can move on to all the other helpful suggestions.  Good luck! Oh and once you get that installer working HIDE IT FOR NEXT TIME SO THAT YOU DON'T ERASE IT HA HA!\nIf you have a working Mac and you aren't Terminal Savvy then just use DiskMaker X to create the bootable USB installer.\n", "Q: How to configure a non-Safari browser as default on a jailbroken iPhone XR? How can I set a non-Safari web browser (such as Firefox) as default on a jailbroken iPhone XR, preferably deleting Safari?\n\nA: You can use the BrowserDefault tweak:\n\n\n*\n\n* BrowserDefault\nUnfortunately, there is no way to delete Safari as it is required by the OS.\n", "Q: How do you update the default version of Nano on MacOS X without using the homebrew package manager? I did do some research to check for installation methods but I primarily came across the homebrew method, and I didn't actually see any information about a binary download for Mac. The binary on the nano website is only for Linux.\nHowever, I want to update the version of the nano that is bundled with my Mac, located in the /usr/bin folder. Is it safe to directly paste the Linux nano binary into the aforementioned folder?\nIf my lack of knowledge is showing through my summary of the information please let me know.\n\nA: Recent Macs ship with GNU nano version 2.0.6, which is a far cry from the latest version 4.3.\nGNU nano is written in C and thus very easy to build from source. To do this, try the steps below that are reproduced from the README file that is included in the source code which you can find here:\n\n\n*\n\n*curl -O  https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v4/nano-4.3.tar.gz\n\n*tar xvzf nano-4.3.tar.gz\n\n*cd nano-4.3\n\n*./configure\n\n*make\n\n*make install\nYou should then have an up to date version of the binary. This does not replace the nano that ships with macOS - but it allows you to have one you can patch faster (or to a different level) than Apple updates it. You will have to make sure you add the path to the nano above to your path before /usr/bin/nano is in the $PATH\nMany people like https://brew.sh since it fixes your path and then installs nano and other tools correctly so they run before the system versions.\n\nA: Best bet here is to use Homebrew to install the latest version.\nbrew install nano\n\nThis will install nano to /usr/local/bin/nano.\nNext you will need to modify your .zshrc or .bash_profile (depending on what your shell is) to make sure you use this rather than the native variant.\nAdd the line:\nalias nano=\"/usr/local/bin/nano\"\n\n(Restart your Terminal app for this to take effect.)\n", "Q: Is there anyway to set up more than one do not disturb schedule on iPhone? I would like to have it so my phone has do not disturb on at night, and then have it turn on later in the day as well. As far as I know, you can only set up one schedule in settings. Is there an app/something else that would allow me to do this?\n\nA: You could use bedtime in DND for night and the scheduled DND for the daytime. See in Do Not Disturb settings -> Scheduled for enabling Bedtime and then go to clock app for setting its time. This solves night. For day, use the scheduled feature. \n\nA: You can set bed time, DND(Do not disturb) and downtime (under screen time) so that you only receive notifications at three intervals a day.\n", "Q: What are the dangers of running Flash on Mac? I've heard a lot of articles say how bad Flash is, but what can it actually do? I've played browser games that use Flash in Chrome, and now Firefox. I know I have a real version of Flash, and I haven't ever noticed anything suspicious on my computer. What can Flash do just by being run? (My Flash is up to date, but I've been using it for years, so I've used different versions at different times). \nIs there anything specific I should look for? (MacBook running latest version of Mojave)\n\nA: While it's a bit dated, the below linked document may help address your question. This letter titled Thoughts on Flash was written by Steve Jobs in April 2010. While it was written to address why iOS doesn't support Adobe Flash, few points are also relevant for reliability, security and performance on macOS. I have quoted them below:\n\nSymantec recently highlighted Flash for having one of the worst security records in 2009. We also know first hand that Flash is the number one reason Macs crash. We have been working with Adobe to fix these problems, but they have persisted for several years now.\n\nAs stated by Apple, security and reliability concerns, and availability of open and standards compliant alternatives have propelled them to discourage use of Flash. Flash still continues to be available for macOS for those who need it.\n", "Q: Make GIF element in Shortcuts crashes shortcut I’ve created a shortcut which should make GIF out of burst image but when I run a shortcut it crashes and doesn’t make GIF.

Many thanks\n\nA: As recovery mode is not available on that Mac, your best bet might be to restore with whatever you can any way you can, Then...\nOnce the Mac is up and running, download a version of macOS that will run on that Mac. Just the installer, don't run it just leave it in /Applications. If it STARTS to install just quit the installer. \nThen use a utility like DiskmakerX to create a bootable installer on an 8GB flash drive.

After all, the idea of a fully working and current backup is to ensure you have a way to restore your data in the event of data loss, and the best way to do this is to have a full backup on a totally separate physical drive.\nSo, I would purchase an external hard drive that is at least 3x the size of your internal drive and set this up as your Time Machine drive. Preferably you'd purchase one that is more than 3x the size so that you can also back up whatever you need to from your other external hard drive.\nI know this is not what you're actually asking for in terms of how you achieve you ultimate goal, but it really is the best option. External drives are not expensive and the peace of mind it'll provide is well worth the effort. And, after the initial backup (which may take some hours to do), each subsequent backup won't take too long and you won't have to manually do it (meaning you don't risk forgetting to do it).\nPlus, it's very simple to use your Time Machine backup in the event of having to restore your data after a system failure or when migrating to a new Mac.\n", "Q: Allow Shell Script to Access Protected Library Folders (launchd) I'm trying a bash script that works fine when run from the command line (Terminal).\nApart from the shebang, it just has:\nls -alt /Users/<username>/Libary/Mail/V6/.../Lists.mbox\n\n(Using ls as a simple command to illustrate the problem.)\nHowever, when I try a test run using launchd (which I set up using the Lingon X app) I get a permissions error.\n1: Operation not permitted\nls: Lists.mbox: Operation not permitted\n\nTerminal and Lingon X both have Full Disk Access allowed in Privacy pref pane, but I don't see any way to allow an individual shell script to be given such access.\nI've tried running the same script using AppleScript's do shell script but I get the same error.\nThe (.sh) script permissions are set to 755, so this should not be a factor.\nHow can I get around this please? \n\nA: I overcame the issue by creating an application wrapper for the script using Platypus - https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus.\nI gave the resultant app Full Disk Access in the Privacy pref pane and this allowed it to run.\n(Any subsequent change to the core script means regenerating the app and removing and re-adding it in Privacy as the new file is not recognised as having Full Disk Access.)\n", "Q: Where is system.log in TimeMachine backup I would like to get older versions of /private/var/log/system.log files from TimeMachine.

My mobile phone and data plans are with Ting, a US-based mobile virtual network operator that uses the framework of the US-based Sprint Corporation telecommunications company. I'm currently not in the US. I've turned on Airplane Mode, and then switched on Wi-Fi. The caption \"Sprint Wi-Fi\" appears on the top left of the screen, and I am able to access the Internet over Wi-Fi.\n\n\n*\n\n*How does my phone know to show the word \"Sprint\" in the caption? Does it read it off the SIM card, or does it get this information over Wi-Fi, or some combination of both?\n\n*If I discontinue my Ting/Sprint membership, and stop paying my monthly subscription fee, but keep the SIM card inside my phone, without ever turning off Airplane Mode, will the caption still read \"Sprint Wi-Fi\"? Will my phone continue to behave as before?\n\n*Are the answers to the questions above specific to Ting/Sprint, or will they remain true regardless of the mobile company I'm a member of (with the difference that, instead of \"Sprint Wi-Fi\", the caption \"XXX Wi-Fi\" will appear, where XXX is the actual mobile company)?\n\nA: The reason it says \"Sprint Wi-Fi\" at the top of the display is that you currently have \"Wi-Fi Calling\" enabled. This means that your calls and text messages are sent via Wi-Fi over the public internet to Sprint instead of being transferred via a cell signal. This is a helpful feature when you haven't got a cell signal, but have an internet connection over Wi-Fi.\n\n\n*\n\n*The word \"Sprint\" comes from the packet gateway that the phone connects to over Wi-Fi. It is not read off the SIM-card as such. Your provider Ting has a cooperation with Sprint to use the packet gateways of Sprint to enable this feature.\n\n*If you cancel your subscription with your provider, Wi-Fi Calling will also stop working. It doesn't matter if you're in AirPlane mode or not - when you try to place a call using Wi-Fi Calling it will be rejected by Ting/Sprint if you have cancelled your subscription. \n\n*These answers are not specific to Ting/Sprint, but are true for any cell provider that supports Wi-Fi Calling.\n", "Q: \"Hold for Authentication\" when printing through LP / LPR I have a Dell network printer mapped to my MAC. \nI'm able to print from applications without any issues, but when I try to print using terminal (lp or lpr), every file gets held up on the printer with \"Hold for authentication\" \nI'm able to enter my details for the printer and the job goes through, but I'm prompted every time I try to print using lp.

I've reinstalled office365 but this hasn't changed anything.\nAnyone any ideas on this ?\n\nA: Your delimiter in numbers is set to a 'space', so it reads spaces in the sentence as being cell delimiter. Hence, each word goes into a separate cell. You need to change the delimiter to a comma or a tab. Then only values separated this chacter will fill new cells. To change delimiter (taken from question):\n\nIn Numbers you can use any separator when importing csv tables.\nOn the format sidebar, in the table tab, look for adjust Import settings.

I've been reading about Android rooting and iOS jailbreaking. After Android rooting, it will not get any updates for the device. Is it the same with iOS? I mean after the jailbreak is it still able to get updates?\n\nA: A jailbreak is specific to a single iOS version or group of versions. You can always update your iOS device, but if you update to a version without a jailbreak available, you won't be able to jailbreak.\nFor example, the latest unc0ver jailbreak at the time of writing supports iOS 11.0 to 12.4. When iOS 13 is released, you will still be able to update your device to this version, but the jailbreak will not be available, since the system partition is reset. Then when a jailbreak is released for iOS 13 you can jailbreak once again.\n", "Q: LIGHTROOM: Missing files on ThunderBay Raid Drive after internal Hard Drive crash I'm looking for options and would appreciate any ideas. \nI'm a photographer w/a MacBook Pro & an OWC upgraded SSD internal drive that crashed. Lightroom is my main application and I use an OWC ThunderBay RAID drive as my main data hard drive (imports of images go directly here).\nUpon the abrupt crash of my Internal SSD HD, I used Carbon Copy Cloner to backup the HD  and restore* (some manual restoration was necessary), and then reformatted the internal drive. Upon reinstalling OS Mojave and Lightroom, I discovered to my horror that my catalog in Lightroom can't locate 80,000 of my images! (these are images that I know exist on the drive, as I was just using many of them).\nI'm thinking that this has something to do with my messy restoration (created a new user by accident) that is hiding folders and files via security permissions. Even though I've used Terminal to broadly change the drive's permissions etc... gone through folder by folder... there are still these thousands of important missing and I believe \"hidden\" files.\nLooking for suggestions... I am really in a dilly of a pickle. (-Flandersism\n\nA: Lightroom doesn't store images in the Lightroom catalog, it only stores the editing metadata. If Lightroom can not locate the images, they may be missing (!) or simply not where Lightroom is expecting them. The first step is to manually locate your images to confirm they are still in place on your harddrive (or wherever you had them). If the images are NOT where you expect them, and you can not find them manually, you may have lost or destroyed the images.  Lightroom can not help recover the images, as it does not store the images in the catalog.\nBut if you find the images, then perhaps the Lightroom catalog has lost track of them, or they are in a renamed location (you changed the user name, which changes the top level directory in MacOS). The first step is to look at the menu tree on the left in the Library module. If any images or folders are listed as \"missing' (with an exclamation mark: \"!\"), then inspect them to see what folder/drive they are attempting to connect to.

Since a week or two I am experiencing a very strange problem on my MacBook Pro running macOS 10.14.6 Mojave. (Build 18G103)\nNo matter what I'm doing, typing something in a browser or text editor or other application, watching a video on youtube or in VLC, every few minutes the whole system become non-responsive for like 1 or 2 seconds.\nWhen the machine is \"stunned\":\n\n*\n\n*The keyboard does not respond to typing in any app\n\n\n*video playback stops no matter which app or browser\n\n\n*mouse clicks don't register\n\n\n*cursor movement does work and respond\n\n\n*any sound that is playing, keeps on playing normally.\nWhen I was typing something, the letters don't appear, but after 1-2 sec when the system continues, the letters still appear as if they were cached somehow.\nThis persists across reboots, activity monitor shows no fancy stuff taking CPU in the background. I did not recently install any particular new software myself, other than just updates. It makes no difference if I have multiple apps running or only the one I'm using.\nIs there any way to find out what application or process is causing these short freezes, and preferably get rid of them?\n\nA: I've seen precisely this problem on many, many versions of macOS, both release and beta. Usually the delay is caused by some Apple process. For me, diagnosing is not the problem, the problem is fixing it.\nYou didn't say how much memory your computer has. A few years ago, Apple introduced compression on virtual memory. This is especially important in SSD-based computers: it decreases wear on the SSD to just compress memory, rather than sending it out to mass storage. But more and more programs are using more and more memory. So most of the freezes I've seen are related to long-running processes, typically Apple's processes used for things like curating photographs or background indexing of the SSD, waking up, having lots of memory decompressed, making the program you are using have its memory compressed, and then the scheduler changing its mine and giving your program memory.  One of the related problems is that the Mach process scheduler doesn't seem to be as memory and swapping aware as it should be.\nYour question is about how to diagnose this, so here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*First thing I do is set my system clock to count every second so I can always look up at the menu bar and see if the computer has crashed.\n\n*Next, I set up a program that does a ps aux every second and stores the result in another file.\n\n*I use the computer until it freezes. \n\n*Then I look at the relevant ps aux to see which process was taking up the most memory or the most CPU.\n\n\nIf you are pretty sure you have identified the process, you can STOP it without killing it. See if this makes the problem go away. \nOnce you've identified the culprit, you have a problem. It's typically an Apple process, not your own, not a third-party driver, not anything that you have control over. Here are some of the things I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user on your computer and try using it without copying over all of your files. Does the problem go away? If so, it's either that your profile is corrupted or, more likely, a file in your profile is causing the problem. Now you can slowly copy things into the new profile until you have identified the problem.\n\n*Sometimes I've found individual files that causes the full-text indexing program to blow up the amount of memory it needs or to crash. I delete those files and the problem goes away.\n\n*Sometimes I just wipe the computer and restore my files. That works.\nGood luck. This is annoying and it's almost certainly apple's fault.\n\nA: Does your Macbook have a physical HD or a SSD? In my experience, these sound like the symptoms of imminent HD failure: your computer is trying to read/write to disk, but it can't because the HD is accessing a bad sector and can't read/write to it, so everything freezes until the HD responds.\nIf you actually have a physical HD, the way to check this would be to check the SMART status. The \"standard\" way to do this would be using Disk Utility; unfortunately, it won't tell you much. In most OSes (Windows too), the OS-level tools to check on hard drives will just tell you \"SMART status: passed\"... right up to the moment the HD fails.\nIn my experience, the only reliable way to check the SMART status (including the most important stats: bad sectors, reallocated sectors...) in macOS is to use Homebrew to install \"smartmontools\", an Unix command-line program to check the SMART status of your HD. Forther details in this question:\nHow do I get detailed SMART disk information on OS X (Mavericks or later)\nIf you do this and see that stats like \"Uncorrectable Sector Count\" are higher than 0... backup your data immediately. And change the HD.\n\nA: Let's start with some basic troubleshooting steps and we'll see how far we get. \nThe first thing I would do now is test your MBP in Safe Mode. \nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Now use your MBP in Safe Mode until it starts showing the freezing symptom again or until you're satisfied it's not going to\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Once again, test to see if your MBP still freezes\n\n\nNow, if you find that your MBP:\n\n\n*\n\n*works fine while in Safe Mode, but not when booted normally, then it's likely to be a login item, corrupted font, or kernel extension). If so, read on further below.\n\n*still freezes, then it's time to skip ahead to resetting SMC, NVRAM and potentially testing your hardware. If so, let me know your exact model of MBP and I'll add the steps to this answer. \n\n\nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test to see if you can use your Mac without it freezing:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can, you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n", "Q: Stop finder from opening search by default I open finder with option + cmd + space. \nWhich on my second MBP opens a Finder Search window.

But if you go to iTerm2-> Preferences -> Profiles -> Session -> Configure Session, you can create a custom menu component with title as \\(rows) x \\(columns) and it will show the width. I know it's not the perfect solution but will do your job. \n\nMake sure your status bar enabled is checked.  \n", "Q: MacBook Air Early 2015 SSD > MacBook Pro Early 2013? BLUF: Can I use the SSD out of a MacBook Air in a MacBook Pro 13?\nI have a road worn but otherwise fine MacBook Pro 13\"/Early 2013. About a year ago it started having issues with crashes and hangs. I reformatted its drive and reinstalled macOS, which worked for a little while. But now that machine will not fully POST. It will boot, but almost immediately indicates that it can't find a startup disk. That indicates an SSD failure to me.\nI happen to have an Air, but I'd rather have the Pro up and running——so can I swap out the drives? Both were running identical versions of Mojave.\n\nA: Have you tried reverting to the original macOS that was shipped with this system? If you can reproduce the same behavior with Mavericks/Yosemite then you could very well confirm that this behavior is rooted in an SSD failure vs file system issue. \nThis blog post lists a number of issues as to why Mojave cannot find your hard disk, I would perform a systematic check before trying to swap out the hard disk.\n\nA: According to the information on everymac.com, the Early 2015 MacBook Air has a PCIe SSD while the Early 2013 MacBook Pro uses an SSD with a SATA interface. The everymac.com page implies that the Pro's SSD can be replaced with a 2.5in drive up to 7 mm thick. \nThis ought to mean that you could either look for a PCIe to SATA adapter to use the drive from the Air, or fit a standard 2.5in SATA SSD. However the Pro's SSD cable is not a standard SATA one so you would need a specific cable or adapter to do this and without spending too long on it I can't find any sign of one online.\nIf you don't mind booting the Pro off an external drive then you might be able to find an external USB housing to let you use the Air's SSD... but in that case you might as well just get an external USB SSD which lets you keep the Air in working order. If you really want the Pro working with an internal SSD then it looks like you'll have to spend the money on an SSD replacement for that model.\n", "Q: Re-enable startup chime on new Mac I want to hack my iMac's firmware - or maybe that's a stupid idea, but I got to the conclusion that that would be my only option. And please note that my knowledge of coding is at the level of writing applescripts and Filemaker solutions for my own use so I am way out of my league here. But here's the thing:\nI replaced my 2013 imac with a 2019 version and it has no startup chime. Why it was removed, and why it was not made an option, is one of those inane Apple mysteries. Clearly, a lot of people are lamenting this change. \nAfter researching the issue, I learned that the startup chime is embedded in the firmware. Thence came the idea. \nSo the question to those in the know: Would there be a way to put back the startup chime into my shiny new machine?\nThanks, and I'm sorry if it is the wrong forum, or if the question is unacceptable for using the word \"hacking\". I am NOT trying to achieve anything nefarious, just a solution for my own use. \nPS: I have been aware of the nonworking command line solution, I read it in this very website, I thought it was clear that I was looking for a DIFFERENT solution, involving the firmware, with some creative thinking.  This clearly can be done, Apple could do it if they wanted to, I'm sure some enterprising hacker could do it as well. I'll keep looking.\n\nA: It's not possible.\nFrom OSXDaily Where’s the Startup Boot Sound on New iMac & MacBook Pro?\n\nOne theory promoted online and originating from some web forums was\nthat you could re-enable the Mac startup chime sound effect by turning\nto the command line. The claim was that by launching Terminal app and\nentering the following command syntax:\nsudo nvram BootAudio=%01\n\nAnd another variation which you see online are the two:\nDisable the startup chime:\nsudo nvram BootAudio=%00\n\nEnable the startup chime:\nsudo nvram BootAudio=%0\n\nSupposedly, after executing that properly, the startup chime would be\nenabled on the Mac again.\nBut it turns out that nobody bothered to actually test this out,\nbecause it does not work.\n\n", "Q: iPhone 8 purchased through AT&T change to T-Mobile I was able to purchase an iPhone 8 through my company with AT&T being the carrier.

The battery is original and has never been replaced. I have had charging problems with it recently - I needed to wiggle the cable to get it to charge. I thought it was a bad cable.\nA couple of days ago, I let the phone discharge and turn off to calibrate the battery. I let it sit until today, when I tried to charge it. When I plugged it in, all it did was flash the low battery symbol with the lightning bolt and lightning cable (not the solid low battery symbol).\nI did blow into the lightning port to clean it out. The cable fits snugly, and the pins on the inside of the port are clean. There's no lint or anything in the port. I've tried a couple different cables and chargers (I tried a Linux computer, a MacBook Pro, a wall adapter, and three different cables), and they all do the same thing. iTunes did not detect the phone on the MacBook Pro.\nThe symbol reappears for a few seconds whenever the phone is disconnected, so I know the phone detects that it's plugged in.

Here are some photos:\n\n\nNote: I cross-posted this question on the official Apple community to (hopefully) get more answers.\n\nA: The problem you're having is that the battery has most likely died and a battery replacement is in order.\nAn iPhone 5s battery is rated at having a life expectancy of 500 cycles. It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; it's just an estimation of how long it can last. In your case, though, the battery would have had a much longer than average life and, unfortunately, your attempt to calibrate the battery may have been the nail in its coffin.\nThe only thing to try (if you haven't already) is leaving it plugged in for a while to see if the battery starts getting a charge. You should know after about an hour (maybe earlier) if that's going to work.\nOtherwise it really is the time for a new battery (or a new phone). Fortunately, if you want to have a go at replacing the battery yourself, this isn't too difficult for an iPhone 5s. See How to replace the battery in your iPhone 5s for more info.\nHowever, most people would opt to have it replaced professionally or to upgrade their phone when it's this old as you don't know what other components may fail in the not-too-distant future.\n\nA: you can try a \"hard reset\" of the phone:\nkeep the home button and the power/sleep button pressed for about 30 seconds while connected to a power supply.\n", "Q: How to create a pasting macro I'm a big fan of the ANSI keyboard layout, but since I'm located in Denmark, the layout is missing the three letters 'Æ', 'Ø' and 'Å'.\nI want to create three keyboard shortcuts that triggers a paste of one of these three letters into whatever text writing in.\nFrom my research, it has to be a paste event that triggers the writing of one of the letters.

I then use a fn key together with alt/opt (+ shift for CAPS) to write Æ, Ø and Å.\n\n\nA: You can use Text Replacement, built into the system.\nThe issue with needing to generate a single letter in the middle of a word is that the replacer generally wants you to hit a space or a period then a space before it will do the replacement. You also need the trigger to be something you wouldn't ordinarily type.\nSee System Prefs > Keyboard > Text\nFor instance, if you set your input to 'ae' & your output to 'Æ' then you would trigger every time you typed ae followed by a space… probably not very useful.\nSo, you generate with a mnemonic instead. I used §ae as it's easy to do that on my ISO keyboard; on ANSI you might pick `ae or ~ae or similar.\nThat, however, will still need you to generate a space afterwards, then backspace it - irritating.\nSo, this is the trick - the only downside is it will now take 5 key-presses to generate one character.\nSet your input to §ae..\n2 full-stops [periods] at the end.\nThat will let you trigger the replacement without having to enter a space, so you can use it in the middle of a word.\n\nBTW, you just copy/paste into the right-hand side, or double-click it from the Emoji & Symbols panel, if you can't make your keyboard naturally generate a character\n", "Q: Macbook pro wont turn on?

And, reading between the lines I'm assuming this is an older model MacBook which probably still has its original battery - and therefore at much greater risk of having a dead battery.\nYou could try powering the MacBook up while connected to AC power and without the battery installed (this was possible with some models), but otherwise you'll need to replaced your battery (something I would recommend even if you could power it up without the battery).\nFurther info\nMost MacBook batteries have a life expectancy at or around 1000 cycles.  It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; it's just an estimation of how long it can last.   \nYour options are to have the battery replaced or to only use it while connected to an AC power source (if this works for you). There are many 3rd party battery options available for purchase, so if you're still happy with your MacBook then that's your best option. If not, then it's time to upgrade.\nIf you do decide to replace the battery, then I would ensure that you purchase a battery from a reputable online store dealing with Apple products.\nFor example, the following are some well-regarded sites:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Sales \n\n*Simply Mac\n\n*RAM City\n\n*Macfixit\nBy buying from a reputable store you'll be sure to get a battery fit for purpose, regardless of manufacturer. Being reputable means they're only going to sell something that works and they'll stand behind the product they sell, regardless of the brand.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2013 no longer boots My MacBook Pro 2013 no longer boots.

The iPhone XR that I recently bought from Apple came with a thin folded plastic protector that covers both sides. (In what follows I call this the Apple protector.)\nI have also bought (again from Apple) a separate and (presumably) tougher screen protector, namely the Anti-Glare Screen Protection badged by Belkin; and I have bought a protective case made by Speck, the Presidio Grip, which is described as compatible with screen protectors.\nBefore I fit the case, should I fit the Belkin protector on top of the Apple protector, or the other way round? Or should I take the Apple protector off and keep it in the event that the Belkin protector gets damaged or mislaid in the future?

A couple of days ago I bought a new AOC I2475PXQU (1080p, 60Hz) and it doesn’t work: the laptop “sees” the monitor and creates a second desktop, however on the monitor I see the message “No signal” only. In some cases, the laptop freezes or spontaneously reboots when the monitor is connected or disconnected. When I change the image output settings to 1080i or 720p, sometimes the second desktop appears on the monitor (but in most cases I see the message “No signal” only). For some reason, the monitor is defined as I2475W1 in the system settings. I tried using a different cable with the same connectors, however this didn’t fix the issue. I performed a reset of NVRAM, PRAM and SMC — this didn’t help either. In addition, I performed Apple Hardware Test — there are no errors. Also, I connected other devices to this monitor using HDMI, and they worked perfectly.\nUpdate: According to the monitor menu, H. Frequency is 45 KHz at 720p and 34 KHz at 1080i; V. Frequency is 60 Hz at any settings. When other devices connected by HDMI, H. Frequency is 68 KHz and V. Frequency is 60 Hz.\nHow can I localize and fix the issue?

However, after enabling FileVault from an Administrator account, I saw that network users can't log in even after enabling: Display login window as Name and password. \nFirst I have to login with an admin account and then logout allows an only network user to login which is not an ideal solution. \nThere is some solution but what if I don't know the user and would like to make Mac machine open where random AD user can log in in that machine (FileVault enabled).\nAny suggestion or solution will be highly appreciated. \n\nA: I will explain this process very technically in details.\nWhen you have an encrypted disk with FileVault, the system needs to ask for an authorised user to login just after EFI boot. \nThis is necessary because the system has to mount the disk. And it can't mount it without an admin password input.\nYou then see a screen with local admin-level users avatars. \nThat screen shows some users avatar because that user's avatar were inserted on the EFI boot image/nvram. At this point of the boot sequence, there is no Operating System loaded yet, it's just a simple boot screen to ask the user password [which simulates the login screen appearance of the GUI], but it just a static image containing the user avatars! (almost like a kind of bootloader statical image, except it asks for user/pass combination)\nAfter you insert the password, the disk is mounted, and the boot process begins.\nAfter the loading bar reaches about 80% that screen changes to another almost identical, it sometimes blinks at this point. This is the GUI interface being loaded, process called WindowServer. \nAt this point the network interface is UP, other network subsystems are just started, including open directory services [which you need]. If the disk were NOT encrypted, this is the EXACT point where you would see the REAL login screen asking for username/password. But since the disk is encrypted and you have provided the user/pass to decrypt it earlier [before mounting the disk] it skips the real multiuser-mode login screen that should appear here and auto-logs the username you inserted before. \nSo in practice, it is just a mimic theatrical simulation of a real login since the boot, but it is fake, until when GUI is ready and then the MacOS does an auto-login once in multiuser mode, to make you think all was kind of  \"magical\". But there is no magic at all. \nSo what you need/want is impossible on that initial screen, because no network authentication protocol is up at that point. Even the disk isn't ready, which only becomes mounted and readable after inserting the user/pass combination.\n\nYou can take a better understanding of what I have written and how all this happens by booting it a little different: \nUse the -v nvram boot argument, to boot it verbosely.\nIf you boot it using the \"-v\" nvram argument you can get a better view of what is happening \"behind\" the scene, and also can see the GUI loading moment, and the auto-login happening.\n\nWhat has to be done:\nTo achieve what you need, we have to prevent the auto-login mechanism on the real GUI [windowServer] to happen. \nThis way you will have a local user just to mount the system-disk on Boot-time, then after GUI gets-up it must stay on the un-logged state, and showing the real login screen with the real avatars or fields to input user/password (depending on how you prefer to log users [by avatars or by text input name/pass]). \n\n\n*\n\n*This will force 2 logins:\n\n\n*\n\n*one for Filevault [on Boot] and \n\n*one for the OS\n\n\n*On the second login you can either login the same local user used on boot, or you can login any other user. \n\n*This will also let you login [on the second login] any AD user as you need to. \n(Remember that the first login is not a real login, it just an authentication to mount the disk, so nobody is technically logged-in on the UNIX/BSD [system portion] after mounting the disk. The Real/true login only happens on the second one [on the GUI portion])\n\nHow to do it:\nTo force 2 (two) logins there is a secret key to be added to MacOS configuration: \nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow DisableFDEAutoLogin -bool YES\n\nAfter executing it, reboot, and it is done!\n\nPlease post your results, I just tested it now on Encrypted El Capitan and it works!, and it should work up to Mojave (but I don't have any encrypted Mojave here\n  now to test it now. I will test and validate it also on Catalina tomorrow. If\n  you can, please validate it for your macOS version, post the results, and we can\n  build a mini-table here listing all known working versions later.\n\nExecuting the above command is completely safe, nothing to worry about it. \n", "Q: Weird message when I hit Send/recieve on Outlook on Mac Now this message has just had me confused for couple of days lately.

I have an early 2015 13\" Macbook pro with a 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 processor.\nI've been having some battery issues lately, that could be been attributed to charging my laptop and plugging in foreign USBs (I bought this iPhone 7 charging cable in Italy that doesn't seem to fit my macbook USB port very well, and it doesn't seem to allow my macbook to recognize the device, although it does allow it to charge) into my macbook pro when I was overseas back in July, or it could just be my battery is deteriorating (I have a 850 cycle count). \nThe first time I noticed issues was back in mid July when I was in Italy. Macbook battery bar showing as red; battery % jumps around; battery condition normal; out of US charging\nBut those issues were quickly resolved when I reset the SMC.\nLast week, I started getting a \"Service Battery\" warning on my macbook. I've tried resetting my SMC a few times, but the error remains, so it appears that my battery will soon reach its life expectancy. \nToday, I noticed that my macbook feels much hotter than usual. I'm not doing anything computationally expensive, so I have no idea why it's getting hot, and I'm wondering if it's connected to the battery issues I've experienced recently. I also checked activity monitor, and nothing appears abnormal. Below is the output from Macs Fan Control.\nAre the temperatures way too high? I don't know why its reporting 45C for the ambient temperature. It's about 86F (33C) in my house.\n\n\nA: Those temps seem fine to me. \nMBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load. CPU temps (just like ambient temperatures) typically have a bearing on GPU temps too, especially within the extremely confined spaces of a MacBook. \nIf you'd like, you can refer to the Intel Mac Temperature Database to see the various temperature ranges reported by users. You can also filter the list by model etc.\nAs for your battery, it's also clear that it needs replacing. MacBook Pro batteries have a life expectancy at or around 1000 cycles.  It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; as every user is different in terms of what they use their computers for and how/when they're using AC power etc. So the 1000 cycles is just an estimation of how long it can last. \nSince your battery needs replacing, it's not contributing as much to the overall power source mix for your MacBook Pro, so this could explain an increase in temperatures - although the increase could also be explained by other factors.\nAs an aside, the cable you bought in Italy is most likely a charge only cable (i.e. many of the cables sold at fuel stations etc only support charging and not data transfer), so that explains why this cable will charge your iPhone but not allow data transfer. Regardless, it's unlikely to affect the temperature of your MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: Turn on do not disturb for single app Is there a way to turn on do not disturb for a single app rather than all apps?\nSpecifically, I would like to mute notifications from Outlook for Mac for about an hour.\nIs it possible to do this in OSX natively, or alternatively through a third-party app?\n(I am running OS X Mojave, version 10.14.6)\n\nA: No - do not disturb is a system level function on macOS and iOS.\nWhat you’d need to do is make an AppleScript or other tool to automate disabling notifications for that app and then possible hook that up to a timer app or trigger (or just remind yourself to toggle it with a keyboard shortcut when your other manual timer goes off).\nSo a third party app on macOS clearly could do this, it’s just not been written (or covered widely enough to be found) since there’s no API to make that app easy to write.\n", "Q: Unable to use external monitor's full resolution using Macbook Pro I recently bought a new 2019 MacBook Pro.

I want to lock the monitor.\nI know I could go into system prefs and require a password after sleep, but I don't want to use a password every time I sleep my monitor.  That would drive me crazy.  I also know I could do something like this:\ndo shell script \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\"\n\nBut that suspends the current user's session, which prevents my remote from controlling my Mac.  I just want to lock my monitor (command control Q) without using a hotkey, so I'll be able to trigger it remotely.\nHow can I lock my Mac's screen remotely?\n\nA: I found an answer.\nThe Lock Screen app on Github does exactly what I wanted to do.  So, by downloading it and adding this to my script, I can lock my monitor remotely:\nrun application \"Lock Screen\"\n\nEdit: It seems the application runs the following script:\nactivate application \"SystemUIServer\"\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"SystemUIServer\" to keystroke \"q\" using {command down, control down}\nend tell\n\nAdding that to my applescript still gives me an osascript error, but triggering the Lock Screen app using applescript works perfectly for my needs.\nThis makes me happy!\nI have a remote at my door that I programmed to turn my lights on when I click the ON button, and when I click OFF, it turns my lights off, makes sure various smart devices are off, and it locks my Mac's monitor.\nIf I'm headed out the door, OFF makes sure everything is off and the Mac's monitor is locked.\nLove it!\n", "Q: Sending message from Terminal does not work when the Mac is sleeping I have a script that LaunchControl runs in the middle of the night to back up my database and send a message that it has been done. The message is sent as follows:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Messages\" to send \"backup completed\" to buddy \"admin\"'\n\nI am running macOS Mojave. This works fine if I test it during the day, but in the middle of the night it, the message is not sent even thought the backup occurs. Presumably it has something to do with the fact that my machine is asleep. How do I fix this?\n\nA: The Mac must be powered on to run your script. Only a few Apple specific processes are allowed to run via PowerNap.\npmset\nYou can use pmset to schedule your Mac to wake in the middle of the night.\n\npmset allows you to schedule system sleep, shutdown, wakeup and/or power on. \"schedule\" is for setting up one-time power events, and \"repeat\" is for setting up daily/weekly power on and power off events. Note that you may only have one pair of repeating events scheduled - a \"power on\" event and a \"power off\" event. For sleep cycling applications, pmset can schedule a \"relative\" wakeup or poweron to occur in seconds from the end of system sleep/shutdown, but this event cannot be cancelled and is inherently imprecise.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*type - one of sleep, wake, poweron, shutdown, wakeorpoweron \n  \n*date/time - \"MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss\" (in 24 hour format; must be in quotes) \n  \n*time - HH:mm:ss \n  \n*weekdays - a subset of MTWRFSU (\"M\" and \"MTWRF\" are valid strings) \n  \n*owner - a string describing the person or program who is scheduling this one-time power event (optional)\n  \n\nSee How to Power On Your Mac at a Specific Date and Time for more details, including a graphical approach, and alternative tools.\n", "Q: How to export Safari history to either Firefox or Chrome?

I’m working with a notation software and I would need to space certain graphical elements evenly within a predetermined space (e.g.: I set a 5cm space and I have 5 elements, they need to be precisely 1cm from each other), something that the software cannot do on its own (that is, without printing on paper, measuring, then moving the objects, then printing again and so on...).\nThe ideal solution would be to have a floating ruler on the screen or a superposed grid similar to millimetric paper that would still allow click-through (i.e.: interaction with the program below it).\nIs there an app that provides this tool?\nThank you very much \n\nA: iconfactory's xScope\n\n\nPowerful on-screen rulers for precise pixel measurements that include scaling, rotation, and edge snapping.\nxScope’s rulers can be used to measure any on-screen element, including the distance and angles between objects.

Test to see if you can use your Mac without it freezing:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can, you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\n", "Q: 2015 MBP shutdown/boot problems - \"X86PlatformPlugin Result 0\" messages I have a 2015 15\" MacBook Pro (full specs- i7, GPU, 1 TB) running latest Mojave. I have verbose mode enabled for shutdown/boot.\nBasically, shutdown and boot sometimes take minutes (occasionally five or more) - during that time the console just displays X86PlatformPlugin Result 0 messages over and over (and over).\nResetting the SMC tends to reduce the time, but it eventually starts to happen again.\nI'm trying to avoid having to do a complete wipe and install.\nAnyone have insight on what this message means and what is causing it?\n\nA: I've had this problem for 2 years across 3 different Macbook Pros. I think it has something to do with the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock. \nIf I unplug the dock during boot or shutdown, all those X86PlatformPlugin Result 0 messages go away and everything speeds up. \n[edit]\nI found the problem!\nI have a collection of OWC USB3-to-eSATA adapters. One (older Western Digital) drive enclosure is very fussy and apparently had a particular issue with one of the adapter-cable combinations. I swapped out the eSATA cable & adapter for a different set, rebooted the enclosure and viola, everything is happy again.\nMy theory is that this error at boot/shutdown is indicating an external hardware fault.\nThe troublesome device tree in my case is Mac > TB3 Dock > USB3 Hub > eSATA Adapter > WD Drive bay \nThis discovery was after I removed all the 3rd party extensions from my system on a brand new (1 day old) 2019 MBP to no avail.\nIt should be noted that the WD drive bay was powered down while all this trouble was happening, which suggests that there's still a keep-alive charge running for active sensing to detect plug-replug behaviour \n\nA: I also had this verbose message \"X86PlatformPlugin Result 0\". \nCulprit was Seagate external drive (Expansion Desktop Drive 4Tb, model SRD00F2).\nSeems impossible to fixit.

Would it work?\n\nA: It may work, but at the least, you won't be able to close it properly. The LVDS cable is similar, but not identical, so you may have some extra cable parts floating around inside the enclosure. Short answer: it may work, but it is definitely not recommended. The way the top case (display) connects is slightly different. The screws would fit in the correct spots, but because the display is of different depths, it would not close properly.\n", "Q: App Store message in Japanese - what does it mean? \nThat's the message that always keeps popping up when I'm trying to update my game.

I had an iPhone 6 and suddenly I would notice the rear case was very warm and the battery was being discharged at an excessive rate. I have an app called System Status Pro which shows CPU usage. When the issue occurred, the CPU usage was fluctuating around 20-30%. I left it thinking iOS was busy doing stuff, but the battery continued to discharge quickly (i.e. 100% to empty in an hour or so). I force restarted the phone and everything returned to normal. CPU usage averaging 3-5% with no apps running.\nThis issue continued to return randomly. I could last a week with no issue, then it would happen 3 times in one day.\nMy investigations so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*The issue is not related to my phone’s hardware. I upgraded to an iPhone 8 (restoring my phone’s from a backup) and the issue continued\n\n*The battery app in Settings, which shows each app’s CPU usage does not show a particular app causing the usage\n\n*Background app refresh is turned off\n\n*No obvious Apple services (i.e. iCloud backup) are running at the time of high CPU usage\n\n*When the issue occurs CPU usage is always 20-30%. Never more, never less\n\n*It is not iOS version specific\n\n*The phone is not hacked/jailbroken\n\n*The phone does not have Enterprise certificates installed (which would allow non-App Store approved apps)\n\n*High CPU usage continues with no apps running (double clicking home button shows no apps running)\n\n*The only resolution is to restart the phone and usually a single restart fixes it, although occasionally it returns and another restart is needed, sometimes even a third restart. But restarting always fixes it eventually\n\n*I have 15GB free of the phone’s 64GB storage\n\n*I realise I could wipe the phone. This is my last resort and I want to avoid this\n\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?\nDoes anyone know how I can view CPU usage at a more granular level, ideally identifying each individual processes CPU usage?\nMany thanks in advance for any advice!\n\nA: I finally found the issue!\nIt was an iPhone game called Minesweeper which runs as a widget in the Notification Center/Today View. I guess to be in the Notification Center/Today View as a widget, it has to be running, yet it was not listed as a running app when I double tapped the home button.\nI have no idea why Minseweeper was causing the high CPU or why it occurred randomly, but as soon as I deleted Minesweeper, the problem went away.\nThe only reason I discovered the cause of the problem was because I was in the Battery app in Settings and I happened to tap a section of the Battery Level graph and it showed app activity for that specific moment in time. Minesweeper was there at 30% usage and I hadn't run that game for months.\nI hope this solution helps someone somewhere!\n\nA: Photo Analysis / Classification\nAnother common issue with this, if you have photos stored on your device, is the photoanalysisd that scans your photos and processes them for searches. This provides the ability to search by, for example:\n\n*\n\n*faces (face detection requires scanning every photo)\n\n*objects (e.g. ‘dog’, ‘car’, ‘person’, ‘tree’)\nPresumably Apple updates / enhances these analysis routines from time to time; this may be one of the reasons a device is extra busy in the hours and days following installation of iOS updates.\nSince photoanalysisd operates on the device itself, it may operate regardless of whether someone uses ‘iCloud Photos’.\n\nContent Indexing\n‘Spotlight’/‘Siri’ indexing / reindexing can have similar effects. It is often noticeable for users who use the built-in iOS ‘Mail’ app and have many thousands of messages in their inboxes.\nThis can be disabled on a per-app basis in the ‘Siri’ section of the iOS settings app.\nThese indexes are also liable to be restructured (or rebuilt entirely) following iOS updates. (The iMessage database is also restructured often to support new features, but even with a very large message archive, this likely would only take a minute or two.)\n\nWell-meaning apps that hog resources\niOS Safari, for example, appears to try to keep as many tabs in memory / ‘running’ as it can get away with. In practice, this can often result in Safari (or another app) to be forced closed while in the background, interfering with multi-tasking (and causing even more cpu usage when those apps have to be cold-started… instead of just waking them from an idle/sleeping state).\n[To be fair, this probably made much more sense back in 2012 or so, when most web pages didn’t use much if any javascript after the initial rendering of the page, and when browser security restrictions didn’t prevent sharing cached content between similar tabs. The web landscape in 2022 is very different indeed.]\n\nAnalytics reporting files\nFinally, while not very user-friendly to read, the analytics reports available under the ‘Privacy->Analytics & Improvements->Analytics Data’ section of the iOS ‘Settings’ app can sometimes provide insight. Specifically, those of types:\n\n*\n\n*spindump - an app’s UI has frozen for more than a certain number of seconds and was automatically ‘killed’/quit by iOS itself\n\n*cpu_resource for specific apps, e.g. analytics.cpu_resource, MobileSafari.cpu_resource, or photoanalysisd.cpu_resource - a specific app has exceeded preset CPU usages (i.e. more than 50% cpu over 180 seconds)\n\n*JetsamEvent reports occur when an app has been closed by iOS to free up RAM… if that app is set to run in the background, it starting up again could cause an increase in CPU usage\n\n*runningboardd - unknown, but looks like it may have data that could be useful with further analysis\n\n*AppName.wakeups_resource - appears to be logged when an app exceeds ‘a limit of 150 wakeups per seconds over 300 seconds’\n\n*xp_amp_app_usage_dnu appears to contain data about which apps you haven’t recently used, which could be helpful to focus your search on the correct apps for your specific device\n\nAny of these individual files can be copied off the device using the ‘Share’ icon, or downloaded en masse via certain Apple tools (such as ‘Apple Configurator 2’, as I recall).\n\nPerhaps by the time iOS/iPadOS 19 arrives, Apple will finally provide a proper native macOS-style ‘Activity Monitor’ app!\n", "Q: Is cellular phone functionality in an iPad theoretically possible? Is it theoretically possible that with the existing hardware in a cellular iPad model that software for the device could enable it to become a large iPhone (make phone calls + send receive texts through cellular system)?  or is there a hardware limitation that would prevent this.  For this question, assume a GSM carrier (i.e. T-mobile) and an iPad Air with cellular\n\nA: Yes, it is theoretically possible. For example, the first iPad Air in the cellular version has the same baseband modem IC chip that the iPhone 5 has.\nHowever please note that it is not possible for a third party app to in any way \"activate\" or \"reconfigure\" the voice capabilities through that chip. Only Apple could, theoretically, add cellular voice capability to the iPad. In my opinion, that is not likely to happen at all.\nYou can add voice capability to the iPad using methods other than a cellular carrier - for example via traditional VoIP or cloud services such as Skype and similar.\n\nA: One aspect missing from your question: there is no iPhone?\nIf the plan is completely replace an iPhone with an iPad, jksoegaard is spot on.\nIf the idea is to supplement an iPhone with the iPad, then, with the same Apple ID in the iCloud & FaceTime settings you can have the iPad act as a secondary device. This option does not require cellular on the iPad, but does require an internet connection of some kind including cellular data. (Initial set up of the option does require a local wifi network.)\nMake and receive calls on your Mac, iPad, or iPod touch\nYou likely thought of this, but just wanted to make sure we didn't miss something that might help.\n", "Q: Stuck in recovery mode and unable to install OS X El Capitan Hi to anyone able to help with this / having the same problem...\nI use a 2009 iMac A1224 20\" with a SSD, running macOS El Capitan (the shop which installed the SSD also installed El Capitan back in 2018.)\nI recently been having some problems - spinning beach-ball, white screen / load bar freezing at 50% during start up. \nI cleared out disk space, installed updates, reset PRAM and verified the drive - none of this seemed to help.\nLuckily it does actually start up every 1/20 times, so I've backed everything up externally. \nInitially I tried to re-install macOS, entering recovery mode using Command + R or Command + Option + R but only got in with Command + Option + Shift + R - I don't know if that's because it is an old model?\nWhen trying to re-install El Capitan I keep getting \"This item is Temporarily unavailable\" with my Apple ID. I've tried two old Apple IDs and had not luck either. I've logging in to my new/current iCloud and Apple ID (made after these problems started happening) and seen my iMac is listed under my devices. \nI recently tried erasing the SSD / Macintosh HD but it's not made any difference. Now when I start up I loads straight into Recovery Mode automatically.\nAlso since erasing my SSD, the newly named partitions do not appear in the Recovery Mode Startup Manager - the section 'Choose Startup Disk: Select The system you want to use' is now blank. \nI am stuck in recovery mode and unable to install macOS X El Capitan.\nAny suggestions?\nThank you\n\nA: Everything you said tells me \"hard drive failure.\" It is not uncommon for a system to have boot issues when the hard drive is failing. The fact that you can't see the other partition and \"this item is temporarily unavailable makes it sound like that's the issue. \nOften when you try to reinstall the OS with a failing hard drive, you will get errors. This is primarily due to the hard drive having to write a file (the new OS) to the entire hard drive, whereas if you're using it, you're only accessing specific parts of the hard drive. You may have been avoiding that one \"failing\" spot, but when reinstalling the OS, it hit it.\nI'd highly recommend taking it to an Apple Store or AASP (Apple Authorized Service Provider) and have them run a diagnostics check on it to verify. Or if you have an external bootable usb drive, attempt to boot into that.\n", "Q: Control volume with right mouse button + mouse wheel Are there any programs that let me assign custom action such as changing the volume on mouse gestures (right click+scroll wheel), similar to Volumouse on Windows?\n\nA: Using SteerMouse (thanks @CrashBurner), click \"Chords\", then the \"+\" on the bottom left, add shortcut and assign action (under the Music Control category).\nNote in the image below: Roll Down = Volume Up is because the \"natural scrolling\" nonsense (for standard mouse wheels) was fixed using \"Standard wheel direction\" in SmoothScroll.\n\n\nA: I haven't heard of a new tool for some time, but SteerMouse might be worth a look, but it depends on your current OS version. I'd verify it would work with you machine before you download/purchase.\n", "Q: Restart on password unlock? I have my an old iphone 5 running iOS 10 that I decided to get repaired. I never knew until now of this lock out forever thing that happens if you get the password wrong 10 times in a row until I read about it yesterday. \nSo a couple days ago I try to figure out my old password and get to the 60 minute deactivation. This boggled my mind since I never seen it go this long. But I think I know what my password is now (strongly) but am not 100% sure. If I turn off my phone for a few days, would it somehow restart the password count and I could try a few more times?\n\nA: \nIf I turn off my phone for a few days, would it somehow restart the\n  password count and I could try a few more times?.\n\nIn a word, no. You can try restoring your phone to factory settings using these steps at Apple Support.\nIf you backed up your device, you can restore your data and settings after restoring your device. If you never backed up your device before you forgot your passcode, you won't be able to save the data on your device. \nQuoth Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have iTunes, download and install iTunes on your Mac or PC. If you don't have a computer, borrow one from a friend, or go to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider.\n\n*Make sure that your device isn't connected to your computer, then choose your device below and follow the steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6s or earlier, iPod touch (6th generation or earlier), or iPad with Home button: Press and hold the Side (or Top) button until the power off slider appears.\n\n*Drag the slider to turn off your device.

And this thing wasn't happening before. Let me show it with a screenshot:\nSay, if I close one app and want to go to the Mail icon. I will try to touch \"Mail\" (blue one, second from the left) at the bottom row. But right when I'm doing this, that new icon appears on the right (marked with a red arrow) and the whole strip shifts to the left making me click the App store icon instead of Mail.\n\nThis is VERY annoying!\nHow do I stop that icon from appearing on the right?\n\nA: That's the \"handoff\" feature. You can turn it off at: Settings > General > Handoff.\nWhen you turn it off, that device can't send or receive handoffs. A little bit more info. \n\nYou could also use a different iCloud account on your phone/iPad if you wanted handoff to work between a Mac and one device but not both iOS devices, but more than one iCloud is a hassle, so disabling handoff entirely is much cleaner.\n\nA: I think you will find that going to ‘General’, Home screen and dock’ then ’show suggested and recent apps in dock’ may help you.\n", "Q: Continuity limitations As I understand it, continuity enables a wifi only device to work in conjunction with an iPhone to make / receive calls.  If an inbound phone call is picked up on the iPad and the iPhone's battery fails in the middle of the call, will the call drop?  I am trying to understand exactly how the call is routed and if the call is a VOIP call through the internet or router through the iPhone's GSM radio. \n\nA: Calls are received as a normal call on your phone and then it uses wifi to tell other devices on the same network that a phone call is incoming. If accepted on other devices, the phone is used as a proxy. Voice data is transferred from the device to the iPhone over wifi and then to the cellular network and vice versa. If your phone dies the call will drop. If your phone goes out of wifi, I think the call will be transferred to your iPhone.\nThis is different from Wi-Fi calling which doesn't require your iPhone on the same network.\n", "Q: iPhone 5c can't install Netflix because iOS 11 is required I have an iPhone 5c and want to download Netflix. Every time I try though, it tells me that I need iOS 11 which my phone can't do. It doesnt give me an option to download the last compatible version. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Unless you've bought/downloaded Netflix before (at a time there still was a Netflix app compatible with your current iOS version) you can't access old versions in the store. \n\n*Netflix might have pulled old versions from the store because theAPI between the app and the netflix servers changed and old versions can't talk to the backend any longer\n\n", "Q: Could I take a Core i7 form a 2012 MBP and put it into a 2018 MBP? I know very little about computer hardware so I thought I might as well ask.\nI have an Intel Core i7 in my MacBook Pro Late 2012. I am considering getting a 2018 MacBook Pro. I was wondering if it is possible to purchase an Intel Core i5 2018 model and then just take the 2012 Core i7 and put it in the 2018.\nI am wondering if this is realistically possible and also if its technically possible (like could the 2018 hardware accept a 2012 core i7 or would there be other hardware compatibility issues).\nI am also wondering how a 2012 Core i7 processor compares to a 2018 Core i5 (would it be worth it).\n\nA: I don't know what exact CPU model numbers are involved here, but a simple check of the sockets for the ranges shows that the 2011 or 2012 i7 will not fit on a motherboard designed for a 2017 or 2018 i5 (of course Apple may have used a 2010 i7 or a 2016 i5 in their computers, but the same thing would apply).\nThe later i5 also uses a different I/O bus, but that might be backwards compatible (haven't checked as it's irrelevant since you won't be able to fit the CPU in the first place).\nDepending on the exact models involved, the old i7 also would require quite a lot more power than the new i5, meaning higher power draw and heat generation, both problems the new computer case and power supply might not be able to handle.\n\nA: Realistically possible? No.\nTechnically possible? I'm not going to say it'd be absolutely 100% impossible, but unless you had the time, skills, equipment (and money) to burn on a side project, it really wouldn't be a practical exercise. By this I mean I can't see a way for you to then be able to use it in the usual manner one uses a laptop (too much by way of modifications required to get it to work in a typical everyday manner).\nAnd most importantly - to address the 2nd question you snuck in there :) - It wouldn't be worth it. I'm assuming you're talking about the 13\" models as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The top 13\" 2012 MacBook Pro has a 2.9GHz (Core i7) processor with two cores. \n\n*The bottom 13\" 2018 MacBook Pro has a 2.3GHz (Core i5) processor with four cores. \n\n\nAt the risk of oversimplifying things with this analogy, having four cores compared to two cores is like having four people v two people trying to do some heavy lifting. In most cases, four people each capable of lifting 50kg is better than having two people each capable of lifting 60kg. \nTo put this into perspective, testing both these MacBook Pros using the same benchmarking tests, we get the following results:\n\n\n*\n\n*13\" 2012 MacBook Pro (2.9GHz Core i7) achieves a single core score of 3,192 and a multi-core score of 6,194\n\n*13\" 2018 MacBook Pro (2.3GHz Core i5) achieves a single core score of 4,496 and a multi-core score of 16,445\nInformation on how to interpret these results is available here\nSo, as you can see, the newer MacBook Pro specs are significantly better than the older model, despite it having the i5 processor at a lower clock speed than the i7 processor.\n", "Q: Can't connect to FTP with Catalina Beta Since upgrading to Catalina Beta, FileZilla, Transmit & Finder software fails to connect to the remote host.\nFileZilla gives error:\nStatus:         Connection attempt failed with \"EHOSTUNREACH - No route to host\", trying next address.\nStatus:         Connecting to xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:21...\nStatus:         Connection attempt failed with \"EHOSTUNREACH - No route to host\".\n\nThe same credentials work on Macs with Mojave 10.14.4.\nThe Firewall on the Catalina Beta is not on.\nHow do I get FTP working on Catalina Beta?\n\nA: Safari was slow also.\nChecking network settings, I see a hide.me VPN active.\nDisabling this resolved the issue.\nNo idea how the VPN got installed.\n", "Q: Smart App Banner install attribution in App Store Connect App Analytics Reference: Smart App Banners\nAre Smart Banner installs included in \"Web Referrers\" when looking at App Analytics > Sources > Web Referrers?\nDefinition of Web Referrers:\n\nCustomers tapped a link form a website that brought them to your App Store product page\n\nTo me that doesn't sound like it includes Smart Banner installs.\n\nIf you promote your app with Smart App Banners in Safari, you can add your campaign token and provider token when implementing a Smart App Banner on your website.\n  source\n\nThis section on Smart Banners is a separate section from app analytics / referrers.

So far I'm in love with this machine, clean thin design and very performant (the addition of a 6 core CPU and DDR4 RAMS is much welcome).\nHowever, there's one issue that I can't figure out if it's just me or it's something to do with the machine. Whenever I look at my keyboard, It feels like it's raised a little bit in the top middle kinda like there's a small bump. I showed it to my friends, some seem to notice it and some don't. Some are saying that it's just an optical illusion.\nHas anyone come across any information to suggest this is a known issue? If so, what?\n\nA: Here’s how I would try to figure this out.\nif you have a straight edge, perhaps a 12\" metal ruler, try laying that ON EDGE across the keyboard at the bottom, top, and middle, and perhaps even a couple diagonal angles. I'm not sure if the newer models are like mine at home, but the keys rest just ever-so-slightly below the case, so you should be able to see if anything is approaching the ruler's edge across the span.\nif you're unable to tell, something like this could probably warrant a pic or two added here, or even if just taken from your phone, which could then be examined by eye and perhaps by selection in a photo editing app. it wouldn't be 100% accurate, but if there was an upward shift of pixels in the middle versus the two ends, you might have something. \neither way, better to be sure now while under warranty, so you can at least get it on notice in case it gets worse. if it's related to heat, or perhaps some sort of battery swelling, it might be more noticeable at certain times. I've had several batteries expand over the years, and I believe they all stayed the bloated width, but before they became damaging or even just noticeable, they might have swelled and reverted, I can't say.\n", "Q: Is there a way to tell a Macbook to bump up the clock speed of the processor? I have a Macbook 12 inch that has a processor (CPU) running at 1.2GHz but with Turbo Boost up to 2.6GHz.\nIt is feeling a little slow sometimes, probably because it is running at 1.2GHz and not doing any Turbo Boost.\nIs there a way to tell the processor to run at 1.8 or 2.0GHz regularly?\n\nA: The Intel Turbo Boost feature will decide by itself when to switch to a higher CPU clock. There is no way to manually activate overclocking. See also Intel's FAQ on the matter:\n\nHow is Intel® Turbo Boost Technology enabled or disabled?\nIntel Turbo Boost Technology is enabled by default. You can disable or enable the technology with a switch in the BIOS. No other user controllable settings to change Intel Turbo Boost Technology operation are available. Once enabled, Intel Turbo Boost Technology works automatically under operating system control.\n\nYou can use e.g. Turbo Boost Switcher to turn Turbo Boost off, but as stated above, it is enabled by default.\nThat being said, you can create optimal conditions for you CPU to decide to overclock. According to the Intel's support document, the following factors influence clock speed / activation of Turbo Boost:\n\nAvailability and frequency upside of Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 state depends upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n*\n\n*Type of workload\n\n*Number of active cores\n\n*Estimated current consumption\n\n*Estimated power consumption\n\n*Processor temperature\n\nWhen the processor is operating below these limits and the user's workload demands additional performance, the processor frequency will dynamically increase until the upper limit of frequency is reached. Intel® Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 has multiple algorithms operating in parallel to manage current, power, and temperature to maximize frequency and energy efficiency.\n\nTherefore you can try the following:\n\n*\n\n*Turbo Boost will only activate if thermals allow it. So making sure your MacBook is sufficiently cool can lead to higher clock speeds. You could even use an app to manually increase the fan speed, such as Macs Fan Control or iStat Menus, to decrease CPU temperature further.\n\n*Especially for single-threaded applications you can make sure you have no other (background) tasks running. This will, again, improve thermals, reduce power consumption, and also allow the CPU to overclock.\n\nTo learn more about your MacBook's behaviour and clock speed you can use utilities to monitor clock speed, power consumption, and temperature, such as iStat Menus or Intel Power Gadget.\n\n", "Q: Dual identical monitors swap settings after displays turn off I have dual LG 4k monitors on a 2015 macbook pro on High Sierra.

This occurs at the creation of the alias, not when you want to use the alias. As shown after your first run of alias myls, the alias contains the exact path, not a call to pwd, so this will always use the original path set when you created the alias.\nTo use the current directory, don't run pwd, just use a relative path, which will always refer to the current directory when run.\nalias myls=\"ls -lrth .\"\n\n\nA: You just have to use single quotes.

I use Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) to connect to and control my friend's Mac computer, which is USB connected to the iOS device so I can see the screen through QuickTime. From here I talk to my friend on the phone or chat to tell them what they should do as I see exactly what's going on on the screen. \nThe next level is when I activate this Accessibility feature called Switch Control on the remote Mac, which essentially lets you do actions on a LAN connected iOS device. And just when I thought I worked out my magic, it appears Switch Control won't recognise any keystroke or mouse clic that are not physically performed on the remote computer. Even the onscreen keyboard doesn't work ...damn!\nIf I create a switch button (trigger) remotely, the remote Mac will register it, but neither me or my friend can use the trigger for Switch Control. If the trigger is registered based on a physical input, my friend can use it, but I can't, even through the onscreen keyboard.\nSo it appears no matter what trigger you register, Switch Control will never recognise remote/virtual input for actual use of the triggers. However, I cannot believe there is no way to simulate that physical input so that Switch Control does listen to my input sent remotely through ARD.\nThis is the only one single way to remotely control an iOS device in the context of Apple actively not supporting it, and yet just that small little detail prevents it from functioning. I'm basically looking for a way to simulate physical input in a manner that would be recognised by Switch Control.\nNote: jailbreak is not an option, and anyway Veency is no longer working as of iOS 12.\n\nA: I found out myself and I hope it'll be useful to other people. I don't think this has been done before.\nYou need to use BetterTouchTool to assign your remote input to the local trigger you want to use on the target machine, then go into BTT's preferences and tick the box \"Always use the old keyboard implementation\" in advanced keyboard settings. Now you have it, Switch Control will finally recognise your remote input and transmit it to your iOS device.\nCouple that with QuickTime's ability to display a USB wired device on the target machine, and you can now 'remotely control' that device using ARD or any other Mac-to-Mac remote control app such as iTeleport or AnyDesk. Of course Switch Control is very clanky way to control an iOS device, but at last it's now finally possible!\nThank you Apple for making my life a clanky hack joy. Next time please make an ARD that directly tunnels to iOS.\n", "Q: After installing software, I need to allow it to load in Security & Privacy. How do I do it with a script? So I'm working on deploying a piece of software for our organization. I deployed it with JAMF and it seems to work just like expected (exactly like if I installed it manually). \nThe thing is, that after installation finishes, I have to got to Settings -> Security & Privacy and in General tab I can see the message:\n\nSystem software from developer \"XXX\" was blocked from loading.\n\nIf I click the Allow button to the right, it is finished - program runs as expected.\nThe question is - how do I do it automatically, ex. with a script? Including the pop-up message just after installation that informs user, that it has to be allowed from settings?\n\nA: That's the whole point of Gatekeeper.  The user needs to manually allow for an application to run or have access to control your computer.  Otherwise any malicious application could just grant itself access and permissions to run and control your computer. \nYour best option would be creating a Readme.txt file with explicit step-by-step instructions on how to grant access and permissions for that application, to control your computer, in System Preferences.app\nThis following AppleScript code, In MacOS Mojave, will bring you to the System Preferences window where you can address the \"If I click the Allow button to the right\" issue that you have mentioned.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    tell its pane id \"com.apple.preference.security\"\n        reveal anchor \"General\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nAnd this AppleScript code will bring you to where you need to set Accessibility, Full Disk Access, and Automation privileges for the application.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    tell its pane id \"com.apple.preference.security\"\n        reveal anchor \"Privacy_Accessibility\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: Ok, So I have an answert for this, after further investigation.\nYou can add a vendor to trusted on the very low level of system config.\nThis is done by command:\nspctl kext-consent add VENDORID\n\nThere are some issues with it, though, as it isn't very straight forward. \nFirst, you need to get the VENDORID. The easiest way to do it is to get a clean MacOS installation. Any will work, but if you have some stuff installed, it may be a little more difficult to find vendor id on the list.\nInstall the program, that you need to allow manually. Go to terminal, run this command:\nsqlite3 /var/db/SystemPolicyConfiguration/KextPolicy\n\nIt will open a KextPolicy file in sqlite3. You need to run a search (select) query on this:\nSELECT * FROM kext_policy;\n\nIt should provide with a list of vendors of 3rd party software, that you might need to add consent for. It will start with a string of capital letters and numbers. I think, the length is fixed to 10 characters, but not sure about it. It may look like PXPZ95SK77.\nNow, you can add this with the command I mentioned before, so it would be like this:\nspctl kext-consent add PXPZ95SK77\n\nThe trick is - you can't do it from the level of running OS! You can either do it manually: reboot your computer into recovery mode (hold command+R on keyboard when booting a computer - right after apple logo shows up) and access terminal there. This is the manual way.\nGood thing, that JAMF let's you create a script that runs on startup (so you get automatization!)\nGo to your JAMF dashboard. Management Settings -> Computer Management -> Scripts. Create a New one. In Options choose priorty to At Reboot. My script is as follows:\n#!/usr/bin/env/bash \n\nspctl kext-consent add VENDORID\n\nNot sure, but I think that this script doesn't have to be assigned to any computer etc. - it seems to be running on them automatically. But since this is an antivirus, that we recon is standard for all computers in our organization, that is ok with us.\nA great source of knowledge was this link, which massively helped me figuring this thing out!\n", "Q: Apps that are Chromium or Electron base crashes on Catalina beta 6 (19A536g) So I recently updated from beta 5 of Catalina to beta 6 and noticed more than half of my apps will crash after the initial launch, these apps include things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Brave browser (beta, nightly)\n\n*Chrome (tried beta as well)\n\n*Chrome Canary (the same)\n\n\nAny apps that are electronJS based such as: Spotify, Slack, Atom, VSCode & etc...\nI have a hunch that it has something to do with a browser wrapper that can't be set\nAlready tried and failed:\nsudo spctl --master-disable\nAlso re-installed apps, tried a whole different version and to no avail\nis there anything I can do to fix this locally?\n\nA: Unfortunately, the best you can do is revert to Mojave. This is a bug in AppKit that Apple caused (and must soon fix). It persists in beta 7.\nI can feel your pain. I need my Electron apps like VS Code and Insomnia. The bug also affects JetBrains apps like PyCharm and Android Studio (based off IntelliJ).\n", "Q: Replacing AZERTY keyboard by a QWERTY keyboard Is it possible to replace the top case with the  AZERTY keyboard of a 15\" MB Pro late 2012 (usb 3.0) by the top case with QWERTY keyboard of a 15\" MB Pro Mid-2010. Do they have exactly the same dimensions?\n\nA: At one time it was possible to make the change and in the end it became impossible in the official Apple network.\nThe only solution I could offer you is to buy and replace the keys. I had done it one 2011. ok it's long but I changed the keyboard for 5€... then just change the layout of the language in the keyboard preferences.\n\nA: Whilst the topcase-and-keyboard is interchangable, changing the keyboard's nationality layout does not change what the machine knows as its native tongue. Yes, it is possible to change the keyboard layout in the OS to match the new languagr-layout, but that only takes effect once you have logged in - at the login screen, the keyboard will still be using the original language layout.\n", "Q: Is it safe to exclude Outlook 16.x data from Time Machine backups? Every hourly Time Machine backup is quite large for me, but I don't change that many files so rapidly. I've determined that the main culprits are under ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile. I'm hoping I can exclude something under here from Time Machine backups that will safely reduce the size of every hourly backup.\nI believe MS Outlook 16.x downloads email messages and attachments\nfrom the Outlook server under here, just for indexing and speed reasons. If I ever had data loss, those email messages and attachments would be downloadable again from the Outlook server. Therefore, excluding these from hourly backups seems reasonable to me.\nHowever, searching the internet for files to exclude from Time Machine backups never mentions this path. I can't tell whether that is because excluding these files is unsafe, or because MS Outlook 16.x is too new for people to have discovered these files. I find the latter hard to believe, especially since the path contains \"Outlook 15\".\nIs there something under this path that I can safely exclude from my Time Machine backups?\n\nA: Don't have a real answer, just data to share.  After losing a decade's worth of archived Outlook emails, to a drive failure, I tried restoring from TM.  These were emails from previous jobs, to which I no longer had access, so my local cache was my record.\nI had only mixed success - my user environment must have been corrupted by the drive failure, and even 1 year old backups would not get me my state back.  Outlook kept wanting to \"rebuild\" my mailboxes, which required two or three times the original mbox size (~500G at the time of loss).\nI didn't have terabytes worth of space for this, so I started picking and choosing what to restore.  That's when I found that, indeed, the bulk of archived/cached local mail, lives in the ~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9* path.\nBut Outlook also has SQLite data files elsewhere, and perhaps other metadata too, and no combination of restores would yield a working Outlook state - i.e. no rebuilds, just my mailboxes/folders as they were.\nSo my conclusion is that although it's probably safe to exclude this path from TM backups, if things ever do go south, and you also lose access to the mail server, then you risk losing everything, with no way to restore.\nSounds like in your use case, that's probably not a concern.\nAnyways, just one guy's Outlook & Time Machine story.\n", "Q: What version of OpenSSH is included with macOS Catalina (10.15) beta? I'm interested to know which version of OpenSSH ships today on Catalina beta\nCan someone running the beta version of Catalina run the following command in Terminal for me and provide the output?\n/usr/bin/ssh -V\n\nFor macOS 10.14 the output is OpenSSH_7.9p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3\nSo I'm after the output in macOS Catalina beta.\n\nA: Lastest macOS Catalina Beta shows the identical version to the current Mojave ssh\n$ sw_vers\nProductName:    Mac OS X\nProductVersion: 10.15\nBuildVersion:   19A536g\n$ /usr/bin/ssh -V\nOpenSSH_7.9p1, LibreSSL 2.7.3\n\n", "Q: Determine which app is opening too many files Sometimes my Mac starts behaving weirdly, a typical symptom being that I can't open certain apps that were working just fine recently.

For all I know, the few apps that I restarted were just barely enough to go under the limit, and I'll soon face the same issue. Rather than closing random apps which may or may not be contributing to this issue, I'd like to locate the specific app that is hoarding file handles and close it.\nI thought lsof would help me pinpoint the problematic app, but manually parsing its default output is unfeasible. I could write a shell script or Python program to group file handles by app, but I'm thinking there may be a switch to lsof that does this grouping automatically, or maybe an app similar to Activity Monitor but which display the number of open file handles per process.\nMy question then is: how can I display the number of open file handles grouped per process?\nI'm running macOS 10.14.5, if it makes a difference. Also, while I'm aware that I can increase the open file limit, I feel the real issue is that one of my apps is essentially leaking resources, not unlike a memory leak, and it's best for the performance of the system to just restart the affected app than blindly increase limits and allow the app to continue hoarding resources.\n\nA: Time to bring the power of Unix pipes, sort, and awk to the rescue.  But since lsof takes a long time to run I'll save the output and analyze that, rather than piping lsof directly into the pipe.\nFor reference here's the lsof output format:\n[iMac:~] droot% head /tmp/a\nCOMMAND    PID  USER   FD      TYPE             DEVICE   SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME\nloginwind   94 droot  cwd       DIR                1,7        896        2 /\nloginwind   94 droot  txt       REG                1,7    1237152 18011104 /System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app/Contents/MacOS/loginwindow\nloginwind   94 droot  txt       REG                1,7      21024 18566026 /Library/Preferences/Logging/.plist-cache.HrVraTtH\nloginwind   94 droot  txt       REG                1,7   27154336 18044520 /usr/share/icu/icudt62l.dat\n\nAnd my analysis:\nlsof > /tmp/a\ncat /tmp/a | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n | head\n\n 511 724\n 469 2790\n 384 2791\n 360 2793\n 350 2798\n 227 286\n 224 658\n 210 3833\n 197 655\n 190 698\n\nExplaining the non-obvious lines:\n\n\n*\n\n*awk '{print $2}'  prints the 2nd field in each line (the PID in this case).  This is about all the awk I remember.  Really useful!\n\n*uniq -c    Takes a sorted list of PIDs and eliminates duplicate adjacent lines, with the -c modifier it adds a count of the number of lines found (in our case that's one line per open file from that process).\n\n*\"sort -r -n\" sorts numerically in reverse order (largest number at top)\n\n*\"head\" prints out the first 10 lines (10 processes with largest number of open files).\n\n\nThat shows that PID 724 has 511 open files on my system.  To look in more detail:\ncat /tmp/a | grep \" 724 \"\n\nIn my case that process was Dropbox, which is \"interesting\" but I can see that that process might need many open files.  So going to the next one:\ncat /tmp/a | grep \" 2790 \"\n\nAnd so on down the list.  Hopefully your \"offender\" is obvious from the lsof output sorted by number of open files per PID.\nFor total number of open files use \"wc\" (wordcount):\n[iMac:~] droot% cat /tmp/a | wc\n9777   90500 1445558\n\nWhich means 9776 open files in my case (have to subtract the header line).\n\nA: Did you tried:\nlsof -n | awk '{print $1}' | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n $LINES\n\nIt should print a list of processes sorted by the number of open files \n\nA: I just found the Sloth app. It is basically a GUI for lsof, and is able to group and sort processes by file count, which is exactly what I need. About the only thing I could ask for that is missing was a tally of the total number of open files in the system.\n\nA: I am just utility level familiar with lsof, but can Activity Monitor be used in some way? It might result in CPU usage spike for a little time, but it shows ports, threads and open files per process after double clicking on the process. And since you see, a lot of files are open, I suspect memory usage will be high too, so apps can be sorted and checked in a fashion shown below. It is a generic version of what I think sloth app you mentioned does.\n\n", "Q: how do I save the extra files that come in a dmg? After I download a DMG to my Mac and install the apps that come in it, where should I keep the miscellaneous other files (like Readme and license terms) that come in the DMG? I want to keep them, but where, and how do I keep them associated with their app? Keeping the entire DMG just for its little misc files seems wasteful of storage. What is the normal practice?\n\nA: Personally, I create a folder within the Applications folder with the same name as the app installed from the DMG and put the extra files in that folder. That way, they're always side by side and I can easily find them.\nThat, of course, is just personal preference. There is no strictly correct way of doing that.\n", "Q: VMware Fusion - Professional Version 8.5.10 I have a user that has High Sierra (don't ask why) just that he has it, and he is getting an error stating that parts of his VMWare are not 64-bit compatible. \nI expect he will need to upgrade to 11, which is almost a given, but here is my question.  If there are instances inside his VM that are 32-Bit compliant only, are they talking about the apps inside his VM? Or are they talking about the VM itself? \nI ask this because I went onto the website to look up the information and it's rather sparse. I was hoping the big brains here would be able to help me clear this up a little. \nIf the message is pertaining to the software inside the VM, I can get one of the techs here to pistolwhip him into submission by actually following protocol.  \nOtherwise, I'll just tell him to use a VDI as he should be anyway. \n\nA: VMware Fusion 8.x is not supported on macOS 10.13.x High Sierra, he needs version 10.x or newer (no v9.x exists, because this release was called 8.5.x - and was a free upgrade).\nYou can have a look here: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2088571 \nIt could very well be that High Sierra became more strict about how an app should be built (no mix between 32-bit and 64-bit ??) - but still pure 32-bit would be okay, and of course pure 64-bit would also work.

Will the Macbook be charged while connected to the Monitor?\nI found this post:\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2016/12/21/lg-ultrafine-5k-mac-compatibility/\nhowever, it does not specify if the MacBook12 is compatible.\n(Usually an iMac 2019 is connected to this monitor, which works great, the Macbook12 will be used with this monitor just from time to time...)\n\nA: For starters, no, the LG UltraFine 5k 27\" display will not power the 12\" MacBook (Early 2016) models.\nAs for being able to out put video to the LG UltraFine 5k 27\" display, this is not officially supported by Apple. See Use the first gen LG UltraFine 5K Display with your Mac and Use the second gen LG UltraFine 5K Display with your Mac\nHowever, it may be possible by getting a USB 3.1 Gen 1 digital video output to Thunderbolt 3 adapter (or a combination of adapters to achieve that outcome) and then running the LG UltraFine 5K 27\" display at lower resolutions.\nThe problem you're going to face (besides the cabling involved) is that your MacBook is capable of external resolutions of:\n\n\n*\n\n*up to 3840 by 2160 pixels at 30Hz\n\n*up to 4096 by 2160 pixels at 24Hz\n\n\nThe LG UltraFine 5k 27\" display, on the other hand, is designed to work in the 48Hz to 60Hz range (although all its recommended resolutions are specified at 60Hz). See below table for  Signal Timing specs:\n\nAs you can see, trying to find a sweet spot to run the LG UltraFine 5k 27\" display from your MacBook looks challenging and probably not worth the time, effort and money to try as it'll most likely result in failure anyway. \nHowever, over the years I have seen people far exceed what is officially supported by Apple in terms of various MacBook models and the displays they're connected to, so if you're happy to invest the time etc, it may be a fun project.\n", "Q: How to completely reinstall Mac OS X? I have a MacBook which OS was upgraded from Snow Leopard 10.6.3 to 10.6.8 and then to El Capitan 10.11.\nI want to completely reinstall  El Capitan, to \"factory state\", in order to really \"clean\" the Mac. (However, I don't need to prevent data recovery.)\nI started the MacBook holding down the \"Alt\" key and selected the partition for reinstalling, logged to Apple and the download of El Capitan was progressing.\nThen, I moved away from the Mac for about two hours. \nWhen I came back, the user account is unchanged, with previously installed apps. Seems like the installer decided in my absence to keep the user files.\nCan I resintall El Capitan to \"factory state\" without wiping the whole drive?\nOr should I create a new user and then delete existing one?\n\nA: You almost got it right, but you didn’t wipe the disk first. You’ll want to wipe Macintosh HD in recovery mode first (choose Disk Utility) then repeat the steps you took to install El Capitan.\n\nA: No, you need to format the whole disk first!  \nFollow this guide to create a mac bootable usb key using createinstallmedia \nTo delete all the content of the hard disk \nmake a linux bootable usb key. You can choose the distro that you prefer, insert it in the mac and hold option during the boot process, then start the system, open gparted and format all the disk.   \nNow insert the mac bootable media and run the installer pressing option during the boot, just wait and all will be fine.\n", "Q: Including virtual environment in bash prompt I am using bash on MacBook Air running macOS Mojave   and wanted to change the color of terminal prompt. \nI was helped on this question on SO and this IBM blog after which I used \nexport PS1=\"\\[\\e[30;47m\\]\\W\\[\\e[30;47m\\]$\\[\\e[0m\\]\"\n\nwhich has colour, wrapping, working directory and $.\nIt changed the colour but the prompt doesn't have (base) or (ml) in it. \nIt is the virtual environment I created using conda. conda deactivate  removes it.

I've worked out how to do one at a time (just the regular filter function), but I want to filter for both of these at once so that I have only people of X location and Y rating.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Unless I'm missing something from your question, you've actually already worked out how to do this.\nThat is, if you first filter by one column the way you want, and then filter by the second column the way you want, you've effectively filtered both columns.\nSo, using your example, say you filter the location column so that only people in location X are showing. Then if you proceed to filter that list so that only those with rating Y are still showing, then the end result is you only have people of X location and Y rating listed.\n", "Q: Safari favorites disappeared on my iMac I have an iMac running High Sierra and Safari version 12.1.2.

Where have all my favorites gone? \nI've quit safari and restarted. I've restarted my computer. Neither worked.\n\nA: I can't tell you where all your favourites have gone, but since you have a Time Machine backup from three weeks ago, your best bet is probably to recover them from there (as I'm guessing you haven't added a lot to your bookmarks in the past three weeks).\nThe file you're needing to replace is your Bookmarks.plist file.

I’m looking to understand how to test and evaluate chargers so this is a bit technical a problem. Since MagSafe is proprietary, I can’t consult a USB power distribution specification to know how things are designed to work.\nWhat is the voltage output of an Apple 85W MagSafe 2 model A1424 without a load?\n\nA: I believe these are smart chargers, and initially only supply about 3 volts in order to power a power management chip inside the device to be charged.  Once powered by the 3 volts, the power management chip inside the device then communicates with the charger verifying that the device is compatible to be charged, and if that fact is verified, only then will the charger output full charge voltage.\nAdditional info provided by @MarcWilson.\n\nA: Based on the answers to this question the supply doesn't communicate with a power management chip - it simply looks for a resistance of approximately 40 kΩ between its output and ground, and if this is detected then the full output voltage is enabled. \nAlso based on the above answers, if you often measure 0.2 V rather than 3 V then an intermittent fault in the cable seems most likely.\n", "Q: Can my admin manage my iPad without me knowing? \n*\n\n*Can my admin manage my iPad (download programs, change settings, etc.) without me knowing?

I have two MacOS installs as part of a dual-boot configuration on my MBP.  Both happen to be Mojave 10.14.  They are installed on two encrypted APFS volumes in the same APFS container. \nI want to be able to set the next boot volume without supplying a decrypt password or holding down the option key during reboot.  Related, I want the current 'other volume' to be the default volume.  The current default is the second MacOS install that I performed.\nThe troubles I see:\n1) Under System Preferences -> Startup Disk is that the decryption password is needed:  \"It must be unlocked to determine if it is a valid startup disk.\"\n   - this can't technically be true.  When I hold down the Option key during boot the decryption passwords aren't known at that time yet two volume options are presented.\n\n2) The examples of command-line bless command are based on a volume mounted under /Volumes which of course means the decryption password is made available.\n\nA: I was able to change the default boot volume which is just a partial resolution of my question.  This is done by using an alternate form of the bless command based on an un-mounted storage device.

It's not uncommon for batteries to exceed or fall short of this number; as every user is different in terms of what they use their computers for and how/when they're using AC power etc. So the 1,000 cycles is just an estimation of how long it can last. But, in your case, the battery has lasted 1,500 cycles and this is 50% more than its life expectancy. To be frank, I'm surprised the status is Replace Soon instead of Replace Now or Service Battery.\nHowever, since it is still showing Replace Soon, you could test for how your MBP behaves during Safe Mode. \nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window \n\n*Now log into your Mac and (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)\n\n*Now test to see if your MacBook wakes up normally after you've put it to sleep\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Once again, test to see if your Mac wakes up normally after you've put it to sleep\n\n\nIf you find that your MacBook still doesn't wake up while in Safe Mode or when logged in normally afterwards, then proceed to Running Apple Diagnostics below.\nIf on the other hand you find that your MacBook does wake up from sleep in Safe Mode, but still doesn't when you're logged in normally, then let me know and we'll troubleshoot further.\nRunning Apple Diagnostics\nYour model MBP uses Apple Diagnostics to test its hardware. You can do this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your MBP\n\n*Restart your MBP\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \n", "Q: How can I download the file on iCloud Drive manually?

At work I have a Dell OptiPlex 7050 and two Dell monitors (one is HDMI, the other is VGA/DVI). Unfortunately, the way the office is set up I don't have easy access to an actual plug into a wall....\nSo far I've tried plugging my USB-C cable from my MBP to the Dell desktop. With that, the computer recognizes it's plugged into a power source (gets the little charging icon and says \"Power source: Power adapter\") but also states that the \"Battery is not charging\" and the percentage continues to drop. So that didn't work.\nAre there any other suggestions?\nWould be helpful to get input on a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to get the USB-C from the Dell desktop to work?\n\n*Would USB-A from the Dell desktop with a USB-A to USB-C cable work any better? \n\n*Do all computer monitors allow pass through charging? What would be the best way to go about trying this (HDMI? VGA? DVI? Or USB-A?)\n\nA: The USB ports in the Desktop and monitors don't provide enough power to charge your MacBook. These ports tend to be build \"to spec\", meaning they output only about 500mA (USB 2.0) or 900mA (USB 3.0). Sometimes PCs have dedicated charging ports (maybe colored yellow) which provide more than 1A (they exceed the official USB specs), but that's still not nearly enough to charge a laptop. [1]\nSo you will need to get a charger (or a hub/dock[2]) that supports the \"power delivery\" (PD) protocol.\nYou can get them from anywhere between 18 and 100 Watts, and the power output makes a big difference in how fast your MacBook will charge. If you have patience, especially if you're not using the computer while it's charging, you can get away with a lower power (and smaller!) adapter (I use a 56W one, I would not recommend going lower than about 45W). Companies like Anker, Aukey, RavPower make some that are much cheaper and more compact than the original Apple charger.\n[1]: The power delivery protocol allows the power supply to step up the voltage in order to provide more power at a reasonable current. The Apple 61W charger goes up to about 3A at 21V (the equivalent of 12.2A at 5V, or 24 times as much current as a USB 2.0 port can provide).\n[2]: Note that some of the USB PD compatible hubs need a USB-C PD input in order to provide power on the output, so your best bet is to get a USB-C charger with Power Delivery and skip the hub. The ones that don't need a PD input tend to be (expensive) docks with lots of different ports.\nHere are Apple's recommendations for how much power your charger should have: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700\n\nA: Assuming that the monitors use an IEC plug on the backside, you can use an IEC cable splitter, like this\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Server-Splitter-Power-Extension-Cable/dp/B01G1JMFZQ/\nto grab the mains power from the monitor power cable and gain an extra power plug.\nThen use an adapter like this\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SF-Cable-Prong-Adapter-60320-C14/dp/B004OC579E/\nto convert the extra IEC plug to the power plug of your choice (this is a US NEMA plug, but these adapters are available for any power plug standard – UK, Euro, Schuko and whatnot).\nKeep in mind that in many countries you have to ask you employer first if you want to charge external devices at work, otherwise it w/c/ould technically be stealing.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to get the USB-C from the Dell desktop to work?\n\nThe short answer, no.  It would be rare for any desktop to provide more than 15 watts to it's USB-C ports.  Why this is comes with the long answer that follows.\nUSB-C ports are required by the USB standards body to supply 7.5 watts minimum.  Most computers supply more, either 12 or 15 watts, so don't expect more unless the computer lists USB-PD support from it's USB-C ports.\nSupplying more power from USB-C out of a desktop computer is likely quite trivial.  Inside most any desktop computer today is a power supply capable of providing many hundreds of watts but there's no real demand for more than a few watts of power from USB-C ports on a desktop.  Any large peripheral, such as a printer or display, will simply plug in to the wall for power.  Any small peripheral, such as a mouse or keyboard, will happily operate on a few watts of power.\nInside a common desktop computer will be a number of devices built to run on a standard 12 volts, such as cooling fans and hard drive motors.  It would be nearly trivial for a computer maker to run 12 volts to a USB-C port but, as it turns out, this would violate the USB-C spec.  USB-C allows for 4 voltages to be output to the USB-C port, 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V.  I don't know why the USB people disallowed 12 volts output to a USB-C port, I can only speculate.\nIf 12 volts were allowed on a USB-C port then there is a 3 amp limit, that's 36 watts.  USB-C only allows more than 3 amps when supplying 20 volts, again I can only speculate why but I consider this a relatively wise choice.  Even if 5 amps were allowed at 12 volts then that's 60 watts.  If you look at the power supplies for laptops of the last decade or three you will find that the power supplies are often rated for output of between 15 and 20 volts, and about 3 or 4 amps.  This is likely why the people that designed USB-C chose 15 and 20 volts as standards, and considered 3 amps minimum for a passive USB-C cable and 5 amps for active cables.  There's simply a ready market for this and all they needed to do was package this into their already popular data and power standard called USB.\nPutting more than 12 volts on a USB-C port means needing a power supply in the computer built to provide the 15 or 20 volts that USB-C allows, and currently there's little demand for this voltage but for providing more power to USB-C, and there's little demand for desktop computers to provide more than 12 watts from a USB-C port.\nJust to show how popular 20 volt power supplies are in computing look at any Lenovo laptop, desktop display, and many numbers of peripherals, that they produced in the last decade or three.  They've been using a standard 20 volt supply for many of their products, first with a yellow barrel connector, then with yellow \"SlimPort\" connector that shares a lot of features with USB-A and USB-C.  Other manufacturers did much the same though perhaps with not the vigor to consolidate their hardware to a single power supply standard that Lenovo or Apple had.  The Apple MagSafe connector was popular and provided 20 volts like their USB-C chargers today.  Apple abandoned MagSafe for USB-C fairly quickly, other computer makers will allow charging with their old power supplies in addition to the option of using USB-C.\n\nWould USB-A from the Dell desktop with a USB-A to USB-C cable work any\nbetter?\n\nNo.  This is likely going to get you the same 2.4 amps that USB-C provides.  Some USB-C ports will provide 3 amps, as will some USB-A ports.  To indicate the higher power they may have a yellow or red color to the plastic in the port.  When comparing 7.5 watts, to 12 watts, to 15 watts input to a laptop that wants to see 30, 45, or 60 watts, there's likely not much to lose or gain when picking a port.  They will all be slow charging.\n\nDo all computer monitors allow pass through charging?\n\nNo.  This is a rare feature, and often comes with a high price tag since such displays act as a laptop dock as much as a display.  Along with a display and power will come things like a web cam, speakers, Ethernet port, USB-A ports, and perhaps other useful items like a display output for dual display action, or a flash drive slot.\nPerhaps just as common as a display passing power to the computer is a computer passing power to the display.  I've seen Lenovo computers fit in a slot in the back of a display with the display taking power from the computer, and the computer taking power from a \"SlimPort\" 20 volt power supply.\n\nWhat would be the best way to go about trying this (HDMI? VGA? DVI? Or\nUSB-A?)\n\nThere is no good answer.  For most computers there's no output port that is going to supply more than 7.5 to 15 watts from a USB port.  Even so called \"Rapid Charging\" USB expansion PCIe cards I've seen supply only 15 watts to a USB port.\n", "Q: Some of my Google calendar contents just disappeared in Calendar.app macOS 10.14.6, Calendar.app 11.0 (2245.5.2)\nLess than an hour ago, I brought Calendar.app to the foreground (I usually keep it running, hidden in the background), and most (8 out of 12) of my Google calendar contents were completely gone.

Context: I installed an app called \"Scroll Reverser\" which will allow me to use the natural scrolling setting for my trackpad and the opposite scrolling setting for my mouse scroll wheel. The application requires the Privacy permission \"Input Monitoring\". The description of this is to \"Allow the apps to monitor input from your keyboard even while using other apps\".\nSo does Apple just consider mouse inputs, like scrolling, an \"input from your keyboard\"? \nThe app was recommended by another user on this site: How to separate \"mouse\" and \"trackpad\" settings?\n\nA: Scrolling can be a keyboard input. For example, using the arrow keys on a keyboard will often scroll the window.\nWhile I have no experience with the Scroll Reverser app, a quick check shows the source code is available. And, according to its Read Me file:\n\nScroll Reverser installs an event tap, which gives access to event stream, including scrolling events and gesture events. The main documentation is Quartz Event Services Reference.\nTo distinguish between trackpad and mouse, Scroll Reverser essentially\n  looks at the gesture events to determine whether there are 2 or more\n  fingers on the trackpad. If so, it assumes it is the trackpad.\n\nSince the app uses Quartz Event Services then it's basically monitoring low level inputs from users. More technical information is available on the Quartz Event Services page on Apple's Developer site.\nBut essentially, monitoring low level inputs also means monitoring keyboard inputs.\n", "Q: Triple boot on Macbook Air with external SSD I own a 2015 Macbook Air running Mojave. I plan to triple boot Mac, Windows 10, and Linux by installing them (Windows and Linux) on an external SSD and booting from there. Preferably, I don't want to use rEFind or similar, as I don't want to make any (major) changes to my Mac.\nIn my search for answers, this thread in particular caught my eye as a viable solution, however a full explanation on how to resolve the problem was not given.\nBasically, I would like to have a full list of steps (doesn't have to be too detailed) that would allow a new-ish user like me to complete a triple boot from start to finish, elaborating on this step:\n\nUse more than one EFI partition. A drive can have more than one EFI partition. Additional EFI partitions do not have to reside at the beginning of the drive.\n\nThanks in advance!\nEDIT: I have found a good resource over here which covers how to setup up all the boot files, and installs rEFInd on the external drive rather than the internal one. I will edit again to confirm if it works :) In the meantime, I am satisfied with existing person's documentation of the beginning steps.\nEDIT 2: I have successfully triple booted from an external SSD, so thanks to everyone who helped me plus the random writer on Medium. It seems like Linux distros are getting better every day, because apparently by mounting the drive's EFI partition to /boot/efi during installation, Manjaro's boot manager handles both the Linux and Windows operating systems. To be honest the hardest part was writing Windows to the USB. I still have a few problems with Linux to sort out (no wifi drivers, Nvidia graphics card causing GRUB to not boot) but everything's well documented.\n\nA: I think I may be able to help you triple boot, although I haven't tried triple booting yet. I do know how to install Windows on a separate SSD, and I'm pretty sure you can just install Linux by partitioning the SSD. Here are the steps:\nStep 1: First, you have to install both Windows 10 and Ubuntu ISO files. Ubuntu from here: Ubuntu ISO File, and Windows 10 from here: Windows 10 ISO File\nStep 2: Connect your SSD and partition it in Disk Utility, however you want it. You should probably name one of them \"Windows\" and the other \"Linux\", so it's easier to identify.\n\nStep 3: Now, you will need another USB for this, 8 GB or more, so you can store the installation files. Then use Bootcamp Assistant, click continue, and click Create a Windows 10 or later install disk, and make sure Download the latest Windows support software is also checked.\n\nStep 4: Click continue, and I think you can choose the Windows 10 ISO image and install the Windows installer on the USB. It should take around 15 minutes for it to finish. Then restart your Mac while holding Option.\nStep 5: Keep holding Option until a screen that shows \"Mac\" and \"WININSTALL\" shows up. There may be other drives, but you can ignore them. Use your arrow keys to select \"WININSTALL\" and press Enter.\n\n(The image is an example, yours shouldn't show Windows)\nStep 6: Follow the steps through the installer, and when you get to the \"Choose drive\" page, and make sure to select the correct drive. If you choose the wrong one, it may erase everything. If you named the partition on your SSD, choose the named one (maybe \"windows\") and click next. If next is greyed out, click format and try again. If it is still greyed out, then you will have to reply with the error it shows on the bottom left.\n\nStep 7: If the previous step goes smoothly, then it should install Windows 10 on that partition of your SSD. If it successfully installs, it should automatically restart to the Windows 10 Setup for new computers. Follow the steps on the screen and it should finish successfully as well. Now, I think that there will be a \"Bootcamp Drivers install\" or something pop up. Install that as well so you can use Windows 10 properly with Mac.\nStep 8: Alright, you are halfway done now! (The next part about installing Linux is assumed, and reply if you have problems. I'll try to fix them). Restart your mac again, and hold Option. Select the Mac drive to go back into MacOS. Now follow these steps here, from Ubuntu Tutorials. It should explain everything more clearly than me.\nStep 9: I don't have any screenshots, but it should be just a simple \"follow the steps on the screen\" type of thing.

A drive can\n  have more than one EFI partition. Additional EFI partitions do not\n  have to reside at the beginning of the drive.\n\nhere is some info (I will make edits shortly when I have more time):\nAn EFI partition (sometimes referred to as an ESP partition) is nothing more than a msdos formatted partition at the beginning of your drive. Contained in this partition is an EFI folder. Within that EFI folder, is the apple bootloader (the same thing as refind, but made by Apple). When you format any drive on a mac using disk utility with apfs or hfs+ filesystem, your mac automatically creates an EFI partition on that drive. However, it only installs the bootloader on your main internal drive. This means, that any disk utility externally formatted mac drive contains an efi partition, but your mac does not use it because within that partition, there is no EFI folder or bootloader. It is essentially completely unused.\nWhen you install refind to an external disk on its EFI partition, you are essentially installing a non-apple bootloader on that drive. When your mac boots, it will look for a bootloader. When you have 2 different bootloaders (Mac OS default bootloader + refind) on two different drives, in two different EFI partitions, it can create unnecessary complications. Although This scenario is still possible, and will work, it is completely unnecessary, redundant, and confusing (for your mac). That being said, I would strongly advise to back up your original bootloader on your main hard drives EFI partition (as simple as making a duplicate copy of the original EFI folder inside the EFI partition using finder), and then installing refind to that drives EFI partition. This will eliminate confusing your mac in a dual/tripple boot scenario. To reinstall your macs original boot configuration, just deleted the EFI folder with refind on it, and rename your backup EFI folder (EFI Copy) to EFI. \nEDIT:\nNow that I think about it, I havent messed with refind and bootloaders and bootmanagers (refind) on macs for a while. So the above answer i posted is actually not totally correct. Bootloaders/bootmanagers on macs are a lot less complicated then they actually seem, but there are definitely things to consider particular to your setup. Macs DO overwrite refind when upgrading your os and sometimes on updates as well. This requires you to reinstall refind, or touch refind on your mac to indicate that it is the default bootmanager. I prefer just reinstalling since its automated and easy.\nIf you want more information on why i recommend just installing refind to your main hard drive and how it could complicate things otherwise, i would strongly you read the refind documentation from the developer (smart and great guy) at http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/. \nBe sure to read up on the sections about disabling sip before installing http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/sip.html\nAfter reading through all the documentation, if you still do not have a grasp on things, you could try emailing the developer with further questions. But be sure you understand the documentation as best as possible before you bother a busy man with something that is possibly already documented. \n", "Q: How to stop SilentCleanServer app from running I have an old iMac running High Sierra. Using Activity Monitor I noticed that I have an app named SilentCleanServer running  This program is using some CPU time and it has over 2,000 files associated with it.

I have just seen the most remarkable thing in a deep corner of my large archive disk: a single directory containing two entries (subdirectories) with the same name and same inode number.\n% ls -liaF path/to/directory/with/duplicate/entries\ntotal 56\n1227293 drwxr-xr-x  1 jdlh  staff    264  3 Jan  2016 ./\n1227288 drwxr-xr-x  1 jdlh  staff    264  3 Jan  2016 ../\n1227364 drwxr-xr-x  1 jdlh  staff    264 20 Feb  2009 .externalToolBuilders/\n1227364 drwxr-xr-x  1 jdlh  staff    264 20 Feb  2009 .externalToolBuilders/\n1227367 -rw-rw-rw-  1 jdlh  staff    859 20 Feb  2009 other_files\n\nThere are two entries named externalToolBuilders/ in this directory. They appear to share the same inode number, so they refer to the same thing, not just to two things which share the same name. \nWhen I try to copy this directory to another file system volume using Finder, I get an error that \"a directory with the name .externalToolBuilders already exists\". The copy aborts at that point. I can refer to both entries with a single wildcard like diff -rq .ext*, and the command treats this as expanding to two arguments.\nHowever, I can use some command line commands like cp -r, referring to the duplicate subdirectory, and only one of the entries gets copied. \nIt looks like this directory was expanded from a .zip archive. It is possible that the .zip archive was constructed incorrectly to have two entries with the same name, that the archive utility did not catch the mistake, but that Finder did.\n[Update after more investigation: the problem is observed in directories which were not expanded from a .zip archive. The problem is observed in several locations, but all observed examples are on a volume hosted by a QNAP Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliance, served to Mac OS through netatalk AFP support.]\nHas anyone seen this on a Mac OS file system before? I find it most curious. How can it be constructed at will? Are there known drawbacks of it? How can one clean it up? \n\nA: I finally figured out the underlying cause. The following is adapted from my blog post with my findings. \nI connected to the shell of the original server's underlying Linux operating system. I looked at the corresponding directory in the server's underlying file system. This is what I saw (bowlderised for confidentiality and simplified for clarity):\n% ls -la /share/Volume/path/to/directory/with/duplicate/entries\ntotal 56\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 myuser  everyone      4096 Jan  3  2016 ./\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 myuser  everyone      4096 Aug 24 00:21 ../\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 myuser  everyone      4096 Aug 24 01:32 .externalToolBuilders/\ndrwxr-xr-x  1 myuser  everyone      4096 Feb 20  2009 :2eexternalToolBuilders/\n-rw-rw-rw-  1 myuser  everyone      4096 Feb 20  2009 other_files\n\nThe crucial observation is the directory name, :2eexternalToolBuilders. It begins with the string \":2e\", while the other directory entry begins with the string \".\". From the point of view of the underlying operating system and file system, there are no duplicate entries in this directory. The two \"externalToolBuilder\" directories have different names. \nThe layers of software on top of the server's operating system — quite probably the netatalk AFP software — interpret the prefix \":2e\" as standing for \".\". When presenting the underlying directory entry :2eexternalToolBuilders through AFP to my Mac, it rewrites the entry's name to .externalToolBuilders . It fails to notice that there is another entry named .externalToolBuilders in that directory. The result is that my Mac sees, in the original server, a directory with an unexpected, and rule-violating, duplication.\nI suspect that the use of prefix \":2e\" in place of prefix \".\" is a convention from old Server Message Block (SMB) file server software.  SMB allowed Mac OS files to be stored on underlying Windows file systems. The Windows file system of the time did not permit filenames with a leading \".\". \"2e\" can be read as a hex ASCII code for period \".\". The colon \":\" can be read as an escape character, meaning that it plus the following two hex digits should be presented as the character represented by the digits. Thus \":2e\" in an underlying directory entry name stands for \".\" in the directory entry name presented by the server. \nIt turns out that the data on the original server was old enough to have been copied forward through multiple versions of server and server software. Sometimes I accessed it through SMB, and other times through AFP. I expect that the directory :2eexternalToolBuilders was created first, and the companion directory .externalToolBuilders was created later. They coexisted, especially for old data which I didn't access. Only when I used Finder to copy the directory did the conflict become apparent.\nI speculate that the inconsistent behaviour I saw on my Mac, looking at the volume presented through AFP, is caused by Mac OS utilities treating directory entries differently depending on whether they look up a specific name in a directory, or enumerate all names.  The software no doubt assumed there can be no duplicate names among the entries. Utilities looking for a specific name will find one or other of the duplicates, and stop. There is no reason to look for another of that name, because none should exist. Utilities enumerating all names, or all names matching a wildcard, return all matching entries, not caring that some are duplicates. The duplicate inode number can be explained by the software enumerating all names, then for each name, using that name to look up the inode number corresponding to that name. The software returning inode numbers would of course end its search with the same directory entry both times, because it was looking for the same name both times.\nThe solution for me was to patrol the underlying filesystem of my original server, looking for cases of duplicates separated by \".\" and \":2e\" prefixes. I found about five cases, with names like .externalToolBuilders, .svn, .libs, and .metadata. I used shell command to merge all files into the entry with the \".\" prefix, then delete the entry with the \":2e\" prefix. This removed the duplication, and let the Finder copy succeed.\n", "Q: Some app or service block macbook from locking I have default settings for sleep mode.

I am in the process of dismantling an old macOS High Sierra Server and rebuilding it as a macOS Mojave Server.\nI've exported Users and Groups from OpenDirectory on the old one and imported them in the new one.\nI could move the user's home folders by shutting the old system down, mounting it in Target Disk Mode on the other and using ditto.\nBut suppose I do not want that and I want both to keep running (e.g. because the old one is still providing services such as mail and DNS) as the new server is still in buildup and contents on it are experimental (final copy done before going live on the new one).

It manifested after the installation of a driver with an unsigned .kext file.  In this instance, it was from this driver (Roland DJ-202 DRIVER VER.1.0.3). \nAt the time I didn't think this was causing the issue because this driver was installed and ran fine on a friend's MacBook Pro running on Mojave. The difference was that his machine is running 10.14.3 and mine is running 10.14.6. It seems that this driver does not work on macOS Mojave 10.14.6.\nI discovered the issue after reading through this.

Continue holding Cmd + R until you see the loading bar. It should load into the Recovery Menu.\nOpen Disk Utility and choose Verify Disk. If that says it needs to be repaired, click the Repair Disk button.

When using Disk Utility to format a cheap slow thumb-drive (USB flash drive), is Apple File System (APFS) now the appropriate Format to choose over the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) that previously was commonly used?\nThis drive is for use on Macs running Mojave and Catalina.  \nThe tech note from Apple, How to erase a disk for Mac, is not clear on this issue.\n\n\nA: Sure, there’s no HDD type mechanism so you have no reason to not use APFS other than interoperability concerns. Your article references managing the “start up disk” - are you using these to run an OS or store files?\nApple at WWDC prepared has some great videos / PDF version of the slide deck and since you're on Flash, you'd need a good/specific reason not to choose APFS in my eyes.\n\nThe Apple File System (APFS) is a modern file system, optimized for responsiveness on Flash/SSD storage, and designed for extensibility, security, and data integrity. APFS is now the default filesystem on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS.\n\nThe SSD optimizations won’t hurt on flash controllers and might help for any Mac centric work pattern.\nThe only down side would be file recovery software, but being able to snapshot the disk might help there.\n", "Q: Spam (or just email) filters in iOS Mail.app I know that iOS' Mail.app doesn't do automatic spam filtering. However, my ISP's spam filter is quite good, so it automatically marks all suspicious emails with \"[SPAM]\" on the Subject line. Thus, I'm looking for some way to have iOS' Mail  filter automatically move mails with that expression in the Subject to the Junk folder.\nIt would seem like a basic feature; I mean, mail programs from 20 years ago had this (filter automatically mails according to sender, Subject line or whatever), but I haven't been able to find it. Does it even exist?\nEDIT: if possible, I'm looking for an automated way to filter email. We all know already how to manually find and remove unwanted messages, but the whole point of using computers is to save work, after all...\n\nA: This is definitely something they should have implemented by now since large umbers of people are now using their smart phones as their primary email reader.\nCurrently, this is how I'd do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*In iOS Mail tap on the Search field at top of screen\n\n*Type [SPAM] in the search field\n\n*The screen will show results under various headings\n\n*Swipe up until you see the Subjects heading\n\n*Now tap on the Subject contains: [SPAM] option\n\n*This will bring up all results matching that criteria\n\n*Now tap on the blue Edit option at bottom right of the screen\n\n*Select all emails\n\n*Tap on Mark > Move to Junk\n\n\nHowever, you may be able to achieve a more automated approach by creating a Shortcut with the Shortcuts app. I'm heading out now for a most of the day, but if I get a chance I'll try and create a shortcut and edit my answer to explain how I created it.\nIn the meantime, if you'd like to explore this as an option and you don't already have the app installed, you can download Shortcuts from the App Store.\n\nA: Sieve\nDo you know if your ISP supports server side Sieve filters?\nIf so, you can set up rules that are independent of the e-mail client you use. With Sieve, the rules are performed on the server. This allows you to use any e-mail client, including those without filtering/rule support.\nE-mail providers such as FastMail and Gandi both support sieve.\n", "Q: How to configure Apple Mail on iPhone XR (iOS 12.4) to download emails from mailserver but not delete them on it? I keep my mailfile on my laptop which uses a mail client to download and send email through my mailserver. When I download email it is then deleted from the server. I can also read and send mail using webmail access to the same server, but when I read it using that method it is not then deleted - it is only deleted later when I download it using my mail client. The mailfile is backed up but not synced, and nowhere is the cloud involved.\nObviously I can read and send mail from my iPhone using a web browser such as Safari.\nMy question is whether I can also configure Apple Mail to download mail from the server such that it is not then deleted on the server. The reason I ask is that I would sometimes like to read emails on my iPhone before I have downloaded them on the laptop. I would then eventually delete them by hand on the iPhone because they would later get downloaded and filed in the usual way on my laptop. But of course they can only get downloaded to the laptop so long as the contact with the server using Apple Mail doesn't cause them to be deleted on the server.\nI suspect the answer is \"No - if you want to handle your mail that way, then when you read it on your iPhone your should only use webmail access through a web browser\". I may be wrong, though.\n\nA: Sure. Have Apple mail client use IMAP protocol to leave a copy on the server and just don’t delete on iOS. \nNext time your machine deletes things off the server, the next IMAP sync will clean up things on the iPhone automagically. \n", "Q: Has Unix Parameter Name SystemAudioVolume Been Changed to SystemAudioVolume DB in El Capitan?

Does anyone know the proper range for this?\nMy computer is old but I don't want to break it.\n\nA: Firstly, the sudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%00 (or the same command with different values at end) never allowed users to actually change the startup chime sound. In earlier versions of Mac OS X it did allow users to change the volume, and therefore they could mute the startup chime, but this did not change the sound.\nThe closest thing to changing the sound is a hack that allowed users to mute the startup chime and then add another sound that occurred upon logging in to your user account - but of course this is not a startup sound, just a sound that plays when you log into your user account.\nAs for whether SystemAudioVolume has been replaced with SystemAudioVolumeDB, the answer is no. In fact, as you have seen from running sudo nvram -p, these two parameters have totally different values.\nSummary\n\n\n*\n\n*No, the Unix parameter SystemAudioVolume has not been replaced by SystemAudioVolume DB in El Capitan\n\n*The Unix parameter SystemAudioVolume has never been used to change the startup chime sound - only to change the volume level\n\n*The startup chime sound cannot be changed\n\n\nFurther reading\nThese related questions may interest you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable OS X startup sound\n\n*How can I silence the startup chime on El Capitan?\n", "Q: How to set Xcode as core.editor in git?

However, in Disk utility the amount of free memory didn't change and is still only around 85GB and it is still not possible to partition the disk. \n\n*I deleted 2/3 automatic time machine backups with\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\ntmutil deletelocalsnapshots ...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*deactivated the automatic time machine backups with\n\n\nsudo tmutil disable localsnapshot\n\nWhat should I do?\nEDIT\nHere is the screenshot from diskutil where the problem is appearing: \n\n\nA: is it an apfs vol?\ndid u try to partition the volume without a specified format?\nplease post more info !!\noff the top of my head i can think of a couple of things, mainly \ndiskutil eraseVolume /dev/diskXY (where X= the disk and 1 the volume within that disk) \"Free Space\" \"%noformat%\" <desired amount, %, or if you've already created a separate volume use the R option or 100% in order to erase the entire volume>\n\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 1 GPT \"Free Space\" \"%noformat%\" \"100%\" \nor format it as a FAT32 part and use that for linux(its been a while since i've done this myself; but i can find u some resources if u'd like...)\n\n\n\ncheck the man pages, man diskutil \nalso what mac are u using?(make model and what not ... it might be handier to install refit/refind and use that as boot manager before installing ubuntu so that your mac will always boot up into a \n     custom bootloader with a choice of operating systems).\nif none of these are viable options or you'd rather not mess with the bootloader, why not just install vmware fusion, virtualbox and use ubuntu as a virtual machine (depending on what you'll be using it for, not too much resources need to be allocated; i'd start off with 2cpu and around 2048-4096mb of ram[this, of course, is dependent on what you're initial resources are...if u're running an old dual core processor and only have 4G of ddr3 ram, then the initial option with refind/dedicated partition might be the way to go.])\nWhat will u be using ubuntu for? \nHave you created a liveusb and booted into ubuntu already ?! Are you familiar with linux?!\n\n\n", "Q: How can I specify a minimum font size for viewing email in Apple Mail? Similar questions have been asked in the past, albeit not in the last five years, it would seem, and the Mail application has changed enough to make the answers to those older questions entirely irrelevant. For instance, there is no longer a messages.css to edit in Mail.app's resources directory and defaults write com.apple.mail MinimumHTMLFontSize 12 does not have any effect, although the strings command confirms that specific key still exists in the executable.\nIn Preferences, you can change the font and font size, but that's for composing email. \nHow can I set a minimum or default font size for viewing received email in the preview pane? I am aware that HTML email is now the de facto standard and that Mail is probably using the font size specified in the HTML tags or CSS. However, if browsers can resize a webpage and I am fairly sure Mail is using a WebView internally, then it would stand to reason that it can be done. Whether this is a user-accessible option is, of course, another matter. \n\nA: At the top of the Mail app, there is a toolbar as shown below.\n\nAs shown above, there are buttons to increase and decrease the size of the font. If these buttons do not appear on your mail viewer you can edit the toolbar by going to the View menu item and selecting 'Customize the Toolbar'. When you click on this you get the panel shown below.\n\nThe red line on this image is directly below the icons for increasing and decreasing the font size. Adding these to your toolbar will enable you to change the font size for any mail message you view. This is same as ankiiiiiii's answer bit a different way of implementing it.\nAnother option which may stick is to go to Preferences under the Mail menu item. Once the Preferences pane appears, click on the 'Fonts and Colors' tab near the top of the panel. This brings open a panel where you can set the font size and font color.\n\nA: the only 'fix' I've found is to map F15 to a keyboard maestro script to run the following AppleScript. Just one key press the get things legible (for me) again.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key down command\n    key code 24\n    key code 24\n    key code 24\n    key up command\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Mess with multiples Emacs distros (Homebrew)? I have recently got a new copy of Emacs on a brand new macOS setup as follows, using the Homebrew package manager:\nbrew cask install emacs\n\nI also wanted to try Emacs Mac Port, so I fired up my terminal and typed\nbrew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport\nbrew install emacs-mac\n\nbut lot of symlinking error appeared.\nI thought it was a bad idea to let Homebrew manage so similar packages, and removed emacs and emacs-mac with brew cask uninstall emacs and brew uninstall emacs-mac.\nHave I done a mess? Should I have done something else other than brew cleanup and brew doctor, before installing again the standard Emacs distro with brew cask install emacs?\n\nA: If you don't want to use Homebrew, you don't have to. This is really a matter of taste. You can use Homebrew or not. You can build the application from source or you can download from GNU here or Emacs For Mac OS X here - both yield the latest versions.\nIf you want to use Homebrew, I recommend that you use:\nbrew install emacs\n\nthen link the binary if you want to run from terminal, this can be performed via:\nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/26.2/Emacs.app /Applications\n\nIf you don't want to use Homebrew, use one of the binaries listed above. Keep in mind you can always link them later if you want to run the latest version from the command line.\n", "Q: Power nap is disabled, iMac still wakes in the night to black screen, but with backlight on I have a 2017 5k iMac, running latest Mojave (10.14.6).

I had to erase my hard drive and restore it from backups. The one thing I’m having trouble restoring is the drive’s custom icon. I have a Time Machine backup that includes the .VolumeIcon.icns file that was in the root directory of the hard drive, but this file itself doesn’t have a custom icon, so it’s not possible to do the usual “copy the icon from one file’s Get Info window and paste it into the other file’s Get Info window” routine.\nHow can I take the icon from a .icns file and “paste” it onto another folder or file?\n\nA: Using Finder go to the folder where the icns file is located. Open this icns file using Preview. Once the file is open click on select all in the edit menu item. Once you've selected all, open a file in Pages and paste the image in the new or old file.  This file now contains the image.\n\nA: I ended up opening doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the icns file in GraphicConverter.\n\n*Select Edit → Select All (or press Command-A) to select the entire image.\n\n*Select Edit → Copy → Copy (or press Command-C) to copy the image.\n\n*In the Finder, select Go → Computer (or press Command-Shift-C) to navigate to Computer.\n\n*Click on the hard drive you want to copy the icon to.\n\n*Select File → Get Info (or press Command-I) to open the info window.\n\n*Click on the small “proxy icon” to the left of the drive’s name.\n\n*Select Edit → Paste (or press Command-V) to replace the drive’s current icon with the copied image. You may be prompted for an administrator password if you’re changing a drive icon.\n\n\nThe same procedure works on ordinary files and folders, too, not just drives.\n\nA: The issue seems to be that you first need an original app/file/folder with that icon in order to Get Info and copy the icon to the intended destination.\nI would suggest using Automator to create your own dummy \"Application\", assigning the icon. Once you have that application, you can copy the file to your Volume.\n\nRename your icon to AutomatorApplet.icns, then add it to the Resources folder of your Automator app.\n\nExplained here:\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/370/19829\nCreate an Application via Automator:\n\n", "Q: iPhone frequently asks \"Trust this computer?\" upon connection to Mac Often, when I connect my iPhone 7 to my MacBook Pro 2018 (using a new Apple Store-supplied USB cable), the iPhone prompts \"Trust this computer?\". I tap \"Yes\", and then have to enter my six digit pass code on the iPhone.\nIt's happening more than 50% of the time, probably 60-80% from eyeballing.\ni.e. Not every time. It's not 100% repeatable.  But I've just tried disconnecting and reconnecting 10 times and 7 times I got this prompt.\nThis is beginning to infuriate me.  Is there any step I can take towards diagnosing?\nEDIT: It is worth noting that the cable does work. I am able to transfer data between the computer and phone. So it appears the issue is not related to the cable.\nEDIT: I've noticed this only occurs when I have hotspot enabled!\n\nA: Most likely lint.\nThe lightning connector is prone to collecting dust and dirt, which can keep the phone from getting a clean signal from the cable (a faulty or not-to-spec cable can have the same effect). Take a toothpick or anything else that's thin and non-conducting and get that dust bunny out.\nNever believe anyone telling you to reboot all devices and reinstall all operating systems in your house.\n", "Q: Does macOS show battery health for third-party replacement batteries? My late 2013 13\" retina MacBook Pro's battery is on its last legs, and I need to replace it soon.  I'm thinking of buying a replacement battery kit from iFixit, and I'm wondering if macOS will be able to show battery health (as in the image below) for the new battery, considering that it'll be a third-party battery.  Can anyone let me know about this?\n\n\nA: The batteries I have used from iFixit do show the battery health and work functionally the same as the apple battery.  I have yet to be disappointed in my purchases from iFixit.\n", "Q: Profile app won't verify Problem\nI am a jailbreaker, having used Unc0ver to jailbreak my phone. But I cant verify the profile.

Being on Wi-Fi doesn't seem to make a difference, although I did take my phone camping and that's when it first stopped trusting the profile.\nResearch\nI have tried to look at other forums on this website, but they didn't help because they were talking about illegal apps (such as AppValley and PandaHelper).\nHow might I try resolving this?\n\nA: The profile for the jailbreak was revoked by Apple, and you need to reinstall the app from wherever you installed it.\nI would recommend using ignition.fun to install it again. The ignition.fun website will say at the top whether their applications are signed or not, which will tell you if you can install apps such as unc0ver from the website or not.\nIf you don't want to have to deal with the jailbreak apps being revoked, you can install the tweak ReProvision from the repository https://repo.incendo.ws which will allow you to automatically resign apps using your Apple ID.\n", "Q: How to view iPhone Safari developer tools on Mac over WiFi?

So, Mojave appears to background all of your windows when you unplug. Then you re-plug and suddenly all your windows are out of order.\nThe energy saver options don't seem to have anything related to the windowing. I'm trying to turn this off so my windows stop vanishing, especially since I'm usually developing and debugging and suddenly-disappearing IDE doesn't help with the simulator.\n\nA: The problem appears to be Parallels Toolbox. To turn it off, you have to go into the settings for Parallels Toolbox, which is in the upper-right of the main window for it, then uncheck Energy Saver. There are about 2 other areas with energy saver options, but they just turn it on/leave it on.\nHitting Cancel on one of the other screens tricked me into thinking it was off, so ensure to follow instructions above.\n", "Q: Really strange behavior creating a directory on SMB NAS share I am setting up a Synology DS918+ for backing up a new iMac Pro with an Drobo 5D3 attached to it.\nI was working on backing up my Photos library from the Drobo using ChronoSync. ChronoSync was aborting with an error and after some debugging I can see what is happening, but its weird and I was hoping someone could help explain it.\nTo verify this is the issue I created a new SMB3 share on the Synology called Test and mounted it.

I solved it by mounting the drive using AFP instead of SMB, and that meant that I could see files called AUX again.

I'm about to change my power adapter's cable due to the classic cable fraying.\nHowever, according to this, there's data that gets passed around using the 1-Wire protocol.\nI only see 2 wires on there.\nIs the cable a \"smart\" cable with a built-in IC, or are all logic and data pieces in the charger brick itself?\n\nA: The charger's serialization and capabilities are determined by the chip in the Magsafe connector.  The Mac also controls the LED, not the charger.\n\nUnderstanding the charger's ID code\nYou can easily pull up the charger information on a Mac (Go to \"About this Mac\", \"More Info...\", \"System Report...\", \"Power\"), but much of the information is puzzling. The wattage and serial number make sense, but what about the ID, Revision, and Family? It turns out that these are part of the 1-Wire protocol used by the chip inside the connector.\n\n\nA: There's no built-in IC inside the cable. All the logic behind the 1-Wire protocol happens inside the computer, the charging brick and the MagSafe connector.\nYou can see a teardown of the MagSafe / MagSafe 2 connectors on the link below, where the actual communication process is also explained:\nhttp://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html\n", "Q: iCloud Keychain out of sync after Mac user password change on my macOS Mojave 10.14.5 (18F132), where I'm logged in with my iCloud account, if I perform a domain Mac user password change (from System Preferences) then the iCloud Keychain sync will be turned off.

It is possible to have a cable that only works in one direction due to a hardware problem.\n", "Q: iOS app missing keyboard language selection I am having an issue with an iOS application which doesn't allow choosing between configured iOS keyboard languages except for English and Emoji\nThe very same app (in this case, Bolt) shows the language selection normally on my wife's device.\nI've had the issue before with some other apps, but that happens rarely so I don't recall which apps they were. In either case, it doesn't seem a problem with an app, as on other devices the language selection looks fine.\nHere is the screenshot from Bolt and Uber, running on the same device.\nI have searched the internet but couldn't find other reports of the same issue, probably due to many other topics around the same keywords.\n\n\n\nA: If I understand correctly, you are saying the keyboard languages show up properly in all Apps except a few. Is this right? Are you connected to the internet when the problem occurs? I ask because some language items (e.g., voice dictation) only work properly when an internet connection is available (sometimes you can't even see the mic, shown in your image). Like you, I have 4 languages installed (although I removed emojis). At times I've experienced problems (though different from yours) and I did something like the following to solve them:\n1) remove each keyboard language (except native) via settings-->general-->keyboards\n2) restarted the device\n3) re-added each keyboard language via settings-->general-->keyboards\n\nIn your case, I suggest you delete the problem App(s) before step (3) and then re-add them after step (3)\nIf you are able to see the language keyboards in most Apps (Mail, Notes, etc...) but just not in some problem Apps, I would contact the developer, sending them a screenshot.\n", "Q: how to resend a imessage containing URLs on IOS 12.4?

Now, whenever I go to the next slide, I see a blurred version first which seems to be a cached image of the slide (nowhere near vector graphics) and then the page renders to smooth and clear text. I am using a 2018 MacBook Pro so I am assuming that hardware is not a bottleneck here.\nIs preview designed to behave in this way? Can this behaviour be changed?\nClarification: I am not referring to the transition animation when changing pages using the trackpad. I change pages using the keyboard and the blurring looks like an actual rendering delay.\n\nA: In short: Preview cannot be changed. The problem is not one at the application level, but in the way that MacOS's Quartz engines renders images. For some reason, the OS 'sharpens the focus' of the image over half a second or so.\nIt may be possible to change the parameters of such animated effects for a given application, but it will only be possible in Preview if Apple's developers have included a mechanism to do so within the app. None is documented and it seems unlikely that Apple would go to such trouble.\nIf you don't like the effect, then leave Feedback for Apple. You may prefer to use another viewing app, but it will have to use different image rendering libraries from those present in MacOS.\n(Apropos of nothing, I'm currently writing a replacement app to make up for Preview's shortcomings, and I haven't found any method of changing this animation. Yet.)\n\nA: I am facing the same issue. What follows may not be considered an \"answer\" by some people, but may lead to an answer I think and I've never seen it mentionned on the numerous web pages complaining about this issue : I've noticed that when you open the pdf not with Preview BUT with the built-in previewer from finder (the one you obtain when clicking on SpceBar when file highlighted in the finder) then you can scroll through the pages (using PageDown PageUpp, or Fn+Arrows) and this ugly effect does not show. This is very surprising as I've always assumed (and I'm not alone I guess) that this builtin finder preview was using the same toolkit as Preview, which is not the case apparenlty.\n", "Q: How to allow someone to turn off my device the purpose of my question , I need someone to remotely turn off my device\nbecause I wont be in front of my Laptop\nI succeeded in giving him a terminal command to shutdown my PC \n\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to shut down'\n\nbut the issue here (the below image) \n= there's opening apps which open a dialog (Terminate processes , would like to review) ?\nand waiting for input/interaction from me\nI wont be in front of my Laptop , so I need this solution to by force immediately shutdown the device without these dialogs - without depending on action by me\n\n\nA: Easier, but sacrifices security\nCreate an admin account for him on the system.  \nHave him type \nsudo -u his_short_user_name shutdown -h now\n\nHe then answers a password challenge with his password, and the system does a \"somewhat hard\" shutdown.  This means apps will not be asked about saving application data, so your half finished Illustrator drawing is gone.  \nBetter security\nAt Terminal, you write a bit of perl to wait for his shutdown request.  You launch it after every reboot with sudo perl program_name.  When you do, it'll challenge you for your password, and then run as superuser.  When it comes time to shutdown, it's already authenticated so it just does it. \n  my $signal_file = \"/Users/(you)/Public/Drop Box/shutdown\";\n  unlink ($signal_file); \n\n  while (1) { \n    sleep(10);\n    next if not -f $signal_file;\n    system ”shutdown -h now\";\n  }\n\nAnd your guest needs to simply touch '/Users/(you)/Public/Drop Box/shutdown' to trigger a shutdown.  He doesn't need any special rights to do this.  For instance you could publish your Public directory as a network share point, a perfectly reasonable thing to do from a security POV.  \nIf you want to temporarily prevent a user from doing this, either kill the process (ctrl-C) or create a directory there called shutdown.   Note that perl is testing for -f (presence of file). \n\nA: Use the following command:\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nThis will kill all open processes and shut down the Mac, without any warnings shown.\n", "Q: Restart the computer when the system freeze I'm working on a code but sometimes the memory gets full and the system freeze.

But I don’t understand what rm -rf $(!!) will do on the command line.\nHow can I look up this syntax or understand what it will do?\n\nA: *\n\n*!! is a history command of bash, it gets replaced by the last command you‘ve executed. You can try ls followed by echo !!\n\n*$(...) performs Command Substitution, the output of a command replaces the command name (the part within the ()). Again, echo $(!!) helps to illustrate this\n\n\nSo rm $(!!) removes all files whose names are printed after re-running the last command. Watch out for file names containing spaces or special characters like * or ? or ~; it won‘t work for those, or it will remove a different set of files than you’d think. \nGiven the risks it's probably safer to run echo PATTERN, verify the result and then go back one line in the history, replace echo by rm and execute this. Instead of navigating back you can also just run ^echo^rm^ (which uses history expansion to replace the command used in the line before).\n", "Q: Trying to install fonts to Font Book (Mac) using the Terminal I've been trying to add \"official company Fonts\" to my DeployStudio workflow imaging new Macs.

This just a workaround, I would greatly appreciate it if someone helped me solve this puzzle. \n\nA: The shell uses a space character as a separator between words, so paths containing spaces always must be put in \"\" when used (which implies that it is recommended/best practice to ensure that all paths and file names in shell scripts and init files are properly quoted):\nANKI_MEDIA=\"/Users/<username>/Library/Application\\ Support/Anki2/me/collection.media\"\ncd \"$ANKI_MEDIA\"\n\nYou can also use \\ to protect a space but this only works for literal paths, not for variables:\ncd /Users/<username>/Library/Application\\ Support/Anki2/me/collection.media\n\nIf applying quotes each time you change into this directory is inconvenient you can use an alias instead:\nalias cdanki=\"cd '$ANKI_MEDIA'\"\n\n\nA: There was a mistake on the pathfile name (after Anki2/me/...) : the user profile was actually \"me_201908\".

In other words, it can be written to expressly target .jpg files where the extension is lower case as in your example, e.g.: 2012-04-05 19.21.34.jpg\n\n\n*\n\n*Replacing the *.* in for f in *.*; do ...; done with: in *.jpg\n\n*Replacing the [a-z].* in sed -e 's:\\.[a-z].*::' with: jpg\nfor f in *.jpg; do touch -t $(sed -e 's:\\.jpg::' -e 's:\\.::' -e 's:[- ]::g'<<<\"$f\") \"$f\"; done\n\nSince the -t option is being used with the touch command, any filename that doesn't produce the expected output, the worst case scenario with it written a bit loose is its not going to impact non-target files and will simply error out on those files with:\ntouch: out of range or illegal time specification: [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]\n\nSo, written a bit loose or more targeted, the end results will be the same and, only files with the naming convention of e.g. 2012-04-05 19.21.34.jpg will be touched.\n\nNOTE: Always make sure you have a current backup before wholesale processing files.\n", "Q: Receiving spam email from my own iCloud account and my own IP address I found a thread with a similar problem but it didn't seem to have a solution for this situation, so here goes:\nI have, on 3 occasions now, received spam email (iPhone XS fake promos) to my personal Gmail account from my own iCloud account.\nThese emails have only been sent when my Mac is turned on. They show up in my iCloud account's \"Sent\" folder within the Mail app. I have verified that they have come from the IP address of my Mac. These emails have gone to my personal Gmail account and to no other addresses within my contact list. My Apple login is secured with 2FA and there have been no abnormal login attempts.\nI share the Mac with family and it is possible that a ..questionable.. piece of software was installed by my son (pirated version of an app from a torrent site).

I am currently using the latest Catalina public beta. I looked into Malwarebytes and it is not yet compatible.\nThank you in advance for any help you can offer!\n\nA: I believe I've figured this out. This is the well known Gcal spam, but in my case, at least, and I assume @derpymcderpson's case, the Google calendar is linked to Calendar.app (formerly iCal). That means that an email alarm from Calendar when the Gcal spam is added sends an email from your primary email account using Apple Mail (or, more specifically, MailServiceAgent). No hacking. Just unfortunate behavior.

But I can't find a way to do that in mac. If I have hundreds of files in one category, say, Images, I have to scroll all the way to reach the next one (movies, documents etc). If this is not possible in finder, is there any alternative?\nEdit: To be clear, I'm wondering if there's a way to expand/collapse the group headers (eg: Images, movies, documents etc) and not folders.\n\nA: None of the groupings allows you to collapse/expand folder in List view. So to facilitate quick grouping, (I forgot defaults) go to View menu -> customise toolbar and include the  icon in toolbar.\n\n*\n\n*You can group by None and then later set Sort by to Kind. It will not allow \"Kind\" groups to be collapsed, but allows the same for folders, at least.\n\n\n*After your edit, I am prompted to suggest the Icon view and Group by Kind.

I don't know why this is so obtuse and hidden from users, but here's my issue. I'm using a Signature generator to produce our company's email signatures but we have users across most of the major platforms. Other mail clients seem to behave well, but pasting the signature generator's output in Mac Mail on Mojave fails, and the signature design is broken. All the mac's being targeted are running Mojave.\nFor my process here, I have 1) copied the generated signature, 2) opened preferences in Mail, 3) created a new signature, 4) unclicked the default font option, closed the preferences tab. When I add the signature to a message the design is changed to the point of unusability.\nAlternatively, I have also tried the creating a placeholder signature method (by creating an empty signature with no default font, identifying the signature file in the library and the replacing the body tags and locking the file) as well as just copying over the signature files. Each method either produces bad results and it's unclear why (even worse changes to the design) or no results at all.\nSo...how do I easily copy and edit mail signatures for multiple users.\n\nA: A theoretical solution...\nI find my Mac Mail signatures are stored in the folder at ~/Library/Mail/V6/MailData/Signatures. You may be able to copy the contents of the folder at this location from one computer to another.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hit ⇧⌘G (or Go > Go to Folder... in the Finder) and enter ~/Library/Mail/V6/MailData on the computer that has the signatures you wish to copy. Locate the \"Signatures\" folder, and copy it over to your target computer.\n\n*Then (on the target computer), navigate to the same ~/Library/Mail/V6/MailData location, replace the Signatures folder (if present) with the version you copied. \n\n*Open up Mail and check if the signatures are there.\nTwo warnings:\n\n\n*\n\n*I haven't tested this, so it might not work/it might mess things up. Make sure you have a backup copy of the signatures folder from your target computer before overwriting it so you can revert if anything goes wrong.\n\n*If there are already custom signatures on the target computer, they will be overwritten.\n\nA: Building on Michael Noguera's answer, I was able to transfer just one signature. Some file copying and maybe editing are required.\nOn the Mac where the signature already exists, look in ~/Library/Mail/V5/MailData/Signatures (yours may not be V5 but pick the most recent). \nIf the destination Mac has no signatures yet, just copy the entire file AllSignatures.plist. If the destination has some and you want to preserve them, you need to go into the file AllSignatures.plist, find the signature you want by looking at the SignatureName field. Copy that entire XML <dict> ... </dict> block to the destination Mac's AllSignatures.plist file (your destination Mac may have a different version path, i.e. V7, but that's ok).\nNow you need to copy the signature itself. In that dict block, there is a field named SignatureUniqueID and the field after it is a long hex string. Look for a file in that directory with the same name as the hex string. Copy that to your destination Mac's Signatures folder.\nQuit Mail and restart it. But you may not be quite done.\nIn my version of Mail (version 13.0), when I opened Preferences --> Signatures, I could see my copied signature in the All Signatures list but it was not associated with one of my mail accounts. I dragged the name of the signature from the middle column to the account name in the left column. Then, when I try to send a new mail from that account, it finally showed up in the possible signatures list.\n", "Q: In the Notes app (iOS 12.4), how to remove \"All on my iPhone\", \"Notes\", and \"Recently Deleted\" folders In the Notes app, which I am using offline, say I write a note and I put it in a folder I create called \"Ool's Folder\". Say I then delete the note and create another one.\nAt this point, I have four (!) folders showing, namely \"All on My iPhone\", \"Notes\", \"Ool's Folder\", and \"Recently Deleted\".\nHow can I get only a single folder showing, namely \"Ool's Folder\". I have tried the method of swiping left to delete, but this only works on \"Ool's Folder\" and not on any of three folders that I would actually like to delete.\n\nA: As long as there are notes in Recently Deleted, the folder will be there. \nThere's nothing much you can do about system folders. I tend to ignore them unless required. Or not make a folder at all. This keeps everything simplified(relatively). \n", "Q: My iPhone / apple account might be hacked/ infected, looking for clarification and advice Today I accidentally opened the Mail App on my iPhone after many years, never used it but it is connected to my apple ID/ iCloud. When it opened I noticed it had around 40 emails started. Each one was a 'compose a new message' window and each one only had the 'to' email address filled in, nothing else. \nThis is an old iPhone 4s, running iOS 8 - not my main phone, keeping it for nostalgia more than anything. \nThis could have been several years of me accidentally tapping on peoples email addresses, and the app automatically opens this - and me never cancelling those, they just built up. However I don't recognise any of those email addresses and they were personal email addresses I don't recognise.\nI've checked my iCloud account and the linked hotmail/outlook account from my laptop and it doesn't look like any emails were sent or received from the account, other than my own emails (which were only about 4 or 5 in total) - so no suspicious activities there.\nSo either a bunch of emails and the 'to' field was started and filled in and nothing else happened or the traces of sent emails were somehow deleted - which I don't know if that's possible. \nCould this be a virus/malware? Is this a known issue/ bug? \nEDIT: I've also check the iCloud/apple ID and when I sign in, I get a permission request on my mac and a code is displayed which I have to enter to log in - so if anyone had entered my account, I would have know from my mac. Right?\n\nA: Tons of mails in a draft state is how things worked before IMAP and mail sync on iOS got better at handling this. Especially with gmail, this was a routine thing - dozens of drafts saved (littered) along the way.\nI think you are fine if you know you have a secure password, aren’t seeing actual mails sent and can delete the mails. Extra bonus on the multi factor / alert, but older iOS devices might be grandfathered in as trusted, so perhaps change that in iCloud if you want a little extra resistance from this device without wiping it or signing out.\nIf you’re paranoid, erase all content and settings on the device, but just the presence of 40 to 100 drafts seems harmless in my experience. Without some other indicator you lost control of the device or the account credentials, I’d just keep it in mind and watch things.\n", "Q: Why do I have to unlock an iPad to charge it? When I plug in the \"iPad (6th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular\" to the MacBook, it always says \"unlock this iPad to use accessories.\"  What it doesn't say is that it also won't charge until I do so.  Took me several times to figure this out.  (Has a cover, so I didn't see the message.)\nBut the iPhone 7+ doesn't do that.  Both have IOS 12.4, so there must be a setting that I am not recognizing.  Or are there distinct unlabeled \"flavors\" of IOS?\nHow can I make it start charging as soon as plugged in, even if screen is locked?\n\nA: The 'unlock to charge' is a new security feature since iOS 11.4. If you charge from a device that asks to communicate over USB you have to opt in. \nAlternatively, just plug in to a 'dumb' charger or employ a USB data block dongle / condom to physically prevent “juice jacking”. If there's no potential data connection, there's no restriction on charging or prompt to unlock.\nTo elaborate a bit, this design prevents hardware USB devices read data from your device. Remember when the FBI wanted to get into some guy's phone & tried to force Apple through the courts to 'let them in'? This is the current state of play in the hacker 'war'.\nIt can be disabled if you don't think you have any data on there worthy of government or black hat hacker intrusion.\nApple KB - Using USB accessories with iOS 11.4.1 and later\nSettings > Face [Touch] ID & Passcode > USB Accessories \n", "Q: How to return to setup for a new mac?

The output was good, it sets the nvram to install the update after the reboot but nothing.\nWhat should I do? Change the logic-board seems expensive and stupid if the problem is just a upgrade.\nThanks everyone. \n\nA: Your question does miss some key details, so this answer makes the following assumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've correctly identified your current Boot ROM version\n\n*Your MBP still has the original Apple SSD installed\n\n*You've already tried (directly or indirectly) resetting the NVRAM\n\n*You've never installed macOS High Sierra on your MacBook Pro\n\n\nEssentially, some years back Apple started automatically including firmware updates (if/when required) within macOS updates/upgrades. And, with the move to the APFS file system, firmware updates were required on pre-existing Macs with SSD drives to support macOS High Sierra (and above) as they required APFS to be installed. So, cutting a long story short, you're most likely missing this firmware update. \nSince you've already gone through quite a bit of frustration, your best bet is to go through a total reinstall process. My recommendation would be to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a full backup of your data using Time Machine (or your preferred backup solution)\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Switch on your MBP and immediately press and hold the OptionCommand ⌘R keys *\n\n*Let go of the keys once you see either the Apple logo, a spinning globe or a firmware password prompt \n\n*When the macOS Utilities window appears select the Disk Utility option\n\n*Proceed to erase your internal drive\n\n*Quit Disk Utility\n\n*The macOS Utilities window should reappear\n\n*Now select the Reinstall macOS option\n\n*Proceed to install macOS\n\n*Once the installation is complete, migrate your data across\n\n\n* This specific key combination will install the latest version of macOS compatible with your model Mac, which presently is macOS Mojave. \n\nA: You left out one important part - when an OS install sees it needs to update firmware, it can only be done from the internal drive during the full installation process ... and on your model, it has to be an Apple SSD-stick.\n", "Q: How to report a deceptive in app purchase Hoe do you go about reporting a deceptive in app purchase to apple? For example if an app has a purchase that claims to remove ads but it does not remove them as described.\nWhat I mean is the app has 3 types of ads. one is a forced ad that shows from time to time. Another is an ad that is required in order to progress in the game, for example in order to unlock the next item that can be purchased. And the final is an ad that can be watched for a reward.\nI am currently on a device with ios 13 beta so I am unable leave a review and there appears to be no way to report a problem with the app from the app store on the device\n\nA: When you open the App Store, near the top on the right is a link to support. This takes you to iTunes support where you can search or submit a question.  I searched on your question and found the following:\n\nContact the iTunes Store Customer Service department using the form on\n  their   Support page (select the category and subcategory closest to\n  the issue you're reporting and you'll find either an \"Express Lane\"\n  button - just follow the instructions to get to the contact form - or\n  an \"Email Us\" button) and explain your situation to them.\n\n\nA: Apple app store support for third-party apps (not officially designed by Apple) is virtually nonexistent.\nThe only thing I ever found on reporting scams in the App Store is their \"Report A Problem\" link (https://reportaproblem.apple.com) which allows you to report bad purchases or scams within 90 days of the original charge.\nOther than that, there is no fraud-protection, refunds, or third-party app support. Apple's website makes it virtually impossible to report anything out of purchases in the 90-day context. There's no link for reporting App Store rule violations. Caveat emptor - let the buyer beware. Assume that any microtransaction in an app can and will scam you, and don't assume Apple will help you out because they don't in my experience. (That's also the reason why I largely stopped buying apps on the App Store in protest of their horrendously bad and limited options for reporting problems.)\n", "Q: Why Does My Apple Watch Lose Connection to My iPhone When Using a VPN I am using an Always On VPN on my iPhone 6s that I setup using Algo. The VPN is hosted on Digital Ocean. I add the VPN by installing a configuration profile on a supervised device.\nWhenever I install the VPN configuration profile on my iPhone, my Apple Watch (Series 4) says it is still connected through Bluetooth, but all data transfer between phone and watch is halted. If I go to Settings -> General -> Usage on the iPhone Watch app for example, I get an error message about being unable to connect to the watch. I have played with all the VPN settings here, but they seem to not fix anything https://developer.apple.com/business/documentation/Configuration-Profile-Reference.pdf.\nHave VPNs on an iPhone been known to break watch connectivity? My understanding is that Bluetooth never falls under the VPN realm. Thanks!\nEdit: As an additional bit of information. When attempting to re-sync anew or from a backup of the Apple watch, syncing hits an error mid-through and reverts to unpaired again. This is also because of the VPN as I do not have issues with pairing when there is no VPN on the iPhone.\n\nA: I have come to the conclusion that a VPN simply causes a lot of connection issues when dealing with iOS and watchOS. For example, I found that iMessage and standard texts were not working correctly on my iPhone when my VPN was on. This is all besides the Apple Watch connection issues.\nMy answer is a non-answer in that VPNs and iOS/WatchOS do not play well together. I wish I could point you towards some documentation on why, but I cannot find any.\n", "Q: iPhone 'My Number' is missing in the settings app - can I get it reinstated? My number tab is not showing any number and it's blank. I am unable to tap on it to input the number myself. Hence, iMessage and Facetime can not be accessed using my phone number. \nHow can I get my iPhone to re-read my SIM card or cellular service so that it shows in the settings app and I can try again to set up messaging using my proper cellular number to combine with my AppleID/iCloud account?\n\nA: I can’t reproduce this, but here is how I would troubleshoot it and why:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the device in AirPlane mode and then power off.\n\n*Start up and then go to settings (still in AirPlane mode) and look at the cellular data information / carrier information / phone information. Perhaps record/screen shot the MEID/IMEI and SIM information.\n\n*Open and re-seat your SIM card while in AirPlane mode still.\n\n*Connect to WiFi and check for updates, update the iOS to the latest and then disable AirPlane mode.\n\n*Power down and back up one more time while cellular and WiFi are enabled.\n\n*In the settings app - reset network settings - this should restart one last time.\n\n\nAt this point, you can be sure the SIM isn’t trivially failing and the iOS had a chance to talk to the cellular carriers. At this point, I would back up the device and then erase all content and settings. Now make a tea or coffee and get ready to call/engage tech support for your cellular carrier and explain you’re needing help knowing why your device isn’t working with their service. They can’t really say there’s a bug with iOS or your apps if you’re willing to repeat the reset network settings / power cycle / erase all content and settings. They might say - check with Apple and Apple would say, restore the device and if it still doesn’t work go back to the carrier. \nAt that point, the carrier is really on the hook for providing you a reason why your service isn’t working. Similarly, Apple support will be a breeze to erase / restore / rule out trivial failures and fix this in almost all cases without waiting hours on either call.\n"]
