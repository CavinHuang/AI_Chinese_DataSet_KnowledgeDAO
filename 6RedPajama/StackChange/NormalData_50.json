["Q: Script to automatically make a new bookmark folder in Skim for each PDF and store every bookmark created in it's respective folder? Skim by default makes every new bookmark in the bookmark menu for all the pdf's,  even if I create a bookmark folder for the pdf manually, there is no way of making it save the bookmark in this folder automatically because in the save bookmark dialogue by default the Add To field will show Bookmarks Menu as the default location, which I have to manually change to the folder I created each time. So I was wondering if there is a applescript method of automating all this so, a bookmark folder will be automatically created when I save the first bookmark and every consequent bookmark will be automatically saved into this folder.\n\nA: Apparently Skim has a nice Wiki, which covers much, including Wiki: AppleScript and has quite a few scripts available.

I downloaded from Internet (topcoder.com) a Java applet. When I try to open it, it says \"Application blocked for security reasons\" because \"The certificate has expired\".\n\nI really want to launch it... So, is there a way to open and use it?\nI tried to go to the Java settings and add the link to the applet to the white list, but it does not work.\n\nA: Just to be clear, the reason you are getting this error isn't because of a problem with Java on your Mac. The problem is with a certificate that has been used to sign one or more of the JAR files that make up the TopCoder Java application.\nThe certificate expired on March 25th this year.\n\nIf you still want to run the application, even though the certificate has expired, then you need to add it to the Exception Site List within Java Control Panel.\nYou may want to update Java on your Mac first though. You can get the latest download from Oracle here, Apple don't supply their own Java runtime anymore.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Java Control Panel from System Preferences\n\n*Select the Security tab\n\n*Click on \"Edit Site List...\"\n\n*Click on \"Add\"\n\n*Enter \"http://www.topcoder.com\" in the Location field\n\n*Click OK\n\n*Click Apply\n\n\nNow when you try to open the JNLP file you'll get a different message. Just check the \"I accept the risk and want to run this application\" and click Run.\n\nAt which point the application should successfully download and run.\n\n", "Q: Replaced the cable. Now the screen doesn't work. What could it be? The cable that comes out of the back of my Apple Thunderbolt Display was fraying. I decided that rather than risk a short at some point, I'd preemptively replace the cable. Upon iFixit teardown photos, I decided to replace the cable that comes out of the back of the screen myself instead of paying nearly $200 to get an Apple Service Provider to do it here in Bangkok. Bought the cable on AliExpress for $12. Replaced it. And ... no dice. Screen did not come on. \nMy setup\n[MacBook Air] ---- [Thunderbolt Display] --- [Thunderbolt drive] --- [Cinema Display]\n\nwith a USB drive and Ethernet plugged into the back of the Thunderbolt Display\nAlready tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Initial thoughts were that the cable was faulty. But then I noticed\nEthernet came on, the USB drive was mounted, Thunderbolt drive was\nmounted and after a reboot the Cinema Display also come on.\nObviously, the cable was working just fine.\n\n*Second thought was that I had neglected to reconnect some cables that connect the LCD panel to the main logic board. I checked. Seemed just fine.  \n\n*Third was that\nperhaps the cable serial number was somehow tied to the main logic\nboard. So I put the old cable back. Still no screen.  \n\n*Tried to\nconnect the screen using an external Thunderbolt cable, everything\nworked equally well but still no image on the screen.\n\n*Tried 30+\nseconds and 3+ hours unplugged as a 'reset' of the screen. No change.\n\n*Rebooted my laptop. No change.\n\n*Plugged the Thunderbolt Display into\nthe drive and then into the MacBook, so change the sequence of\ndevices. No change.\n\n*System Information reports under \"Thunderbolt\"\nthe whole chain of devices, but under \"Graphics/Displays\" shows only\nthe internal screen and Cinema Display.  \n\n*Using the newly-purchased\ncable as an external Thunderbolt cable works just fine too.\n\n\nQuestion\nDoes anybody have any suggestions on what to try next?\nDoes the logic board go into some kind of lockdown mode when replacing the cable?\nAre there more than 3 connecting flat cables + ground connection between the panel and the main logic board?\nAlthough there is no reason to assume it has been, how do I test the LCD panel to still function given all these flat cable connectors?\nNote: There are no Apple Stores here.  Apple Authorised Service providers are no help. They suggested replacing the cable and the panel at a cost that is nearly the same as buying a new screen.\n\nA: If all of your devices in the Thunderbolt \"chain\" are still functional including your Cinema display at the end of it all, chances are there is a problem with the connectors that go from the logic board in the Thunderbolt display to the display panel itself.\nIt's a quite common occurrence that when you disassemble this, that the connector comes loose.  Look to make sure that the LVDS and power connectors are securely attached at both the logic board side and on the display panel itself.\n", "Q: Can't download any app from AppStore! I'm using iPhone 6s 16 GB. My storage isn't full but still I can't download anything. Every time I wanted to start a download it keeps telling:\napp name* could not be download at this time\n\n\nA: *\n\n*First I'd suggest you to try perhaps thru an alternate internet connection.\n\n*If that doesn't resolve the issue I'd suggest you the following since you're stating that this happens every time you try to download an app or an update then I assume that this happens by every app and resetting your iPhone doesn't either work then I'd suggest you to try signing out of the App Store then restart your iPhone and sign into the App Store and try again to download.\n\n\nSee my answer in this post\n\nA: Usually this fixes itself server side in a day or three, but a way to triage this and ensure the device itself isn’t a problem is as follows. \n\n\n*\n\n*Put the phone in airplane mode\n\n*Power down the device with no network (stay in airplane mode)\n\n*Open settings and record (paper or screenshot) how much free space is available after the restart (stay in airplane mode)\n\n*Pick an app you can delete, delete it, repeat the space measurement. \n\n\nAt that point you should know you have free space, the delete works and more space is returned. \nThen power down the device a second time. When it restarts, confirm space is correct and then re-enable the networking. \nAt that point, you would either wait out the update error, find a new network entirely to check if the network were blocking updates, try restoring the device entirely after making a backup and/or ask Apple Store support to check your account. \n", "Q: VIP emails being deleted I have searched online but not found the answer to this problem.\nFor some reason, the emails in VIP folders only remain in the folder for 2 weeks and then they are gone. The oldest emails in the VIP folders are from June 16.\nIs there a setting in Mac Mail for when these emails in the VIP folders are deleted?\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nA: Go to Preferences > Rules. See if any rule is deleting VIP messages.\nIf any rules rules are deleting VIP messages, Just delete Them.\n\n\nA: I too, lost my VIP folder, did some research and found a solution that worked.\nLocate an email (any email) from someone you'd like to mark as VIP in Apple Mail.  Hover over that person's name in the from field — it doesn't actually say \"from\" but it should be obvious what I'm referring to — the name above the \"to\" field.  A gray outline of a star should appear ... click this star and your VIP folder should reappear below your Inbox(es) and above your \"flagged\" and \"sent\" folders in the left margin of your viewer window.  Hope this helps.\n\nA: It is possible that you set up a \"rule\" in your Mail.app that automatically deletes VIP emails. Inside the mail app, hit Command+, to open Preferences then go to the Rules tab, and press the \"Edit\" button with each created rule selected.\nHere's an example rule you might have created (accidentally or purposefully) that could auto-delete VIP emails:\n\nBe sure to delete any such rules, then see if your problem goes away.\n", "Q: change proxy settings for Chrome and not for entire operating system How can I change proxy settings for Google Chrome without changing the proxy settings for entire operating system? I know that I can go to Network in System preferences, but that changes proxy settings globally. \nIs is possible to do it just for Chrome? Firefox for example doesn't require changing global proxy settings.\nEDIT: I am open for dirty hacks too :D\n\nA: You have to pass the proxy argument to Chrome on the command line. Run something like:\nopen -a \"Google Chrome\" --args --proxy-server=http://my-proxy.com\n\n\nA: You can set proxies per-profile using the extension Proxy SwitchyOmega.

After outputting my MacBook Pro sound to the device through USB for a few minutes there appears noise and not long later it becomes so unbearable that I have to pause the media. That cycles every 3-5 minutes provided that I output it through USB. If I output through the 3.5mm jack, however, everything is smooth. I tried using the device on a Windows computer and outputting through USB worked fine. I also recorded the outputted audio(screenFlow) and there was no noise there.\n\nA: Sounds like a problem with the audio format. Open the Audio MIDI Setup application, select your USB device, and try different combinations for audio format (sampling rate, channel/bit-depth).\n\nIf your device is locked at a sample rate and/or bit-depth, this should be a workaround. Try creating a Multi-Output Device with your device and the Built-in Output. (note: with the multi-output, you will have to set the volume on each device individually)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the + icon at the bottom left and select Create Multi-Output Device.\n\n*Under the \"use\" column, select Built-in Output and your device.\n\n*Set the Master Device to Built-in Output. This will allow you to choose different sample rates based on what is allowed for Built-in Output.\n\n*Lower the volume on Built-in Output (essentially muting it so sound only goes through your device)\n\n*Right-click on your device under the Multi-Output Device and check Resample this subdevice.\n\n*In System Preferences > Sound, change the output device to the Multi-Output Device.\n\n\nNow you can change the sample rate of the multi-output device.\n", "Q: Superuser su password reset I am using OSX 10.6\nI am the admin of my computer, however when I try to login as the super user through my terminal using my admin password, I am denied. Is there anyway to reset the password or find out what my password is?\n\nA: OS X doesn't set a root password by default, so it's not possible to log in or su to root. The preferred way to run commands as root is sudo, since that requires your admin password instead of the (nonexistent) root password.\nsudo works a little different from su, as it's really intended to run single commands as root. Generally, you just use sudo as a prefix on whatever command you want to run as root (e.g. sudo cp -R myApplication.app /Applications). If you want a root shell (as su does by default), use sudo -s.\nI don't recommend setting a root password, but if you do need to do it, you can either run sudo passwd or run Directory Utility.app (which is hidden in /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications), clicking the padlock and authenticating as an admin, then choosing Edit menu > Enable Root User. \n\nA: I assume you want to recover the root password. You can reset the password by logging in using your normal administrator account, opening the Terminal and issuing the command sudo passwd.\n", "Q: No animation with MissionControl? Why? I don't have animation for Mission Control anymore. It seems that it has been like that for few days. I have updated Duet a few days ago, maybe that's related...\nWhat happened? Is it possible that someone disable it? Or, is it a bug or the sign that the hardware is damaged?\nOS: 10.11.5\nHardware: MacBook Pro (2,3 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 Go, Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 Mo)\n\nEdit\nI've tried to do in the terminal\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25\n\nthen press enter\nkillall Dock\n\nthen press enter\nIt works. But when I restart the computer, it does not work anymore.\n\nI've tried installing Duet (third party software which I suspected to be responsible). It did not change anything.\nEdit 2\nI've tried uninstalling Duet (third party software which I suspected to be responsible). It did not change anything.\n\nA: I too, have Duet installed and lost Mission Control animations on last update.\nI believe it's some lazy \"bug fixing\" on Duet's team: Duet was running and I got logged out of my Mac\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration\n\nthen run Duet and then\ndefaults read com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration\n\nIt's again gets set to zero.\nSo my solution so far is deleting expose-animation-duration setting and removing Duet from autostart for a time being.\n\nA: If the Terminal commands mentioned above give you the animation back, you could try putting them in a script file and having it run as a login item.\nFirst, open Script Editor. Hit ⌘N to make a new document window, and in that window paste the following AppleScript script:\ndo shell script ¬\n\"defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.00\" & ¬\n\"defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25\" ¬\n& return & ¬\n\"killall Dock\"\n\nNext, click File > Export. At the bottom of the save dialogue, choose Application as the file type. It doesn't really matter where you save it to, as long as you will know where it is later.\nNext, go to System Preferences > Users & Groups. Click on your user account, and go to the Login Items tab. Click the plus button at the bottom of the list, navigate to your new application and click the Add button. Now, whenever you log out and back in or restart your computer, this script will be run, (hopefully) fixing your Mission Control animations.\nAs to exactly why this might be happening, I honestly have no clue. Never had this issue before.\n\nA: You can try making the commands that made it work run at startup. So just open TextEdit, type\n#!/bin/bash\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25\nkillall Dock\n\nThen save it as whatever (just make sure it either has no extension or that the extension is .sh or .command), open System Preferences, go to Users & Groups > Login Items, and add it to there.\n\nA: Try resetting your dock back to it's original configuration. This will involve deleting the com.apple.dock.plist file so that when the Dock is reloaded it will create a new dock as if this is the first time you are logging in.  This means you will have to redo all your customizations\nGo to ~/Library/Preferences and execute the command:\nmv com.apple.dock.plist ~/.Trash; killall Dock\n\nThat will bring your Dock back to the state when you first created your account so you will have to re-customize. I opted to move the files to trash, so that if you want to go back, you can restore from Trash and everything will be the way it was before you started.\nHowever, if you just want to delete the file permanently, you could also issue the command (there's no going back with this one):\nrm com.apple.dock.plist; killall Dock\n\nReboot, and all should be working again.\n\nA: Remove Duet from your login items, then type defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.25;killall Dock.\nIt is a bug in Duet. Do not use it for a while.\n", "Q: Have two Macbook Pros, can't update iMovie on either I have an old MacBook Pro running iMovie 9.0, and a newer Macbook Pro with version 10.1.1. I am trying to get them to match. \nWhen I try to update the old one to use it for my movies by going to the App Store, there is no update listed in current updates.  When I select iMovie as if I'm going to buy it it says \"update\" in the box, but the asterisk-like wheel just circles forever. I have tried trashing the application, signing out and back in as suggested, but nothing changes.\n\nA: Mac Apps have limitations as to which operating systems they can be installed on. You mentioned a newer MacBook Pro on 10.1.1 (did you mean 10.11? If not, keep reading). You need to first update your operating system, and then update iMovie. If you are unable to update the computer because it is too old and the new OS doesn't support it, you can get your copy of iMovie from Purchases in the Mac App Store, but it might not be updated.

Now it keeps repeating endlessly. The only buttons I can find are play, stop, restart and skip ahead. There is no \"repeat\" button!\nHow do I make it stop repeating the playlist?\n\nA: There is a repeat button in Apple Music. It is shown in this image: http://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Repeat-icon.jpg\nAll you need to do is deselect that option. Don't be misled by the small '1' that shows up on the icon- you need to deselect it entirely.\nIf you don't have a button, please provide a screenshot so I can give different advice, but you should have it... It's easy to miss though\n", "Q: Can't type ' / ' (slash) after the letter ' l ' (ell) in Terminal, makes 'l' with stroke character 'ł' When I type any word ending with an 'l' (ell, like \"local\") and then press the / key, the 'l' is replaced with another symbol and the slash, '/', is omitted. How can I deactivate that function?\n\n\nA: This looks like the behavior of some very old Mac fonts (Palatino was one of them) where you could make the character l with stroke (used in Polish and elsewhere) by typing such a sequence.  Try changing your font.  If this is in fact the cause of the problem,  you should get rid of the font that does this, which should not be on any modern mac.\n\nA: Seeing that you use white on black, I take it you use the \"Pro\" profile (unless you duplicated it or created a fresh new one).\nI would look into Terminal's preferences and check the used encoding and other options.  If there are differences with, let's say the \"Basic\" profile, try to see if using that profile is behaving the same or behaves as you would expect.  If it is as you expect it, see about changing your used profile more and more to the comparison.\n\nA: I had this same problem because I had an old Monaco font in ~/Library/Fonts/. I was able to disable the old font with FontBook, and the issue was resolved.\nNote that I had the same issue with a number of leftover old fonts. I was able to clean them all out in FontBook with \"Look for enabled duplicates...\"\n\nA: This looks to me like a rendering bug rather than a feature. I would try increasing the font size on your terminal.\n", "Q: Charge iPad Pro 12.9 on an USB 3 port? I just read through Fast Charging iPad Pro 12.9 and am intrigued.\nHowever I'd like to use the USB 3 port on my MacBook air instead of buying a new power brick just for the iPad Pro.\nHas anybody tried to use an USB 3 -> USB C adaptor in conjunction with Apples USB C to Lightning cable?\nI haven't found an USB 3 to USB C adaptor only USB C to USB 3. Maybe that answers my question already.\n\nA: I guess that's the answer. \nWikipedia:\nAdapters and cables with a Type-C receptacle are not allowed.(41)\n\nA: USB3 is able to deliver 0.9A while USB2 is able to deliver 0.5A, so yes, it can charge some power hungry devices quicker. Since the power difference is in the adaptor (which is why big iPad bricks charge iPads quicker than little iPhone bricks), I am doubtful that getting a USB3->USBC adaptor will make a difference. The power is in the adaptor (brick).\n", "Q: Unable to install iOS 9.3 beta Profile After installing iOS beta 10 and then downgrading again to 9.3 standard with clean install, it seems that I can't install the profile for iOS 9.3 Public Beta via apple beta program.\nAfter touching on the link with iPhone 6S Plus, the phone returns an error.\nNo profiles is installed at the moment.\nAny advice? Thanks\n\nA: Apple warns against switching profiles for this reason.\nYou could try to remove any lingering profiles that could be getting in the way by connecting your phone to a Mac (if you have one). Then in Xcode (you might have to install), go to Windows > Devices. From there, you can manage the installed profiles and delete any that might be causing a conflict.\nAlso, be sure you are doing everything correctly. This guide should be of help: http://www.imore.com/how-download-ios-93-public-beta\n\nA: I had the same problem. It's because their profile is expired.

I know that on a Windows PC I can set my desktop background to be a slideshow of images that changes periodically. Is this possible on an iPhone in any way? If so, how can I do it?\n\nA: Short answer, no. iOS built-in feature set doesn't support a background slideshow.\nApp Store apps can't automatically change the wallpaper on a device, so you won't find a third-party app to do this for you.\n\nA: If you really want this feature buy and Android.

Or, are they gone forever?\n\nA: First, I would check the trash from within iPhoto to see if you can simply undelete the photos.\nIf that doesn't work, hopefully you have your Time Machine backup available. Go to your Photos folder in Finder, then from the Time Machine icon on your Menu Bar, select Enter Time Machine... Once active, you'll be able to find a recent copy of your iPhoto.Library package and restore it.\nGood practices would also suggest that you move your existing iPhoto.Library to a safe location before you do the above  so that it is not overwritten until after you've verified the restore.\n", "Q: Toggle `fn` key via keyboard shortcut Has anyone figured out a way to toggle the function keys on and off via key board shortcut on a macbook?

Risks with beta software...\n", "Q: Export from Photo into Folders labeled by date shot First, just to get this off my chest, I used to have such a beautiful, simple, efficient system of cataloging my photos by date shot, whether from my professional Canon cameras or my iPhone. I did it all out of Lightroom. Then came the time when I could no longer import iPhone into Lightroom and this messed it all up. Then came the time when I could not import even into Photo and this created a nightmare that, if everything works as designed from here forward will take me months, if not years, if ever, to straighten out and at a tremendous loss of time. But Apple has trapped me and I am trying.\nMy last iPhone upgrade allowed me to finally be able to import from my phone into Photo (I always keep my phone updated) . This still requires a couple of extra, previously unnecessary, steps to go from there to put into folders I can catalog by day right along with my Canon shoots in Lightroom. When I export, the photos show up in folders with the name of the area where they were shot and there can be several such folders from one single day.\nThis just adds to the nightmare. Is there any way I can set it to export out of photo directly into folders labeled by date with no interference from folders labeled by location? \n\nA: If I understand your problem correctly, have you tried importing the images from your phone using Image Capture rather than Photo?  You can then put them into whatever folder you like.\n", "Q: How does my phone tell me my elevation even though I'm nowhere near a cell tower? I have the compass app (Comes with the phone) on my iPhone 6 and it can still tell me my elevation even though I have no service, why is this? Is there a magnet or something similar in the phone?\nIt updates when I touch the screen so I know it's connecting to something somehow.\nAlso, roaming is off and I am nowhere near a cell tower when that was taken. \n\nA: This is determined by satellites in the horizon mapping out where your phone is (according to multiple posts on Stack Overflow, including https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13329714/how-does-my-iphone-get-its-altitude). Note that the accuracy from this method is not usually precise, but it is a rough estimate of your elevation.\n\nA: It is using GPS signal, from satellites, and possibly air pressure (on iphone 6 and later I believe) for altitude. \nAnd for direction it has a compass, i.e. a sensor which measures the earth's magnetic field. \n", "Q: Chinese input crashes programs The problem is that when I type in Chinese, the program crashes.

I'm looking to make it easier to read my browser by changing the color of the background and text, however there is no option to do so that I can find in the settings panel.  Is this something I can change? Or would this require knowledge of coding?\n\nA: You can invert colors from System Preferences -> Accessibility. As mentioned in your comments, a webpage's background is in control of the developer/webmaster.\n\nA: If you are moderately versed in CSS, you can use the Safari extension Quickstyle to select any page element and modify any of it's CSS attributes.\nOnce installed, click on the toolbar icon, hover over different elements on the page (they will be highlighted), and then click on the element you want to modify. A pop-up CSS editor will come up and you can edit to your hearts content. All changes are persistent, but non-permanent and you can edit or delete them as desired.\nNote, I think the changes are stored in a cookie and will be wiped out if you clear cookies on Safari.\nChanges can be made to the whole page or to specific elements site-wide.\nI use it to increase the fonts for easier reading on a variety of sites, as well as to remove distracting elements.\n", "Q: Cannot edit the \"Release Date\" field for TV shows in iTunes For some reason I cannot edit the \"Release Date\" field in iTunes. I have been able to change it in the past, but it no longer saves changes.\n\nI can edit the field, but changes are never saved. I'm running the latest version of iTunes on Windows (12.4.1.6). I have completely rebuilt my entire iTunes library but still the problem persists.\n\nA: You can \"import\" a TV show episode from the Windows system to your Mac, set the release date on the Mac and then copy it back to the Windows system. Not exactly a viable workaround for most but if you happen to have both platforms it may work until Apple gets their act together and starts to test their software before releasing it to their customers.\nQuoted from Apple's Support Forums: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7567758?start=0&tstart=0\nSeems like this is an issue for many and you might have to wait for a newer version.\n\nA: I have mapped the directories with a windows 7 machine and am able to edit the dates this looks to be an issues with Windows 10.

In (insert any other OS here), many context menus items have hot keys for fast access (which are shown by underlining the appropriate character).\nIs there a way to get this working on Mac? There do seem to be keys that jump to certain items, but I can't figure out what they are.\nNote that I don't want to set up millions of shortcuts because\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications have standard menu navigations across platforms\n\n*There's hundreds of items that I use in different contexts\n\n\nA: It seems that the \"equivalent\" functionality is based on the starting characters and lots of typing as explained in Navigating to options in context menus's answers - in that question you can see that some menu items would be diabolically hard to select, involving typing whole words to disambiguate 2 items.\nIt seems that the application can specify priority, since the item selected isn't necessarily the first one that starts with what is being typed.\n", "Q: Mid-2014 Macbook Pro i7 15\" OS 10.6.8 boot fails I pulled my hard drive from a kaput i7 Macbook Pro because it had Snow Leopard (10.6.8) with Rosetta Stone. I need to run older G5 software. I put the drive in an external case, and hooked it up via USB to the newer Macbook Pro. I see the old drive on the screen when I boot normally under 10.11.5. However, when I boot up with the option key down, I get to select the 10.6.8 drive - but all I subsequently get is a gray screen with a small apple symbol. What is the problem please? \n\nA: With few exceptions, a Mac must run the OS X version that it shipped with as a minimum version.  The minimum OS for your Mid-2014 MacBook Pro is at least 10.9.4, so you won't be able to run Snow Leopard on it.\n", "Q: Very slow file copy to encrypted disk image I have a new iMac running El Capitan.  Bought a SanDisk flash drive for backup.  I created an encrypted disk image on the flash drive.\nHere's the problem:  copying 10GB to the unencrypted part of the flash drive takes about 5-6 minutes.  Copying the same 10GB to the encrypted disk image is estimated to take 2 hours.\nWhy the huge difference in copy times?  Is there any way to speed up file copying to an encrypted disk image?\n\nA: Finder needs to encrypt each file before copying it to the disk. \nNo, there is not a way to speed it up without removing drive encryption.\n", "Q: Can I use two Airport Express routers to extend an Airport Extreme network? I have an airport extreme as my main WIFI router and I have an Airport Express downstairs which is set to extend the network and it works flawlessly. I recently also got a second Airport Express to extend the Airport Extreme network at my top floor and it always tells me it cannot join the network with the exact same settings as the other Airport Express. At the location where the upstairs Airport Express is set up, the network signal strength is good.\nMy question is: Is it even possible to extend an Airport Extreme network twice with two different Airport Express routers, or is this not supported?\nThe error I get is the following. \n\nA: I recently was able to do this successfully, adding a 2nd Airport Express with a wifi-only connection to an existing network which had RS232 lines to a modern Airport Extreme and an Airport Express. I'm using the latest Mac OS. What I found most effective after plugging the new unit it was to restart the Mac (Mac Mini circa 2012) several times so that it would, eventually, recognize the new Express hardware. I did set the TCP/IP Configure IPv6 to link-local only but I do not know if that made any difference. Once everything was working I changed back to Configure iPv6 automatically. \n", "Q: Right-click a html file and print it? I've went ahead and created the Automator workflow that let's me have a \"print this file\" right-click menu in Finder.\nIt works fine for pdf and txt files, but if I try the same on a html file, the printer spits out a blank page. Obviously the file needs to be rendered by a browser first, then printed, but is there a way to do this?\nIt's not an option for me to convert this to pdf, the contents of the document are randomized with javascript. I would want to preserve this, I do not want identical content to print every time.\nIf this could be added to the same right-click menu item, that would be good. If it has to open Safari in the background or something like that, that's not a dealbreaker, though I'd like for it to close itself after printing.\nChrome is the default browser (and almost always open) if that matters.\n\nA: This is pretty easy to do through automator and the \"Watch me do\" actions. Here's what I got to work however you'd likely replace your input with however you're getting the file in your setup\n\nDisplay Webpages opens the HTML file in the default browser (in this case chrome) and then we enter Command-P and then Enter which brings up the print dialog and then prints with the default settings because the print button is the initial highlighted button. This will work with whatever fancy javascript you've got and you can optionally add a wait period between launching the file and sending the print keys to allow it to fully render/load.\n", "Q: Estimated copy time? Copying Finder folders of JPEGs from new iMac 10.11.5 to new SanDisk 256GB flash drive, USB 3.0.\n129 GB is taking three hours. Seems slow to me, does this sound right? \n\nA: It really depends on the write speed of your flash drive. But it does sound right since (like Sirens pointed out) it's many small files and not one big one. \n", "Q: Can I calibrate 2 screens to match, without buying expensive gear? I use a 2010 Cinema Display and a 2011 Thunderbolt Display, both connected to my 11-inch MacBook Air. The screens are ever so slightly different in terms of how things are reproduced. \nHow can I get both screens to render things the same? \nI know I could buy expensive color calibration hardware, but its really not worth it to me for a one-time use. Instead, is there any other way I can do this? I have a pretty good eye for colours (which I guess is why it bothers me in the first place?) and so perhaps there is some kind of tool that lets me do this by eyeballing it?\n\nA: Personally, I'd go with the expensive option - you have a grand's-worth of screens there; why not have them both accurately profiled?\nThe first downside of manual calibration is not knowing which of the two is 'more correct' in the first place - the second is actually getting them both to look the same...\nBack in the good old bad old CRT days I always used to set screens up by eye - since I bought a colorimeter, I haven't looked back.\nIf you do decide to go for a colorimeter, avoid the entry-level Huey Pro, as it no longer works on Mac. Bottom of the line these days is probably the Color Munki Smile, which is quite adequate for 'in-house' calibration, if you don't need a fully-calibrated workflow to printers/publishers etc.\nYou can also do PCs & your iPhone with it, if you want ;-)\n\nAnyway - if you want to try it manually, the functionality is built right into the OS itself...\nSystem Prefs > Displays > Color > Calibrate...

OverWatch is game that is run-able under boot-camp. \nWhile running the game, my MBP 2015 generates lots of fan noise and the keyboard becomes much over-heated. \nwould this over-heating kill my machine at a faster pace than ordinary operation?\nTHX\n\nA: Of course the wear on your machine is higher when operated at higher temperatures. But the MBPs have a carefully designed cooling system that should keep temperatures within safe limits. \nIf the CPU or GPU actually do overheat, they will throttle and you will observe performance decrease. It certainly won't hurt to provide some additional airflow, e.g. by putting the MBP onto a stand like one of these so that air can flow underneath or even using a fan.\n", "Q: how do I retrieve my photos that are stored for the last five years while I was with iPhone now that I'm using Android I was with iPhone for over 5 years and stored all of my photos in iCloud now that I have switched to an Android mobile I have lost access to my iPhone pictures is there any way for me to retrieve my photos from the iCloud so that I can view them on my Android?

I tried two other hard drives on the MacBook and I can hear the disk rotation.\nDo you have an idea what's going on and what I can do?\nEdit: I tried two more hard drives. Here's a summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Seagate ST500LT012 (SATA 3): Not even spinning a second.\n\n*Western Digital WD5000LPVX (SATA 3): Spinning for a minute then stops. Not detected in Disk Utility.\n\n*Seagate ST9750420AS (SATA 2): Spinning, detected.\n\n*Original Drive Hitachi 5K750-500 (SATA 2): Was working before being faulty.\n\n\nIs this SATA 2 / SATA 3 related? \nEdit 2 : Fixed by replacing the \"always faulty on the Mid-2012 MacBook\" SATA cable.\n\nA: Surely not all those hard drives are faulty, so I'd look at the SATA controller or cable. Seems you may already have figured that out though. \n", "Q: Is Apple education pricing only for university, not HS, students? I'm not in university, but I am in high school. \nIs this enough to qualify for the educational discounts that Apple offers?\n\nA: In the past, Apple was very casual about handing out educational discounts. This started to change in 2016 and now as of fall 2017 there is a formal verification process that is outsourced to a verification program that checks hardware purchases as well as discounts to services like iTunes Apple Music service discounts for students.\nThe TL,DR summary of education pricing is:\nApple Education Pricing\n\nAvailable to current and newly accepted college students and their parents, as well as faculty, staff, and homeschool teachers of all grade levels.4\n\nUnless you have been accepted to a college, it is not supposed to be enough.\nThe terms and conditions page states that the following people are eligible\nThere is no longer mention of students at the K12 level - only staff at all education levels.\n\nA: Staff of all grade levels, from kindergarten through post doctoral candidates are now eligible for Education discounts direct from Apple.\nAdditionally, parents, staff and students at the collegiate level qualify for the EDU discount.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu\nApple Education Pricing\n\nAvailable to current and newly accepted college students and their parents, as well as faculty, staff, and homeschool teachers of all grade levels. 4\n\n\nIn the past, the discount was widely available to K-12 and you can see results below to reflect that past discount.\nOn the Apple Store for Eduction, you can find your educational institution so you can shop with your discount.  Using \"New York, NY\" as the city and state and selecting K-12 we see that there used to be an extensive list of schools:\n\n\nA: I worked at the Apple store in CT for almost three years and, while you can easily use the Apple Store for Education without being verified no matter WHO you are, it is not using the discount in an honest manner.  If you go to the store, unless the specialist does you a favor, probably in return for you giving him/her a good review on the survey that comes with your receipt, which negates the whole purpose of the feedback you give and the intent of the survey.  Apple believes in positive intent; they don't verify on the web site. This was always maddening to us at the retail level because we repeatedly were told and reminded that it is ONLY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS (and teachers/staff of ANY GRADE school or homeschool or school board.  So during this summer's promotion where Apple's offering Wireless Beats on top of the discount, you have a choice.  You can order online whether you're a gas station attendant or a breeder of Springer Spaniels and just lie, or you can do the right thing and only take the discount if you qualify for it according to Apple's guidelines.  \nAs for proof in the store, you can bring an acceptance letter if you're in high school and accepted at a university so you can buy a new computer for college, or you can bring a badge, or show that you have a school email.  What you REALLY must bring, though, is your driver's license or learner's permit.  That's the weird part.  We were told it is in case we are audited.  Apparently it is supposed to be a US program for US students and US university so you have to be able to prove you live here.  \n\nA: Step by Step sure fire method to find out -\n\n\n*\n\n*Pick up phone.\n\n*Dial 1800MYAPPLE (1-800-692-7753)\n\n*Ask to speak to a customer service rep familiar with the program.\n\n*\"Hello, my name is Zac and I am currently a student at X High School located in Y state. Do I qualify for a student discount?\"\n\n*???\n\n*Profit\n\n\nIf you follow my method and are unable to find out and feel comfortable doing so, post your high school name and I will call them to find out for you and report back.\n\nA: Anyone in the US can get Apple's education pricing. Anyone. Select a school during the checkout. There is no verification process. \n\nA: Yes you can. If your a high school student as long as you sign up and get verified for a UNiDAYS account it will give you a deal to get a macbook with beats included.\n", "Q: How to use OS X HTML Mail signature on iOS Mail I am using an HTML signature in my Mail app on OS X for my iCloud mail account. I created this signature following this instruction: http://matt.coneybeare.me/how-to-make-an-html-signature-in-apple-mail-for-el-capitan-os-x-10-dot-11/\nMy question is now, is there a way to sync my signature over iCloud to be able to use it on my iOS device? My signature contains links and images. I would like both to appear in my iOS signature, too.\nDetailed device information:\nI am using a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.11.5 (El Capitan) and an iPhone 5s with iOS 9.3.2.\nThanks in advance \n\nA: There is a fairly easy work-around to this.  It requires that you setup your email signature in your Gmail account online.  You can include an image, which means it gets uploaded to your Google account, with a permanent reference to it.  Once you've setup your signature in Gmail, just send yourself an email from the online account.  Open this email up on your phone.  Now select the content of the email, your signature, and press copy.  Now go to Settings > Mail and add your signature by pasting it into the signature box.  Your image will be included. If you used different font sizes, they will all be the same now, but Bold, Italics, etc. will be kept.  Even links have the URL intact.  When you send a new mail from the phone, you might not see the image in the mail you are composing, but as the URL is present in the underlying HTML code, the receiving party will see your image in your signature.  This method seems to work with iOS 10.2 PB 3.\n\nA: Apple has made it impossible to include an image in a signature since iOS 9.3 which is totally rediculous. To us as a company this had made us which to Samsung mobiles. We simply can not work without professional signatures as email is such an important part of our business. Apple makes everyone go back to the stoneage with this change.\n", "Q: outlook: apply rule to past messages I use outlook as client for an exchange server.\nI created several rules that are local to the mac (as opposed to server side rules), and I want to apply them for past messages.\nI can't find a way. - Even when I create the rule, I don't see any option to apply it to past messages.\nIt would be fine also to be able to move several selected messages to a folder, but when I create a filter it seems also difficult!!! \nIf I select all messages in the filter, upon right click on one of them, the selection goes away (because of the message preview I think)\nIf I select multiple messages in Inbox, right click is working and I could move all of them, but I must perform multiple selection manually...\nIs it that difficult on Outlook 2011 overs 14.3 ?\n\nA: Here are the instructions for Outlook for Mac 2011 and 2016. \nBasically you have to select the folder or messages you want to apply rules to, then on the Message menu, point to Rules, point to Apply, and then click a rule or click Apply All. You can also right-click or use the toolbar to get to the Rules menu.\nThe problem I was having is this only works for client-side rules. From my link: \"Manually applying rules works only for On My Computer rules. You cannot use Outlook for Mac to manually apply server-based rules.\" So if you have a server-side rule (which is the default and is probably what you want), you'll have to duplicate it as a client-side rule to get it applied to existing messages.\n\nA: I just figured this out because I was having such a hard time too! Its easier than you think. Go to your inbox, click on one of your emails then under the Edit menu click Select All. Then in the home group click on apply rule. Yay! (it will take a while if you have a ton of emails -I had over 11,000 so it took a couple mins).\n\nA: Using Outlook for Mac's \"New Outlook\" mode, you can run rules on existing messages. Just go to the Tools...Rules menu, and then click on the \"play\" button next to the rule you want to run. Here's a picture:\n\nNote that it will take a looooong time to run if you have a lot of messages in your mailbox.\n", "Q: Using pinyin with tones to input Chinese characters I'm a Chinese learner and know from my teacher that there is software (for Windows), which lets you strictly input withtype in pinyin with tones. E.g.  hao3 becomes 好. The Mac OS shipped Chinese input does have pinyin input, but no tone selection, hence you input hao to get 好 (no tone mark). I wonder if there is any way for me to use a pinyin input with tones for Mac OS or on my ipad.\n\nA: Making the user input a tone used to be the default in OS X, but not since at least OS X 10.8. Now it continues to guess your characters as you keep typing, and since it's pretty good at guessing, I guess tone selection was deemed an unnecessary step.\nThere may be some way you can fiddle with com.apple.inputmethod.SCIM.plist or com.apple.inputmethod.TCIM.plist to bring the old behavior back, but at least in the preferences menu that option is no longer available.\nOne thing you can do: after typing the \"untoned\" pinyin for a character, cycle through the four tones by hitting Tab (it's Option + Tab in Traditional Chinese). This will limit the list of suggestions to one particular tone at a time (it also displays a diacritical mark over your pinyin as a visual indicator of which tone you're on).\n\nA: I know it’s been a while, but if you’re still interested in this I just made a keyboard that does exactly this for iOS (also for learning purposes). It is in the App Store now.\n\nA: I think QIM may do this, but I have not verified it myself:\nhttp://www.laoshilink.org/laoshilink/QIM.html\n\nA: When inputting the 4 tones on Latin pinyin representations of Chinese characters, I figured that the US - Internationl layout is not sufficient. You need the ABC - Extended keyboard. After that, you can type all the 4 tones like:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option + ` = Downward tone (à)\n\n*Option + e = Upward tone (á)\n\n*Option + v = Circumflex down tone (ǎ)\n\n*Option + a = Straight tone (ā)\n\n\nFollowed by these tones, press the character to which you want to apply the symbol. I hope this helps.\n", "Q: Triple booting a modern Macbook (early 2015) with Bootcamp in EFI mode So I need to have Windows 10, Linux and OSX on my Macbook pro early 2015 along with a shared data partition. There are several articles on the internet that say Boot Camp only works in so called \"hybrid MBR\" mode and may lead to some problems when updating OSX and it's generally hard to set up triple boot + additional partitions.\nHowever, all those articles are old and I've seen some comments on reddit stating that for modern macs Boot Camp actually lets to boot in native EFI mode.\nI'd like to know if it is true. Does it mean that I can make as many partitions as I want (all of them GPT type) and install not only Windows 10, but Ubuntu as well using only Boot Camp and some disk partitioning tool? Is there a modern guide for this?\nThanks!\n\nA: The short answer is yes. Starting with the 2015 Mac models, you can not use the \"hybrid MBR\" mode. You must use GPT partition scheme for all operating systems installed. Installation is fairly straight forward. When installing Ubuntu, I would advise that you create a second EFI partition. This would allow you to use the Startup Manager to select the current and default operating system to boot from.\nThe order of installation would be OS X, Windows and finally Ubuntu. This allows you to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows. After installing Ubuntu, you will need to copy some files from the first EFI partition to the second EFI partition in order for the Startup Manager recognize the Ubuntu operating system.\nTo get Ubuntu to appear in the Startup Manager, you have to manually mount the both EFI partitions and copy the files in the \\EFI\\UBUNTU folder of the first EFI partition to the \\EFI\\BOOT folder of the second EFI partition. Also, the copied grubx64.efi file needs to be renamed to BOOTX64.EFI.\nYou can also use rEFInd as a boot manager. While rEFInd is not required, it does have the advantage of not having to hold down the option key a startup to switch operating systems. Personally, I have it installed in its own EFI partition, but I rarely use it.\n\nA: I managed to achieve this without using bootcamp, I just installed the operating systems from a disk, then was able to chose what OS I wanted to boot into. with the option key held down at start up. \n", "Q: How do I prevent Terminal.app from capturing Cmd/Ctrl/L?

It works when the active window is Finder, or Notes, or Thunderbird, or ... well, most stuff.\nThere are a few applications where it doesn't though, Terminal being the most annoying. Terminal seems to capture it and treat it as ... well, I'm not sure what.

It has been working fine.  But just recently, it has begun not mirroring the screen to the monitor when it is closed.  I am running El Capitan, but have been doing so for awhile.  This issue just started yesterday.  When I open up the MacBook, the monitor turns on and displays the mirrored desktop, then goes dark when I shut the MacBook.

You may be eligible for a the MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program: If you are, they will fix it for free even if you are out of warrantee (I had my mid 2012 repaired under this program.)\nApple has determined that a small percentage of MacBook Pro systems may exhibit distorted video, no video, or unexpected system restarts.

I have an older MacBook Pro (Late 2011) which came with a built-in optical drive. I replaced the built-in SuperDrive with a second hard drive. However, the USB SuperDrive is not compatible with Macs that came with built-in optical drives.\nI tried modifying the /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist file with the mbasd=1 flag as I would have in Yosemite/Mavericks. However, I was presented with an Operation not permitted message, even when I tried this as root. (As it turns out, this is because of the new System Integrity Protection introduced in El Capitan, which supersedes root)\nIs it possible to get a USB SuperDrive working in El Capitan? If so what are the steps?\n\nA: I discovered this is a fast and simple way to enable a USB SuperDrive on El Capitan:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the \"\" (Apple) menu, select \"Restart...\", and then hold \"⌘\" (Command) and \"R\" at the same time until the progress bar appears. [This will boot El Capitan in recovery mode, which may take a little longer than usual.]\n\n*Once booted into the GUI, click on the \"Options\" menu, and select \"Terminal\".\n\n*Type csrutil disable, and then press return. [This will temporarily disable System Integrity Protection, which is only possible in recovery mode. This will allow us to modify the restricted *.plist file.]\n\n*Type plutil -convert xml1 /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist, and then press return.\n\n*Type vi /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist, and then press return.\n\n*Add the mbasd=1 flag to the \"Kernel Flags\" string, and save the file.

When configuring network devices, I find myself frequently toggling between DHCP <==> Static IP configurations on the CLI.  \nThere seem to be plenty of examples of performing this task via the GUI, however, this does not lend itself to frequent toggling between DHCP and a target static IP.\nThe ability to toggle between states from the CLI is convenient.  It may be the pinnacle-of-convenience to invoke a toggle-script to a Safari \\ Firefox button.  \n\nA: A netsh counterpart for manipulating network settings would be the networksetup command, but to achieve what you want, the easiest would be to define two separate network locations in GUI, one with static IP, the other one with DHCP. Then execute:\n# scselect\nDefined sets include: (* == current set)\n   02080D27-B377-4942-BB3A-CF0C8F049F9E (static IP)\n * 0F27B96E-9B5A-4FAE-B639-C374BD77C1A6 (DHCP)\n\nTake note of the GUID and execute the following to switch:\n# scselect 02080D27-B377-4942-BB3A-CF0C8F049F9E\n\nYou can write a more friendly script with grep and sed to suit your taste.\n", "Q: Windows external hard drive not detected in Startup Disk List I am trying to set up an external hard drive with a copy of Windows 10 that I can boot from my MacBook Pro (Early 2015). I used the procedure posted by Alex Lambert in the following thread:\nIs it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?\nFollowing his procedure, I never received any error messages, but when I reboot my MacBook and hold down the option key, the only bootable hard drive listed is my \"Macintosh HD\". If I open System preferences-->Startup Disk, it finds my external hard drive as a Windows disk, but if I try to select it, then I get the error: \"You can't change the startup disk to the selected disk. The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk.\"\nHow can I check what is missing on the hard drive that keeps it from showing up in the startup disk selection?\n\nA: This procedure will not work for your 2015 Mac. Step 6.2.5 states: \"Run: clean\". The next step (6.2.6) states: \"Run: create partition primary\". This indicates the external drive is using the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition scheme. The 2015 and later Macs can no longer boot operating systems using this scheme. The question you refer to involved a 2014 Mac.\nThis procedure you reference requires you to download the \"Windows 7 Automated Installation Kit\" in step 3. Later, step 6.2.4 uses the imagex command from this kit. This command has been deprecated and should not be used with Windows 10. The replacement command is dism.exe, which is included in the Windows 10 installation iso. So steps 3 and 5.3 are unnecessary.\nThis procedure may be adapted for your model Mac. One change would be that the external drive needs to be using the GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme.  This is probably not the only change needed. The accepted answer to the question \"Unable to boot Windows 10 from Bootcamp external HDD\" documents another possible change that may be needed.\n", "Q: Why is my iMac shutting down randomly? I have a late 2012 27\" iMac running El Capitan (10.11.5). It is a 3.2 GHz i5 with 32GB of 1600MHz DDR3, 3TB fusion drive. It's worth noting that as of right now I can't get Graphics/Display information from the System Info tool.\nWhile using the the mac, it randomly powers off. It will not power on again until I have unplugged it for a minute or two.\nWithin the last 6 months, Apple Genius techs have replaced:\n\n\n*\n\n*Logic Board\n\n*Harddrive\n\n*power supply\n\n*Power supply connector cable (not sure what this actually is).\n\n*GPU? I don't remember if they replaced the GPU, but one of the last times I had it serviced they deliberately ran a graphics \"stress test\" for a few hours before letting me pick it up again and the test came out fine.\n\n\nHere is a portion of my Console log right before the last startup:\nhttp://pastebin.com/raw/5NKKMkA1\nMy GPU has been restarting a lot recently as well. I can provide more from the gpuRestart kernel logs if necessary.\nHow do I trouble shoot this issue? I don't see any errors in the Console logs and when the mac starts back up, there is no dialog indicating that it knows it recovered from an error.\nOther notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware check was clean.\n\n*Identical mac plugged in on the same surge protector and not having issues.\n\n*Bluetooth is disabled.\n\n*I am using a USB mouse, keyboard and headset.\n\n*My mac 'otherwise' feels healthy - nice graphics when playing a game, no UI slowness in other apps, wifi is fast. I/O is fast.\n\n*I am the only user on this mac, other than the guest account.\n\n*I cannot correlate shutdowns to running any specific program. I have changed from using Chrome to Safari with no luck. I have been running nothing but Finder when crashes happen. I have also been playing games when crashes happen.\n\n\nI am trying to debug this myself after countless sessions with Apple support repeating the same steps for an hour only to get to a point where they ask me to take it in to a Genius appointment only to have them say they can't reproduce it.\n\nA: Have you checked your device temperature? I had a similar problem with an old MacBook Pro and it was randomly shutting down because it was overheating.\nYou can check temperature with SMC Fan control or iStat Menus.\nCheck on System Monitor the power usage, that's always helpful to check what process can be making your device overheating.\nIn my case was chrome plus some developer tools that i use at work.\n", "Q: FileVault Encryption Bypass Can't get past my FileVault encryption on my Mac as I've forgotten my password. I know my admin username and password, but not my password for my FileVault on my regular user profile. I need to unlock my FileVault to even be able to switch users and login to my admin account. Also, I tried my recovery key and it doesn't seem to unlock it. Any ideas?\n\nA: Your description is a bit confused, so I'm not sure exactly what's going on. The current version of FileVault (technically FileVault 2) encrypts the entire disk, not individual accounts. It's normally set up so that any of the users' passwords can be used to unlock the volume at startup time. If you've just lost your user password on a FileVault-protected volume, but remember the password for an admin account on the same volume, just start the computer, log in to the admin account, then use the Users & Groups pane of System Preferences to reset the other user's password.\nNote that after you do this, the user account's keychain (an encrypted password database stored within the account) will still be encrypted by the account's old password. When you log in to the user account after resetting its password, you'll get an error stating that the system was unable to unlock your keychain. If you don't know the old password, there's no way to regain access to the old keychain, so the only real choice is to select \"Create New Keychain\", which discards the old database and starts over with a new (blank) password database.\nIf that's not what the problem is, then please clarify what's going on.\n\nA: There are really only two scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*You’ve lost control of all passwords that can unlock the FileVault volume.\n\n*You know one password to unlock FileVault - reset the others: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860\nIf you know one, just restart if you don’t see the fast user switching and log back in. Once you have control of the Mac - you can make a new account (just to be safe) and enable that for FileVault and then use that admin account to reset any other passwords needed to be reset. If you’ve lost control of all the passwords you can erase the Mac and start over or wait however long you think it will take to remember or find the password written down somewhere.\n", "Q: How long does an iPhone alarm last? I lost my iphone but the alarm is still on and I want to know if the alarm turns itself off or if someone calls the iPhone will the alarm turn off.\n\nA: The alarm will last about 15 minutes, according to Anna Fyen's answer on Quora:\n\nMy alarm works fine every weekday. I cannot give you the exact time. But one day, I set an alarm and let it ring for a while so after about 15 minutes or so of ringing it turns itself off and displays a message on the lock screen.\n\nPhoning an iPhone currently playing the alarm will likely interrupt the alarm and replace the sound with that of the ring tone.\n", "Q: iCloud setting on iPhone changed without user intervention I have an iPhone 5s, running iOS 9.3.2.\nAbout an hour ago, I restored my iPhone and set it up as a new iPhone.\nWhen I signed into iCloud on my iPhone, I turned off all the features I do not use (I only use Find my iPhone and calendar/contacts syncing), and proceeded to connect my iPhone to my Macbook (early 2015 13\" Pro model, running OS X 10.11.5) in order to sync the apps, music and podcasts that had been downloaded by that point in time.\nAfter completing a sync for the first time, I checked my iCloud settings about 15 minutes after setting up iCloud on my iPhone and noticed that the Backup feature had been turned back on, even though I hadn't been back into iCloud settings and even though turned it off when I first signed in.\nContextual information:\n\n\n*\n\n*Phone was not jailbroken/has never been jailbroken.\n\n*I definitely turned off the Backup feature the first time because I\nmade sure to see that \"Off\" was next to the iCloud Backup option.\n\n*I don't use the backup iPhone to iCloud feature at all.\n\n*None of the other features that I had turned off changed back\nto On, just the backup feature.\n\n*I had just wiped and restored my iPhone/did not use a backup when\nsetting it up as new.\n\n*My Macbook was also freshly installed (reinstalled about three hours\nbefore doing my iPhone).\n\n*I'm the only person who uses this phone and no one else had touched\nit (while setting up my Macbook and iPhone, I was alone).\n\n*This issue happened only once before - this \"issue\" being that I reinstalled the OSes on my Macbook and iPhone, set both of them up and then came back to see\nthat one of the iCloud settings on my iPhone had changed by itself\n(in this particular instance it was Photos syncing, which I don't\nuse). In the numerous times I've reinstalled my Macbook and iPhone in the past year, it hasn't happened.\n\n\nSo, has anyone had settings change themselves? What could explain this setting turning itself back on again? Am I just being paranoid about something malicious already being on my iPhone? Honestly, I don't have much but reinstalling my Macbook and iPhone so many times before takes a lot of time, effort and money.\n\nA: Kind of happened to me. Log out of iCloud and log back in.

Now my question: How do I copy a Mail setup to a different computer of which both are running El Capitan.\nIn the even more earlier days we even had mail account config synchronisation via iCloud on multiple macs. Apple pulled that feature and never re-introduced it. \n\nA: I am answering my own question. I know it is possible to transfer user data from one mac to another by using the migration assistant. In my case this does not apply because I only want to copy my complex Mail setup and no other data and config.\nAfter some experiments I found the following to be working:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your destination Mac in SystemPreferences/Sharing activate File Sharing\n\n*Important: Log out of your user account on the destination mac.\n\n*Quit Mail on your source mac if it is running.\n\n*On your source mac mount your destination mac user folder.\n\n*Copy ~/Library/Mail to the same location in your destination user folder\n\n*Copy ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail to the same location in your destination user folder.\n\n*Copy ~/Library/Accounts to the same location in your destination user folder.\n\n*Restart your destination mac and log in to your User Account.

It wouldn’t turn on, even after long-pressing the power button or resetting the SMC (System Management Controller). The SMC reset caused the battery indicator light to go from green to red, but even after ten minutes of supposed charging it is not responding to the power button.

My MacBook suddenly crashed yesterday. On startup, the computer would always shut down after a few seconds. I used ⌘ Command R to go into Disk Utility from Recovery HD to see what the problem was and the partition with OS X (Yosemite) could not be verified. I have 2 partitions one named BOOTCAMP (for Windows) and the other Macintosh HD (for OS X). The Windows partition was working properly. \nOn clicking repair for Macintosh HD I got a message saying the disk could not be repaired due to \"error code 8\". I formatted the disk and tried to reinstall the OS but I got an error saying that \"file system verify or repair failed\". \nI was told that a possible solution is to go to single-user mode and type fsck -fy as that repairs the disk. I did that and there were no problems detected however I still could not install the OS and I was getting the same error. I then went back to Disk Utility and removed the Macintosh HD partition. I thought that since the BOOTCAMP partition was working I could try splitting the Macintosh HD partition into smaller partitions and see if there was an error in them.\nI split the available free space into 4 smaller partitions and verified each of them; only one of them had a problem. The others were working perfectly. I then played around with the partitions and I now have a partition of around 250 GB that works properly with Yosemite installed and a chunk of free space (that was previously occupied by the partitions that was not working) and the partition for BOOTCAMP (Windows).\nSo I solved the problem I was initially facing but my question is will this affect my MacBook or my data negatively in any way? Also was the problem caused because of a hard disk failure?\n\nA: Typically, if you have a spinning hard disk drive (not an SSD or Solid State Drive) and there is a physical problem with the drive, you will get the symptoms you have described. So the first answer to your question is: yes, it is possible for only one part of a hard drive to malfunction. This has been, for me, the more frequent kind of problem, often accompanied by clicks or repetitive noises emanating from the drive itself. This may appear in the OS as one or more unreadable files (if they are in a document or user file), stuttering performance (depending on how unreadable the media is), or strange behavior by the OS (if a system file is located on a damaged portion of the disk). \nYou should back up all of your data immediately. Your disk is failing and is no longer reliable. Typically, a disk with a physical continues to accumulate physical faults. Drives get more bad sectors over time, not fewer.\n", "Q: Calendar Synchronization Why does my iPhone calendar not sync with my Mac computer calendar?  When I enter appointments in my Mac calendar they download automatically to my iPhone but when I enter an appointment in my iPhone it does not get synced or uploaded to my Mac.\n\nA: Make sure that both your Mac and iPhone have calendar in iCloud turned on. If they do, try logging out of iCloud and then logging back in. If not, try using another calendar account like Yahoo or Gmail.\n", "Q: Will Bluetooth speakers and/or USB speakers work for sound when there is a broken headphone jack stuck in my macbook port? I bought a Macbook for a low price because it has a headphone jack broken off in its port. I have tried some of the fixes for removing the jack, but it is broken deep in the port and unfortunately didn't come out in one clean piece. I would really like to be able to have some sort of audio, and I'm willing to buy Bluetooth speakers or speakers that plug into the USB, but first I want to know whether they will override the headphone port. \nAlso, the volume control on the menu is greyed out so I can't control volume. I have read that you can fix that by removing and reinserting your headphone jack, but I obviously can't do that here. \nDoes anyone know whether that will prevent me from using other speakers?\n[]\n[]2\n\nA: Yes, a Bluetooth and/or a USB speaker will \"override\" your audio input.  It all depends on how you configure it.\nIn System Preferences > Sound, you can setup which audio device does what.\nFor example, in my setup, I play all the \"Sound Effects\" through the Internal Speakers, however, I could select the USB Audio device I also have installed.  For your case, you would select either the USB/Bluetooth Device.\n\nYou could even use both a Bluetooth audio device and a USB device\nFor example, in my Output configuration, I can choose Internal, USB Audio, or Bluetooth\n\nAnd...\nDepending on your Application, it can even select which audio device to use for it's individual output.  Here's the configuration screen from VOX:\n\n", "Q: Iphone lost with not connection Lost my Iphone 6, I didn't activate the lost mode, can't see the phone on my Icloud, is there anyway I can locate my phone or is it lost?\n\nA: You can go to your cellphone provider and ask them to locate it, this will work if the battery hasn't been run down. If it's stolen the thief probably crushed the SIM card and it cannot be located in any manner that I know of.. \n", "Q: Cancel an autocorrect suggestion while typing When I am typing, OSX helpfully offers and inserts corrections for me.\nHowever, sometimes I do not want these corrections, as they can ruin an otherwise flawless piece of writing (see the below example.)\nLifting my hands from the keyboard, gripping the mouse and then dragging the mouse across my frictious desk before contracting the muscles along my entire finger to squeeze the mouse and activate its clicking procedure actually takes a very long time.\nHow can I cancel autocorrect suggestions without needing to use my mouse?\n\n\nA: Hitting ESC to get rid of the autocorrect suggestion works for me.\n\nA: Simple...\nUp arrow  ↑  then continue. \n", "Q: Cycle between Mac apps and VMware 7 using cmd+tab I am trying to understand how I could switch back and forth in a productive manner when using a combination of VMware Fusion 7 and OS X El Capitan apps.\nThe keyboard shortcut that I am used to use thousands of times a day between Mac apps is cmd+tab. I use it to cycle between apps, and would love to be able to do this to switch to other apps when inside VMware Fusion.\nWhat it currently does when I press cmd+tab from within VMware Fusion is that it will cycle through the windows of the virtual Windows machine, not take me out of the virtual machine and into my Mac apps again.\nThis is clicked in my Virtual Machine settings:\n\nAfter looking online for a while, I found this tip, which doesn't work for me. This, although more subsequent, didn't seem to provide a workaround that would allow the user to use cmd+tab to get out of VMware Fusion. This didn't help, and this didn't help either. \nI also looked fruitlessly into the Windows 7 Control Panels for a way to disable cycling through windows in Windows with that shortcut, which didn't work.\n\nA: I had this same issue, which I resolved by enabling mission control (I had disabled it).\ndefaults write com.apple.dock mcx-expose-disabled -bool FALSE && killall Dock\n\n\nA: In the same settings window, just below, is a dropdown menu that lets you choose which of the command-keys should represent the \"Windows\" key in your VM. The default seems to be both, which breaks all the native Mac shortcuts. Set it to one or the other, and all the usual Mac shortcuts work as long as you use the Command key that you didn't choose to represent the \"Windows\" key.\n", "Q: Finder doesn't find duplicates with (1), (2), …, (n) in filename I have downloaded lots of duplicate files with my web browser. The first duplicate gets the suffix (1) in its filename before the file extension, the second gets (2) and so on.\nFor example: my_music_file(1).mp3\nI'm trying to purge these duplicates by searching for (1), (2) and so forth in Finder, but for some reason it does not find the files. Probably because the duplicate suffixes are concatenated with the original file name, without whitespaces before the suffixes.\nCan I find these duplicates using a name string search in Finder?\nOr indeed by some other OS X native method?\n\nA: EasyFind (freeware) will often find things Spotlight won't - including such as (1)\nNo affiliation.\n", "Q: How to view photos from all years on map? In the iPhone Photos app, I am able to view a map with all of the photos from a given year when I am in the Photos/Years tab. Is it possible to do the same thing except with all photos, spanning all of the years? Or is a single year the highest level of aggregation that is possible?\n\nA: Currently, year view is the highest level you can view a map for. With iOS 10, this is expanded to viewing all photos together on the map, but iOS 10 is not available yet at the time of writing.\n", "Q: See other's Android location on an iPhone I have an Android phone (Nexus 6P) and my wife has an iPhone 6.\nWe would like to have the same functionality as Find My Friends offers, without both having iPhones.\nThus, we share each other's location through Google.\nI have no problem seeing her location on my Android.\nPreviously, my wife could see my location using the iPhone Google+ app. There used to be a Locations tab in the app, showing my location. Now, the Location tab is gone. The Google support article \"See friends' locations on a map\" is obsolete.\nIs there any other way on an iPhone to see someone else's location information?\nWe both have location history, reporting and sharing in Google turned on. My wife has both the Google+ and the Google app installed and running on the iPhone (and is logged in, of course).\n\nA: My family—one Nexus 6P user and two iPhone 6 users—is really happy with Life360. It provides just the same service as Find My Friends (letting family members view each other's current location), just cross-platform. It isn't battery intensive, works great, and even has some additional features as compared to Find My Friends. \nLife360 is free on Google Play and the App Store.\n\nA: For Android, try https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.bjuremo.hereiam.lite\nIt can share with email, text messages or through other apps\n", "Q: iCloud backup restore from iOS 8.4 to iOS 9.3 possible? I’m sending a relative my old iPhone 5s running iOS 9.3.2 because her beloved iPhone 5c has finally given up the ghost. Her iPhone is running iOS 8.4.1. Ordinarily I’d advise her to upgrade to iOS 9.3.2, but unfortunately her device only has 250 MB available, which I don’t believe is sufficient to update iOS. And she doesn’t have access to a Mac or PC for performing the update via iTunes.\nMy question is will she be able to restore an iCloud backup made with iOS 8.4.1 on to the replacement iPhone running iOS 9.3.2? I know that sometimes the restore process can be fussy about major version number differences.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There shouldn't be a problem. I believe I've done an iCloud transfer from iOS 5.1.1 to iOS 7.0.4, which is a much larger gap.\nIf anything, going from iOS 9.3.2 to iOS 8.4.1 might be a problem, but you aren't doing that, so you'll be fine.\niCloud is built with moving to a new device in mind. It wouldn't make much sense for Apple to make it impossible to restore a backup from a previous iOS version.\n", "Q: iPhone audio bluetooth I have a 2012 Prius C. The Bluetooth for the phone works fine but the audio to play music from my iPhone will not play over the car radio.  Why does one work and not the other?  How do I fix it?  Thx.\n\nA: Here's the relevant passage from the 2012 Prius C's user manual:\nBefore using the Bluetooth® audio/phone, it is necessary to register a Bluetooth® device in the system. Follow the procedure below to reg-\nister (pair) a device:\nPress the tune knob and select “Bluetooth” using the tune knob.\nPress the tune knob and select “Pairing” using the tune knob.\nA passkey will be displayed.\nInput the passkey into the device.\nSelect “Yes” to register the device. Depending on the type of device, it may register automatically.\nIf a Bluetooth® device has both music player and cellular phone func-\ntions, both functions will be registered at the same time. When delet-\ning the device, both functions will be deleted at the same time.\nIf the off-hook switch is pressed and the “PHONE” mode is entered\nwhen no phones have been registered, the registration screen will be\nautomatically displayed.\nBasically, the music should just work. Try re-setting it up again and report back by commenting under this answer.\n\nA: I cannot give you specific steps as I don't own that car, but in many vehicles, there are different settings for phone-use bluetooth and media-streaming bluetooth. In my car, you must specify which option the device should be used for. I know this answer doesn't solve your problem off the bat, but go into your car's manual and check it out. Or check in different menus, like preferences, phone, or media. Good luck.\n", "Q: Why do I keep jumping between items when scrolling in reading list? Why do I keep jumping between items when scrolling when reading an item in reading list on iOS?\n\nA: I’ve also had this problem. Couldn’t figure out why it was sometimes randomly jumping and sometimes not. Maybe I flick the screen in strange ways? I was able to work around it with this Pythonista script. It reopens the same page in the same tab. Breaks it free from the reading list. So the whole scroll to the end to jump to a different item doesn’t work anymore, but I never really used that, preferring to manually pick the next item. \nFrom the link:\nimport appex\nimport requests\nimport webbrowser\n\n\ndef main():\n    if not appex.is_running_extension():\n        url = 'http://arstechnica.com'\n    else:\n        url = appex.get_url()\n    if url:\n        webbrowser.get('safari').open(url)\n    else:\n        print('No input URL found.')\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\n\nA: When you scroll further than the end or beginning of an item in your Reading List, it switches to the next or previous item respectively. This only occurs if you scroll beyond the end, but this seems to be what you're doing.\n", "Q: Making ~/.bashrc function callable to set up an environment I have an installed app lets call it my_app that I wish to be able to call from the command line. It is located in /Applications/my_app.app/Contents/Resources.\nSo what I was hoping to do was to have my ~/.bashrc look like the following: \n# .bashrc\n\nmy_app-start(){\nexport PATH=$PATH:/Applications/my_app.app/Contents/Resources/\n}\n\nand then every time I want to be able to use the app from a new terminal session I would load call my_app-start after which I expect my app to be callable by simply typing my_app anywhere on my system. However my terminal does not recognise the my_app-start function... On another linux platform this works for me but perhaps Macs need some fiddling with ~/.bash_profile. I never understood the difference. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I make the function automatically callable?\n\n*Is this method a safe, sensible way of loading my application?\n\n\nA: Your function doesn't work because OS X starts your shell as a login shell, thus .bashrc isn't read. I wouldn't use a function in this case.\nIf there is only one executable file in /Applications/my_app.app/Contents/Resources/ then I would use an alias.\nI would use separate files when changing your environment.

I have a Mac Mini (late 2012) and have added a new hard disk drive in it. But Mac OS 10.10.5 is unable to detect it. If this were a PC, I'd check the BIOS to see if it was detected and listed there, to rule out hdd cable or connection issues. But as I understand it, Mac Mini's have EFI. \nWhat is the BIOS equivalent to a Mac EFI, to check if a drive is detected by the system?\n(P.S: The drive is not shown in \"Disk Utility\". I have even swapped the drives and HDD cables to check cable issue, but the drive is still not detected.)\n\nA: There is no specific way to get into BIOS/EFI easily on the Mac. It is possible to get into NVRAM from boot and from a shell (type man nvram) but I am unsure you will be able to do anything there that will have an effect on the new drive.\nPC manufacturers give access to this because they don't make the operating system. Apple does not because it's software and hardware are better integrated. So if Disk Utility does not see the drive then there is a problem. Possibly with the cabling, my thought being that adding a drive to a mini is a bit finicky.\nYou could try zapping the PRAM (COMMAND OPTION P R at boot, wait for a second bong then release those keys). I would be tempted to check the connections and cables and even try the new drive in an external (known good) case to verify the drive is OK\n", "Q: Network folder in finder sidebar disappears I have added a couple of network folders to the OS X finder sidebar as a shortcut. This is working great as long as I don't shutdown or restart the system. Once the system has been restarted they are no longer visible in finder sidebar. I have also added a Automator script that auto mounts my afp network drive on startup.\nWhy do network folders disappear? What can do?\n\nA: Drag the folder from the share to your desktop (Hold CMD and Alt). Then add that alias to the sidebar\n\nA: I kept losing folders on an SMB share that I'd dragged to the Finder Favorites. They would stay for a day or two, then vanish. None of the solutions I found online seemed to help (reboot, \nI found a way to make them stay there: Make an alias (with contextual menu) to the folder on the SMB share you want a link to.

Last night my iMac started making noises similar to that of a disk drive when it's reading and writing. \nAfter poking around I found that the noise must be related to the GPU because:\n\n\n*\n\n*The noises increase when scrolling a webpage or change workspaces and then subside when I stop.\n\n*Running a web GPU benchmark or watching a video will make the noise constant until I close it\n\n*Also changing the brightness causes the noise\n\n\nI doesn't sound like a bad fan as it's a very clicky noise versus a whine or hum.\nI ran the hardware diagnostic test (Holding D when you restart) which resulted in no errors. I tried to blow some air in the GPU vents which didn't change anything.\nI feel if I take the iMac in and describe the issue they will send the iMac away for few weeks and it will be sent back saying there isn't any issues.\nAny suggestions?\nEDIT\nHere is what it sounds like. It also makes this sound when the display is off, so it could be like @Allan said that it is the power supply.\n\nA: There are only a few components in an iMac that can make clicking noises.\nIt's highly unlikely that it's your logic board or a component of your logic board, but the possibilities are:\n\n*\n\n*Power Supply\n\n*Hard Drive\n\n*Speakers\n\n*CPU Fan\n\nI've included a sample picture and the location of the components in the picture below\n\n\nPower Supply\nThere are a number of components on the power supply that could be at fault here from capacitors, transformers, relays, etc.  I have provided the posterior view (what you are seeing in the top picture is the anterior) of the power supply\n\nHard Drive\nYou said you only have a 256GB SSD, so, it's unlikely that you have a traditional spinning hard drive, but, to make sure, issue the command diskutil list in Terminal and post the output\nSpeakers\nIt's not out of the realm of possibility that you have a malfunctioning speaker(s).  Try turning off the sound or better yet, plug in a headphone so it forces output to that device.  if the sound goes away, it will be something associated with your speakers\nCPU fan\nYou said that the sound was more \"clicking\" than a whir or a hum.  However, it is still possible that some debris is interfering with the operation of the fan or it may be a defect in the motor.\n\nHow to fix\nBased on your comments, I tend to agree that the power supply is the culprit given that it persists when the display is off or even while sleeping.\nThe good news here is that these components are relatively inexpensive. A quick search on Amazon  yields the power supply for about $120.  I have bought from this vendor for my own iMac and had good results (I am not affiliated with them).\nThe best option, if you don't have the tech skills to open this up is to have a pro take a look at it.

If you get a new iPhone, when setting it up, you can choose to set it up from a backup, and that new phone will have all of the data your current phone has. The sync is as complete as backing it up to a Mac. Also—try the Google Photos (not Google Drive) app for awesome photo backups. \nIf you need any help backing your phone up with iCloud or iTunes, check out Apple's support article.\nNote: you can very easily get a new sync cable for your iPhone from Amazon.

About a week ago, Apple sent me an email implying that I must renew the certificate before it expires in one month. However, I expect to submit some apps in at least a couple of months, and I would prefer to wait until this time to renew my certificate. Can I do this long after it has expired, or must I renew it before the expiration date?\n\n\n\nA: You may renew your Developer account whenever you want. Just keep in mind: All your 'live' apps in the App Store will go offline when your membership expires.

What you have to do after installing Better Touch Tool is : \n\n\n*\n\n*Go in Trackpad sections (or Keyboard if you don't have Trackpad)\n\n*In the left sidebar select Global\n\n*Click Add a new gesture\n\n*Select a gesture (I personally use 3 Fingers Swipe down)\n\n*In Predefined Actions, search for Close Window Below Cursor (Works in Mission Control)\nYou're set !\nNOTE : Even if the window is successfully closed in Mission Control,\nit still maintains the outline for the app\n\nA: No (maintained/working) free solutions exist\nTL;DR after extensive testing I cannot recommend Better Touch Tool I mentioned below.\n\n*\n\n*Gesture (if global) could be triggered even if mission control isn't open. So using a two finger swipe down could close any application at any time.\n\n*Rather than making it global assigning a gesture to Mission Control doesn't work. The gesture then no longer works and the application isn't closed.\n(Legacy versions of) BetterTouchTool is the only free solution but it's unmaintained and buggy.\n\nAltTab\n\nAn alternative application is AltTab, it achieves the exact same thing as Mission Control - and more. You could see it as the Windows 10 version of Windows management.\nThere are two ways to close windows using AltTab.\nOpen AltTab using Alt+Tab:\n\n*\n\n*Then press the Red X in the top right\n\n*Press W on the \"focused\" (mini) window\n\nTwo modifications are required to make it like Mission Control\n\n*\n\n*Open AltTab from Launchpad -> Controls > Show Window From > Visible Spaces\n\n*Open AltTab from Launchpad -> Appearance -> Hide apps with no open windows\n\nInstalling Better Touch Tool (legacy version)\n\n*\n\n*Visit https://folivora.ai/downloads\n\n*Select Previous Versions\n\n*Choose 2.05 which begin the download (this is the latest legacy free version available that works I tried https://www.boastr.net/ which has 2.342 but it didn't work on macOS Big Sur)\n\n*Extract it\n\n*There is an intermittent bug where a prompt keeps flashing to the foreground then background (and repeats) telling you to give BetterTouchTool permission (occurs one in three times). If this happens it's just asking you to go to System preferences > Security and Privacy > Accessibility and give BetterTouchTool permission. It stops if you either reinstall or give permission.\n\n*Visit https://www.boastr.net/ to get a license otherwise it's only 45 days.

However, if you have a trackpad or touchpad, you may find that using a gesture instead of a keyboard shortcut avoids the problems outlined in the question linked to by Anthonin C. If this is something that interests you, then you would:\n\n*\n\n*Install BTT\n\n*Add a new global gesture\n\n*Set up a Touchpad Gesture (such as a 3 finger click)\n\n*Set the Predefined Action as Close window below cursor\nThis will then work from Mission control.\nClosing apps\nBy the way, if you're wanting to close an App rather than just a window, you can also do this via the heads-up display. More specifically:\n\n*\n\n*Press commandtab to open the heads-up display\n\n*Keep holding the command key once when you see the heads-up display\n\n*Cycle through the apps by pressing the tab key or the ~ key\n\n*Once the app you want to quit is selected, press the Q key to quit the app\n\nNOTE: - You could also use the heads up display to quickly navigate to an App and, once there, use the command+W keyboard shortcut to close the window. However, if you have multiple windows open you could inadvertently close the wrong window.\n\nUPDATE re Better Touch Tool\nThe developer of this app has set up a new site for its distribution.\nLegacy versions of his apps (released before February 2018) can still be used for free.\n", "Q: How to Lock apps using FingerPrint in iPhone Can we lock other apps (eg.Facebook, Twitter) with fingerprint using Xcode. \n\nA: No you can't, as you can't handle access over other apps then your own app.\n", "Q: Revert to 9.3 from 10 beta 1 I took a backup on icloud and installed ios 10 beta 1 now I want to go back to iOS 9.3, so I used the option reset settings and data but still I'm on 10 beta 1. Please help me out.\nPs- I don't have my laptop with me nor I made any backup on iTunes.\n\nA: Well, If you don't have a backup of iOS 9.3, you might not be able to get your data back. Haven't tried it, but if you downgrade, and then set it up as a new device, and then restored your data from iCloud, you might get your data back. Don't take my word for it.\nAlso, you will need to have access to a computer running iTunes. You cannot go back to iOS 9 without it.\nTo downgrade to a fresh install of iOS 9.3 there are a couple of steps, and you need a good internet connection, a computer with iTunes, your device, and a cable to connect the device. \n\n\n*\n\n*Head over to ipsw.me (On a Computer) and download the latest iOS 9.3.x ipsw\nstill being signed by apple (It is in green) for your device. As of July 8, iOS 9.3.2 is being signed by apple for all supported devices.\n\n*Connect your iDevice to your computer running iTunes, and make a full backup just incase. (Worst case scenario, you'll have to go back to iOS 10 if you don't get your data back from iCloud). The download is 1-2 GB, and it might take a while depending on your internet speed. \n\n*Go to the Summary Page of iTunes (Should automatically show up when you connect your device and open iTunes).\n\n*Alt+Click the \"Restore\" button (On a Mac, option+click), and select the ipsw file you downloaded earlier.\n\n*After a while, it will have restored your device, and you should be back on a clean copy of iOS 9.3.x.\n\n*Try restoring your data from a backup on iCloud, or try from the full backup you made earlier on iTunes. It will restore your data, however, I have no clue if it will take you back to iOS 10. (Again, worst case scenario, you will have to stay on iOS 10, and you won't lose your data since you have 2 working backups on iCloud and iTunes)\nRemember, don't try out beta software, especially not the first beta. If you do not know what you're getting yourself into, or if you do want to try out beta software, do it on a different device or make sure you have a working backup before you jump ship.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you will need a computer with iTunes.

I have concluded that there is no standard, guaranteed way to get the open documents of a running application.\nWhat you tried is the best method. For apps that use the Cocoa document architecture (the majority), there is automatic AppleScript support for getting all the open NSDocument objects and querying certain properties of those objects. The mapping between the AppleScript properties and the Objective-C properties is shown below.\nAppleScript property => Objective-C getter:\n\n\n*\n\n*path => fileName\n\n*modified => isDocumentEdited\n\n*name => lastComponentOfFileName\nWhat you want is the path property. Like tell application \"Preview\" to set documentsList to path of documents.\nUnfortunately, this automatic AppleScript support is only available for apps that use the Cocoa document architecture and have AppleScript enabled (via the NSAppleScriptEnabled Info.plist key). Therefore, this method will not work on some apps. For example, CodeRunner does not have AppleScript enabled. And TextMate does not use the Cocoa document architecture.\n", "Q: What stops step data from the accelerometers on the phone and watch from doubling up? We see that the Apple Watch sends step data from its accelerometers to the iPhone 6 (and above) which also has accelerometers. \nWhen you walk holding both an (recent) Apple phone and Apple Watch - you trigger accelerometers on both. This raises the risk of duplicate data. \nWe can see data from both devices in the health App. \nMy question is: What stops step data from the accelerometers on the phone and watch from doubling up?\n\nA: Apple Health is smart. It automatically aggregates step data, so that every minute, it takes the step count from the last 60 seconds from the device with the highest input and adds that to the daily total. It knows when the measurements from each device were started and when they ended, and it makes sure to not include any steps from two sources measured at the same time. This is a post-processing thing, not in the time of measurement: it's not that the Apple Watch shuts off the iPhone's accelerometer; rather, they both generate step data, as in your screenshot, but Health figures out which step counts to use from both in an aggregation-type process after the fact, getting you the most accurate and complete step count possible, while not exaggerating.\n", "Q: .plist returns: Invalid property list, plutil says ok!

This should have been a valid option but instead of pasting and matching the style, the result was it didn't paste anything.\n\nA: So all of the above unfortunately didn't work for me.

I have a first generation Apple TV (with the 40 Gb hard drive) lying unused, in a storage box at home. I'm unsure if there's anything useful I can do with it, so was considering getting rid of it.\nI understand that there are various ways that the device can be modified or jailbroken, but I don't know if these are still worthwhile or still supported in any way. After doing some research they just seem to install other media playback software.\nI'm more interested in being able to stream content - ideally from services like BBC iPlayer, YouTube or Netflix. Is there any way the device can run or stream from any of these services? (I'm aware there is a YouTube client installed on the device already, but it's very old).\nApologies if this seems a strange question, but is there any point in keeping one of these, in 2016? Can anything useful or interesting be done with them now?\n\nA: Apparently not much these days unless you want to play standard definition content or heavily mod the thing.\nSee here for more info on making it into a useful device for that purpose (Kodi can be configured to stream media from those services you mentioned):\nhttp://kodi.wiki/view/Apple_TV_1\n", "Q: Is there a way to request iMessage history from Apple?

There may be instances of iMessage data in iCloud Backup. This data can be extracted by various recovery programs, but not \"requested\" from Apple.\nEven if you do store it on iCloud it is encrypted is not accessible in the fashion you are requesting it.\nYou can however request a copy of all the data Apple has.\n\nA: As far as I know Apple doesn't store your iMessage history.

Unfortunately some of my apps are stuck on \"Waiting..\" stage. One of them is very important for me, it's Stash (http://hedonicsoftware.com/stash.html). It's an application to store documents, photos with password. I tried to find it under App Store -> Purchased tab, but it's not there. I have very important stuff in this app, so I would like to restore the application or the data. I think the app data should be in the cloud, but I can't read/download this data without the app. \nWhat can I do? (I have the latest iOS)\n\nA: Did you ever sync or backup to iTunes? If you could restore from backup from iTunes that wouldn't be a problem, but short of that you could still see if it has the app you could copy to your phone. Not sure if that would include the documents and data though.\nIf by any chance that app syncs over iCloud or some other cloud service, the raw files may still be accessible (but still likely encrypted).\nI personally would contact the app developers and see if they have any ideas.\n", "Q: Transfer Word and pdf files between PC and iPhone How can I transfer Word and pdf files from iPhone to PC and PC to iPhone without using iTunes?\nAlso, when no internet access is available, how smart and slick is iPhone in reality?  Android phones can do this in a flick and no expertise is required.\n\nA: You have various options. You can use a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive and that will let you access files there or save files to there on either device.\nI'm not very familiar with Windows, but depending on the version of iOS you're running you may be able to plug it in over USB to your PC and use some program to browse the file system on the phone (on Mac I can use iFunBox or something like that, but I only resort to that in special cases). That would work if you don't have Internet access but you do have USB access.\nI don't quite understand the other part of your question. Like any smartphone, an iPhone works best if it is online (cellular or WiFi).

However, as of watchOS 2.x, this is no longer the case, as that data now gets backed up to your iPhone.\nIt seems you are left with three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take your WATCH on a few walks with the Workout app, hoping it eventually recalibrates itself.\n\n*Reset your WATCH as new by going into the Settings app on your WATCH.\n\n*Unpair your WATCH and perform an unencrypted backup of your iPhone to iTunes. Then restore your iPhone from backup, and pair your WATCH once again. You will lose all health data, passwords, etc. from your iPhone as well.\n\n\nSeems #2 would be the most straightforward approach, although you could try #1 for a while and see if that’s enough.\nI added #3 for completeness’s sake only \n\nA: Here is another option: In running trails with my Apple Watch and iPhone the calibration is not correct. Miles is not correct because of switch backs and trees. What I do is go to the Watch app on my iPhone, Tap the My Watch tab then tap Privacy > Motion & Fitness > Reset Calibration Data. This erases the calibration and I can start over with a clean slate.

Only file system objects that end in hpp are echoed because -exec negates the default behavior of find to print. You could add -exec echo {} \\; or -print at the end of each enclosed parentheses but that's silly.\nLet's fix the \"one that works\"\nfind ~/src -type f \\( -iname '*.cpp' -or -iname '*.h' -or -iname '*.c' -or -iname '*.hpp' \\) -exec echo {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Split video in iMovie 10.1.1 I have a 45-minute long video; I've split it into about 20 segments (things separated by a black vertical bar in the timeline, produced using the ⌘ Command B  \"Split clip\" operation). \nI'd now like to export each of these, but when I select one and go to \"Share...\", iMovie seems to want to export the whole 45 minute video. \nCan someone suggest a way to export just one of these 2-minute clips/segments/whatever-they're-called? \nI ask in advance: please explain in the most pedestrian terms -- I've used iMovie for about 45 minutes so far, and a moment ago I had to look up \"where is the 'Project Window' in iMovie.\" That shoudl give you some idea of the depths of my ignorance. \n(I did a pretty extensive web search on this, with no luck, partly because this has been asked lots of times, and there are answers for many versions of iMovie, which all seem to have inconsistent naming conventions, like version 9.something being called \"iMovie 11\", etc.  I'm sure the answer's out there somewhere, but my search-fu was not strong enough...)\n\nA: iMovie is a little weird about exporting individual video clips.

So, once you have the IEEE standard used, you should be able to resolder a new connector with no problem.  In this case, the USB connector used on the Apple Keyboard is a USB v1.1 connector.\n\nI have included the pinouts for USB 1.1/2.0 below for reference.\n\nShort of that, I am sure you could use the continuity function on a multi-meter on a USB cable to figure out which pin goes where \n", "Q: Can I damage my machine if I restart it multiple times? Today I had to restart my rMBP multiple times (2-3 times, one after another) due to a software update, can it damage my machine (logic board, ssd, ram memory) at all?

The only way that restarting can do that type of damage is if you restart while operations are still active (i.e. an EFI update or disk activity).  Other than that, you are pretty safe.\n", "Q: How can I setup two iCloud Keychains? I want to replicate my Keychain setup for OS X in iCloud Keychain, to have passwords sync between iOS and OS X devices.\nThe way I set it up was following this article. The idea is having the default login Keychain for all Wi-Fi and system passwords that remains unlocked after login, and a separate Keychain for website passwords that is kept locked and requires a password in order to access the passwords when needed.\nI would like to access these website passwords from my iOS devices in this same way, only when I set up iCloud Keychain, the login Keychain automatically became the iCloud Keychain.\nIs there anyway to have to separate iCloud Keychains syncing between my devices?\nAlternatively, is there any other way to make the passwords in my secondary Keychain available in iOS?\n\nA: There's no way to have more than a single iCloud Keychain I'm afraid. Other Keychains you create locally on your Mac are only for use on that Mac.\nUntil Apple allows Keychain Management on iOS from Settings you're out of luck. If you're interested to know how iCloud Keychain works, see here: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204085\n\nA: While there's no way to set up or even view 2 iCloud Keychains on the same user, you can add multiple macOS users and set an iCloud account each. This will not let you use them at the same time, but at least you're one user-switch away from using the other keychain.\nI use this to occasionally access a business’ password manager.\nAlso this *might* allow you to load this secondary keychain into your user’s Keychain Access.app but I don't know if/how it will work and whether it causes trouble. It's very likely that this keychain won't be automatically synced until you switch to the other user. This part is untested.

Is there any way to remotely make a Mac which is powered on – but locked – to go to sleep and/or shut down? If so, how?\nE.g. can I use another Mac B to login via screen sharing to Mac A even if it's locked, and shut it down? Or can I use some other tool, like a remote Alfred script that can execute in the background even if the target computer is locked?\nFor this question, we are assuming that I am an administrator and have the login details to the target computer.\n\nA: In order for a user on a remote computer to shut down another computer whether it's a Mac or a PC, they have to have access to it first.\nWhether you are using screen sharing or doing this via terminal, regardless of the computer's state (locked or unlocked), if the user has access and the requisite privilege , they can log in and initiate a shutdown.\nIt's very important to recognize that to shutdown a Mac, you don't need another Mac.  You can do it from Windows, FreeBSD, or Linux.\n\nIn terminal\nUsing an SSH client (Terminal on a OS X) you would log into the remote machine with username/password and machine IP/DNS Name\nssh username@foo.bar\nPassword:\n\nIf you have the appropriate credentials, you would issue the command\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nYou could issue these commands regardless if the system was locked or not, even if someone was logged in and working at the time.\nScreen Sharing\nBy using another Mac and it's screen sharing capability or via VNC, you could easily connect to the remote screen, and shutdown the machine even from the lock screen (notice the bottom icons):\n\n", "Q: How can I install es_AR locale on OSX El Capitan?

I have a 2011 Mac mini that I have completely removed OS X from and installed Windows 10 instead.\nSince Boot Camp only supports Windows 7 for this Mac, I did not use it. I just formatted the drive, stuck the Windows 10 DVD in and installed it directly. Then I grabbed the drivers from Boot Camp and manually installed each one.\nMy problem is the computer does not have a Startup Disk set. I have to hold option and choose Windows everytime I boot the machine up. Is there a way to permanently set the Startup Disk to Windows without OS X available and without using the Windows Boot Camp utility? The utility will not install, as it detects I'm not using Windows 7 and bails.\n\nA: You should not of had to install the drivers manually. If you right click on setup.exe from the \"Boot Camp Support Software\", you should be able to select compatibility mode. You say you formatted the drive. It would help if you explained what utility you used to do this. My concern is for how Windows determines the drive partitioning. For your model/year Mac, Windows should be installed in MBR/BIOS mode. \nIf the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" is installed correctly, then you can select the startup disk from the Boot Camp pane on the Control Panel.\nAnother option which works on most later Macs, is to hold down the alt/option key on startup. When the icon labeled Windows appears, hold down the control key and select Windows. This will make Windows the default operation system.\nHere Is Some Advice on the Boot Camp Support Software.\nAccording to the Apple web site \"Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp\", the proper \"Boot Camp Support Software\" (BCSS) for installing 64 bit Windows 7 on your model Mac is \"Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621\". According to the Apple web site \"Use Windows 8.1 on your Mac with Boot Camp\", your model also supports 64 bit Windows 8.1. For this version of Windows, Apple requires you to use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the BCSS to a flash drive. You can download this software without installing Windows 8.1 to your Mac.\nOne of the machines, I have access to, is a 2011 iMac. It uses the same version of BCSS as your Mac mini for the installation of 64 bit Windows 7. I verified that the BCSS for installing 64 bit Windows 8.1 on this iMac is exactly the same as for installing 64 bit Windows 7. I have no way of verifying if is this is also true for your Mac mini.\n\nI thought I used the procedure given in the comments below to run the BCSS on the 2011 iMac with 64 bit Windows 10 installed. Now that I think about it, I may not of had to.\n\nEventually, the BCSS is released in sets of versions. As far as I can tell, only version sets 4, 5 and 6 can be downloaded from an Apple web site and/or through the Boot Camp Assistant. Older sets exist on the Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) or older DVDs. Some (if not all) of the version 4 BCSS downloads contain a Bootcamp64.msi file. I know this to be true for 4.0.4033 and 4.0.4255. Most (if not all) of the version 5 BCSS downloads do not contain a Bootcamp64.msi file. I know this to be true for 5.1.5621 and 5.1.5640. The version 6 set is irrelevant, since Apple does not officially support Windows 10 on 2011 Macs.\n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that you are using the wrong BCSS.\n\nYou should probably install El Capitan (OS X 10.11) and download the BCSS using the Boot Camp Assistant. Or at least, you should be download \"Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621\".\n\nA: Easiest answer should be to power on your Mac, hold down the Option Key and let the Startup Manager populate itself with your bootable volumes.\nHighlight the Windows volume and hold the Control Key down, you should note the icon changes to an arrow going around in a circle, while still holding Control down press Enter.\nCongratulations, you have now set the default startup volume to be that volume.\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20080919150504866\n\nA: If you can access recovery mode by holding down Command + R when you boot into your machine, you should be able to press the apple icon in to top left hand corner of the screen and select start up disk and then choose your startup disk.\n\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: Mounted drive does not show up on Disk Utility, Desktop, Finder Sidebar I've an external drive that consists of 2 partitions, one NTFS that I use for storing stuff and one Journaled that I use for TimeMachine.\nI've connected the drive to my Mac but now the NTFS partition is not showing up on the desktop, finder sidebar or disk util app, while the TimeMachine partition does.\nI though that the NTFS partition wasn't being mounted but if I go to /Volumes it's there and I can in fact browse the drive, open the stuff that's saved there and also save new stuff, so the drive is working fine, it's just not showing up where it should..\nIt even works and shows up on the Terminal when executing the diskutil list command, and I can diskutil unmount disk3s2 and diskutil mount disk3s2 without issues.\nWhat do I need to do for the partition to show on the aforementioned places?\n\nA: A simple restart fixed the issue for some reason.\n", "Q: Replaced SSD drive on MBPr shown as External I replaced my internal MBPr SSD for an OCW Aura one.\nIt works great, but it's recognised as \"External\" (despite being installed internally), which means it shows up on Finder/Desktop as an external drive, and it even has the Eject button shown.\nFrom a quick glance on the System Report, the issue should be that it's marked as \"Removable Media: Yes\". Any way to change that and have OS X see it properly as an internal drive?\nI'm running the latest El Capitan version btw, and the drive is an OCW Aura 480.\n\nA: Yes, having had the same issue myself you need to erase and setup the drive again from scratch. It comes from the factory setup as you describe for whatever reason.\nAfter backing up all your data (or if you already have a good backup or don't need one), follow these instructions:\nPower off your Mac.

The issue I ran into was that Windows 10 simply would not finish the installation after installing the OWC Aura 1TB SSD (PCI). It would stall at various % of \"Getting files ready for installation\" step. Nothing I tried worked.\nWhat I ended up doing was taking an acronis trueimage 2017 clone of all of my disks. The important step is to make sure you have a valid recovery partition on OSX. This is very important because of the way that I got the disk set up. Once the acronis backup is finished, I set up an acronis universal boot media in OSX. This USB was vital. Once finished, I rebooted my MBPr. And booted from the universal boot media (acronis) and let acronis clone the backup to the new 1TB Aura. Once that was complete, I was able to boot perfectly into both OSX and Windows. \nI still had the External disk issue though. In OSX I got the driver from OWC for 'bootcamp' here: OWC Support Drivers Download\nChoose the correct one for you (Aura SSD for Mid-2013 and Later MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with Retina display). Then, install it in OSX. Upon rebooting, Disk Utility now displayed the OWC Aura SSD Media as \"960.04 GB PCI Internal Physical Disk\" where before it was always external. There is one remaining issue, that is, that I cannot get System Report to correctly show the disk as NOT removable. It seems theres a removable bit that I cannot figure out how to flip to false.\nNB: I tried BootIt from Lexar in windows. It works fine in windows but for some reason has no effect on OSX.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: My iPhone 5s shuts down when it has remaining battery My iPhone 5s was shutting down automatically when it had 80% percent battery. Yesterday I restored it with iTunes and compatible firmware (6.1), now it shuts down at 73% battery.\nWhat is the problem and how I can solve that?\n\nA: You have essentially eliminated software as a cause by restoring the OS. If it happens consistently around the same percentage remaining, you likely have bad cells in the battery. Batteries cannot be repaired, so you must either have it replaced at an Apple Store or authorized repair center, or consider ordering parts and tools and doing it yourself if you have some technical proficiency (e.g., https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+5s+Battery+Replacement/19239).\n\nA: I had the same issue before. Most likely your iPhone's battery isn't calibrated correctly. Try to calibrate it. If the problem persists, then you have a bad battery, it's time to visit the Apple Store. \n", "Q: How to contact a user who wrote a review to my app? I have published an app in the App Store. Now one of the customers/buyer wrote a review regarding a technical issue. \nHow can I contact that person? In the review I can only see the author's pseudonym. \n\nA: Since a few days, you now have the ability to answer to reviews, right from iTunes Connect.\nGo to My Apps > YourApp > Activity > Reviews and you will be able to click on Answer for each review. \nYour answers will be available directly from the App Store for people running on iOS 10.3, and I think the reviewer also receive a mail or notification that you answered.\nIt a huge step from Apple to finally offer this !\n\n\nA: It's not possible. If you wish to help users you could list an email adress in your app and/or let them immediately email to it. Apple does not allow you to reply to user reviews in the app store. \n", "Q: Can't update to Windows 10 on MacBook Pro due to Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth I've followed the instructions here : https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204990\nI have a late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina. Currently running Windows 7 64bit. I've got the latest OS X 10.11 El Capitan, all software updates applied. I've run the Apple Software Update in Windows 7 - all up to date.\nWhen I click on the Get Windows 10 icon, it displays:\n\n\"Unfortunately, this PC is unable to run Windows 10... because one or more things are incompatible.\n\nViewing the report, it says:\n\n\"The device manufacturers haven't made these devices compatible with Windows 10, so they won't work. Check with the manufacturers for support.\"\nApple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth\nApple Inc.\n\n\nA: Try updating the bluetooth driver using the one found here: http://support.lenovo.com/au/en/downloads/ds031759\nIt should have the supported Windows 10 driver for the Bluetooth chipset found in that model (BCM20702).\nOnce completed, try the upgrade again.\n\nA: I ended up going in to Windows Update and it showed Windows 10 as the main update option with a 'Get Started' button. Clicked that and it all worked just fine.\nNo need to fiddle around any more trying to please the 'Get Windows 10' icon.\n\nA: Seem like you have to install Windows 10 manually with iso file and bootcamp, then install the driver.\n", "Q: MacBook taking long time to load the boot loader; rEFInd freezes I have a MacBook Pro 2015 and I am dual booting with Linux. I use rEFInd and since day 1 it has been working fine on most occasions. Sometimes it would take a long time to show its screen and then it would freeze, updating every 5-10 seconds (so if I press down on my keyboard twice, it would jump two entries down in a few seconds). In those cases I would clear the PRAM/NVRAM, re-bless rEFInd and it will be ok. Recently however it happened again and this time resetting PRAM/NVRAM does not help. Furthermore, under Linux no input devices work (neither internal, nor USB keyboard). lshw lists them as working and with a loaded kernel module for them... Internal keyboard works under OS X.\nEDIT: The reason I think it may be a hardware problem Related to the issue is that loading the bootloader (whether it is rEFInd after I bless it, or the native Apple bootloader as soon as I clear PRAM) takes about 20 seconds after the start up chime, which is not normal. I noticed that after I reset PRAM, I hear the start up chime, only 3 seconds later I see the Apple logo (boot is fast) and on the very next reboot, it hangs somewhere, which now leads me to believe that maybe some of my OS X settings which also modify the PRAM are corrupted and corrupt the PRAM. Is there a way to prevent OS X from modifying the PRAM in ANY way?\nI'd hate to take it to a service, since they'll tell me \"20 seconds is not long and we don't deal with 3rd party loaders\", but I know it never used to take more than 3 seconds to show the Apple logo, so something must have changed. Ideas?\nP.S. I use Gentoo, whose kernel is perfectly capable of being booted directly from the UEFI firmware and there are instructions on how to do this using efibootmgr but they are not specifically for Macs and I've read in some places that efibootmgr may/will brick the firmware on Macs so I am reluctant to try...\n\nA: I'm assuming you're dealing with a Retina MacBook Pro.\nIf your Mac is taking that long to find something to boot and then also taking forever to boot afterwards then you may potentially have faulty storage.\nYes they probably will baulk at the 3rd party boot loader but as long as you have a backup you'll be OK. The Apple Store will run hardware tests to confirm whether or not the storage is faulty as well as reload the current version of OS X after wiping your storage.\nIt's part of their testing so if they can't load OS X cleanly then it's definitely a hardware issue.\nYou can find your local contact number here: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201232\nOn that note, why not just try cleanly installing OS X yourself after erasing your storage?\nSee http://osxdaily.com/2014/12/14/reinstall-os-x-mac-internet-recovery/\nIf you can do that successfully then you're just looking at an issue with rEFInd and/or your Linux partition (by the way why not just get Linux booting natively through EFI without the extra boot loader? http://heeris.id.au/2014/ubuntu-plus-mac-pure-efi-boot-short-version/)\n\nA: Edit: sorry I just realized this is a 1 year old thead\nI was exactly in the same boat as you. All the symptoms matches.\nFor me it got fixed by updating the mac firmware. I went into macos downloaded all the updates, rebooted back to macos to ensure all the updates are installed and then the problem got fixed.\nI got the idea from\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mac#Firmware_updates\nI don't know what the root cause was, but it got fixed after updating mac firmware. It has been working fine for 3 days, not sure if it got fixed permanently.\n", "Q: How to connect Smart TV to Time Capsule? I want to be able to copy movies on a Time Capsule and watch them on my Smart TV (Philips 32PFH5500) without the computer on. \nHow can I set this up?\n\nA: Time Capsule shares files via SMB protocol, so if your TV can connect to a networ share, you are good to go.\nIf your TV cannot do that, you'd have to jailbreak the TC since it doesn't allow running apps or media streaming code out of the box.\n", "Q: Arrow cursor hotspot off by a few pixels On my MacBook Pro i have realised that the default mouse cursor (black arrow) has its hotspot a few pixels off the top left corner. It becomes obvious if I move the cursor slowly to a button in the browser. While the tip of the arrow is already like 3 or 4 pixels in the button it does not highlight it yet. When I move it one pixel further the cursor turns to the hand cursor and the tip of the finger is exactly on the edge of the button.\nIs this on purpose? Can I change that somewhere? \n\nA: After closer inspection I figured out that the white border of the arrow cursor is not considered part of the cursor, only the black part is, then it seems pixel perfect. It is very confusing to me but I guess its working as intended.\n", "Q: Pages app in trash Having tried to create and then delete a folder in Pages I now find that if I try to open Pages from the dock I get a message: \"You can’t open the application “Pages” because it is in the Trash. To open this application, move it from the Trash.\"\nHowever I don't see it listed in trash. I can still open Pages from the launchpad. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: *\n\n*Close Pages (quit)\n\n*Remove the Pages shortcut from the dock\n\n*Open Pages from the launchpad or from Spotlight\n\n*Once Pages opens, click on the dock icon and choose options, then keep in dock.\n\n", "Q: Getting exchange password from keychain Is there a way using security find-internet-password or something similar to get my exchange credentials on the command line?  I'm trying to write a script to auto-login into an exchange server and I'm sure the data exists somewhere but just unsure how to grab it.\n\nA: security find-generic-password -ga <account>\n\nYou can find the account by opening Keychain Access, opening the application password (titled Exchange) and looking at the Account field. It should be in the form emailaddress@server e.g. ‘username@example.com@mail.example.com’.\nUpon running this command, you will be prompted to allow access to the item in your Keychain, upon which you can Allow or Always Allow.\nThe password is printed in the last line of the output:\n…\npassword: \"abc123\"\n\n", "Q: How to use iTerm along with the default bash terminal? I want to use iTerm with my default bash terminal because there is a lot of customization that i have done to my .bash_profile and I don't want to lose it or perform all the hard work again.\n\nA: You are mixing up a couple of things here. Note there is no such thing as bash terminal.\niTerm and Terminal are applications that start up a defined program - by default it is /usr/bin/login. This program starts a shell (listed in /etc/shells) by default this is /bin/bash.\nbash reads ~/.bash_profile if it is started by login (or with a -l parameter), bash does not care if it is started by iTerm or Terminal. (There might be environment variables set depending on what starts bash e.g. ITERM_* from iTerm and TERM_PROGRAM by both)\niTerm and Terminal store their defaults in different places (both within ~/Library/Preferences) and do not write to ~/.bash* files.\nThus your ~/.bash_profile will be run by both iTerm and Terminal and will not be affected by them except if you test on certain variables\n", "Q: How to delete all photos from iPhone using mac or pc I'd like to delete all of the photos and videos from my iPhone 5S. I am willing to use [free] software on a mac or PC. Image Capture on a Mac does not have a delete option, before or after import. I imported all of the images and it did not offer any way to delete them from the iPhone. And, the instructions at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3075727?tstart=0 do not work for me since there is no delete icon visible.\nOn the PC side, the windows explorer delete function gives an error when I try to delete.\nIs there an iPhone setting I need to change in order to make them deletable? Does this have to do with iCloud at all?\n\nA: I found out that if you disable iCloud photo syncing, then Image Capture will allow you to delete your photos.\nGo to Settings > iCloud > Photos and turn off \"iCloud Photo Library\". Then, close image capture, disconnect your iPhone from your Mac, and reconnect the iPhone. Then Image Capture will show the delete icon.\n", "Q: Dock won't appear on other displays I know, you can't have the dock on both screens at the same time, and I know that there's a 'swipe down' gesture I'm supposed to be able to do with the mouse to make the dock appear.

I've done this before on other computers. \nMac OS X El Capitan (10.11) clean install done yesterday.\n\nA: You can also fix the dock on a other screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences\n\n*Click on Displays\n\n*Click on Arrangement\n\n*Swipe the white bar from one screen to the other\n\n\nIf this won't work, also check the alt + cmd + d keycombination to show / hide the dock.\n", "Q: Bind Volume controls to non-Apple keyboard without 3rd party software on macOS Sierra All the software I could find that does this is broken on macOS Sierra and will probably break again in the future, so I need a solution to set the system volume in the same increments as the volume keys without needing a 3rd party app running.\nIf my understanding is correct, keyboards with generic media controls work without software, if I could rebind my PrintScr and Scroll Lock keys as volume up/down that would be ideal.\n(I'm using a fullsize Majestouch 2 with ANSI layout.)\nIf that isn't possible, any Service or other Workaround is welcome. I can actually work without the bezel as long as the increments are the same.\nKarabiner was one of the apps I used before, it doesn't work either and isn't likely to be fixed soon: macOS (10.12) compatibility #660\n\nA: Karabiner has options that let you use the Function keys (with or without ‘fn’) on external non-Apple keyboards just like the special function keys on Apple keyboards. This means pressing F11 and F12 (‘fn’ depends on your options shown in the screenshot) to decrease and increase volume. The HUD shows as usual, and F10 works for mute too.\n\nI am yet to see Karabiner fail to function due to an OS update, even day-one beta OS updates seem no trouble for these ‘standard’ features of the app (there's more customisable functionality which may have problems from OS updates but are fixed swiftly).\n\nA: Keyboard Maestro\nworks with macOS Sierra. It will let you do exactly what you want, it's a great alternative when Karabiner doesn't work yet. By the way, you can use Karabiner Elements instead of Karabiner, but without GUI it may be troublesome for most users.\n", "Q: iOS 10 public beta infinite loop So I tried signing up for Apple beta program where I use Safari on my iPhone 6 and go to beta.apple.com and tap sign up. I'm then taken to the login page, and just after that to the legal page where I accept the terms of Apple beta program. This is where it falls apart and instead of redirection to the beta profile download page I get redirected back to beta welcome page where I can sign up again, accept the agreement again and than be sent right back to welcome page, thus creating an infinite loop.\nThings I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting old iOS 9 beta profile and rebooting\n\n*Reverting back to non beta iOS 9.3.2\n\n*Restoring my iPhone to factory defaults\n\n*Leaving and signing back up for beta\n\n*Trying beta.apple.com/profile directly, but again result is an infinite loop\n\n*Searching Apple and Apple oriented sites for a solution\n\n*Sacrificing a goat\n\n\nBasically nothing works for me, and visiting beta.apple.com on any browser, desktop or mobile is resulting in the same annoying behavior. \n\nA: I had the same problem..

I own a 2007 Macbook running Mac OS X Lion, a 2009 iMac running Mac OS X Yosemite and an iPad Mini 2/iPhone 6 Plus both running iOS 9. None of my burst photos will import using Image Capture or Photos. In fact, Image Capture and Photos don't even recognize them at all. I have over 1,000 images in my camera roll. Over half of them are individual photos that were once part of bursts. Yet, Image Capture and Photos only see around 300 photos in my camera roll, which are photos that were shot individually and were never part of a burst. Even when I go into my burst photos and select each photo within every burst so that they're showing in my camera roll as individual photos, none of them import. How can I import and backup all of my burst photos?\nPlease Note: This has been an ongoing issue for me ever since burst photos were first introduced.\nUnfortunately, the below answer does not answer my question. All of the photos have already been separated from bursts by \"selecting\" each photo within each burst and also marked as favorites. They are all listed individually in my camera roll. Still, they are not being recognized by Image Capture and Photos. I need to know what to do so that they'll be recognized by Image Capture and Photos so that I can import them. Just to be clear, this is the problem that I am having: All of the photos from bursts are all present in my camera roll as individual photos, but they're not being recognized by Image Capture and Photos on my iMac, so they will not import.\n\nA: No matter which burst photo,\nuntil it isn't marked as 'Favorite' , it doesn't get to the actual 'Camera Roll'.\nSo,\nMark those photos as 'Favorite'. Then, try connecting your iOS Device to your Mac. Now, the 'Image Capture' app should open automatically. [If it didn't, check the cable connection(USB<->iOS Device) or manually open the app.\nIf you're not sure the problem is the wire(cable), see if the iOS device is being charged(of course this happens if you have turned on USB Charging in Settings).]\nAlso, there's a 3rd-party app named iExplorer  which can help you in many ways. I recommend this app, but I'm not responsible for any further problems within your Macs or iOS devices.\nAs the iPhone User Guide (By Apple, available on the iBooks Store for free) suggests:\n\nTake rapid-fire shots: (iPhone 5s) Touch and hold the shutter button to take photos in burst mode. The counter shows how many shots you’ve taken, until you lift your finger. To see the suggested shots and select the photos you want to keep, tap the thumbnail, then tap “Favorites.” The gray dot(s) mark the suggested photos. To copy a photo from the burst as a separate photo in Camera Roll, tap the circle on the lower-right corner. To delete the burst of photos, tap it, then tap . \n\n", "Q: How to upcycle a 10-year old iMac (display)? There’s a lot of close-to-duplicate questions around here asking how to connect some computer (often laptop) with an iMac to reuse its larger display as a second monitor. Depending on the ports available and exact model number, there are frequently cited solutions like Target Display Mode, VNC Screen Sharing, Remote Desktop, Screen Recycler, Air Display or Air Play. They all require the iMac to run an operating system, though. \nWhat if some component of the old iMac (32-bit Intel model from 2006, limited to OS X 10.6.8) was broken, say the hard drive, so it won’t boot up and it would be okay to take it apart. \nI'd like to keep at least the display, power supply and casing, maybe solder on some connectors or add some alternate cables, which shouldn’t cost too much. Anything else could stay inside unless it needlessly consumed energy.\nWhat would it take to reclaim the still functioning display?\n\nA: There is an I Fix It Guide which describes the steps and hardware necessary. @Allan is right, though, in that it may not be worth it except for the fun of fixing stuff. This first Intel iMac can also be ugraded to a 64bit CPU with 4 GB of RAM and a SSD without a lot of efforts or costs.\n", "Q: In multi-monitor setup, how to control which workspace a newly launched app appears in? I have a MacBook Pro (OS X 10.11)  with one HDMI monitor and one USB monitor. The MBP is on the left, HDMI in the middle, and the USB is on the right. Each monitor has ~3 workspaces (meaning I usually have a total of 9 workspaces).\nMy overall setup seems chaos with regard to on which monitor, and in which workspace, apps launch into. I launch apps via the Dock and Finder.\nExample: On the USB monitor in workspace #8, I double clicked a .docx file in Finder. At the time, I had workspace #1 displayed on the MBP. The MBP monitor all the sudden flipped to workspace #2 and opened the document.\nLikewise, launching apps from the Dock gives inconsistent results. \nNote:   The behavior that is most logical does happen when you start Launch Pad and System Preferences from the Dock.  \n\n\n*\n\n*put mouse focus in the monitor and workspace you want.  \n\n*click on the Dock for Launch Pad or System Preferences.  \n\n*they launch in the monitor and workspace that has the current focus.  \n\n\nFor apps like Chrome, Excel, NetBeans, iTunes, etc. that does not happen. I can't figure-out how OS X decides which workspace to put it in.\n\nA: Problem solved! Let's say that I was not that familiar with apps that were running but had no open windows. Along with that I'd never paid much mind to my Dock (I always hid it with the Genie Effect). And the fbara comment sealed my understanding.\nnote: When I was messing around with the options settings for apps on the Dock, a few times I was given the choice of selecting both a default monitor and workspace. I am not sure what I did though. I can't get that choice anymore. \n", "Q: Keep dual screen active with MBP and iMac, after hibernation/sleep I have an older iMac (2009) as a second monitor for a MacbookPro (2015). Both are running El Capitan. By hooking up a thunderbolt cable I can activate the second monitor feature using Cmd+F2 just fine. I only have one (wired) keyboard, so once activated I pull out the plug from the iMac into the MBP. \nHowever, a couple of times a day I leave my system and it'll go into energy saving or hibernation. Afterwards, the dual monitor link is broken. I have to switch the keyboard from MBP => iMac, press Cmd+F2 and replug the cable back into the MBP.\nIt's kind of a nuisance really. Is there a neat way to prevent the \"link\" from breaking when the system goes to sleep?\nOf course I'm not really interested in disabling sleep mode entirely, nor using a tool like caffeine for this purpose. \n\nA: You are probably best served by this app here:\nhttps://github.com/duanefields/VirtualKVM\nDownload here: https://github.com/duanefields/VirtualKVM/releases\nBasically \"Automatically toggles Bluetooth and Target Display Mode when you connect a Macbook to your iMac via Thunderbolt.\"\n", "Q: Unable to recover disk space Mac OS X EI Capitan I deleted one partition on my mac and now I am not able to recover that space.  diskutil list shows below output.

I am not sure if the sudo prefix is required.\n\nIn your case, '/dev/disk0s2' and '/dev/disk0s3' are already at the bottom of 'disk0', therefore the above command will not work.\n\nFortunately, you should have enough space to clone your existing HFS+ formatted OS X volume labeled \"Yosemite\". You then can merge the partitions to recover all the lost space. The procedure is given below. To aid in understanding the steps, I preformed the procedure on a Sparse Disk Image. What you will encounter will differ slightly from the posted images. You will need to make the appropriate substitutions.\nYou will need to boot the Mac from either another drive or from OS X Internet Recovery.

I had prepared a USB flash drive a while ago and in order for it to work I had to erase the partition the OS was on. I had been doing Time Machine backups regularly and before erasing the hard drive I copied the Users, Library and Applications folders to an external hard drive. Now I have a clean copy of 10.10.5 installed and transferring some of the files wouldn't work out because of the different operating systems.

Now I need to access the website created in VirtualBox in iMac. can any one guide me please?\n\nA: It is too easy. Firstly you just need to set the virtual machine to use bridged networking, so it will get an IP address on your network. This IP address will be accessible from your host machine.\nAccording to the Chapter 6 of VirtualBox's manual:\nWith bridged networking, VirtualBox uses a device driver on your host system that filters data from your physical network adapter. This driver is therefore called a \"net filter\" driver. This allows VirtualBox to intercept data from the physical network and inject data into it, effectively creating a new network interface in software. When a guest is using such a new software interface, it looks to the host system as though the guest were physically connected to the interface using a network cable: the host can send data to the guest through that interface and receive data from it. This means that you can set up routing or bridging between the guest and the rest of your network.\nYou can also use the NAT networking mode, but you have to work a lot to set the port tinkering. \n", "Q: iPhone auto-power-off after power disconnection I have an old iPhone 4s that I use as a music player in the car.  It is plugged into a cigar-lighter socket that is only powered when the ignition is on.  The phone's battery life is not particularly good anymore, so after turning off the ignition, the phone, if left as is (powered on), will deplete its battery in a few hours.  Next time I get into the car and turn it on, the phone will be completely dead and have to charge for 10-20 minutes before I can power it up and start playing music.\nHowever, if I remember to power off the phone when I turn off the car, the phone battery will generally be good until the next time I turn on the car.  When I turn it on, the phone will start receiving power again and automatically turn on.\nInstead of having to remember to manually turn off the phone when I turn off the car, is there some way I can have the phone automatically power off when it is no longer receiving power?  Ideally it would wait for 10-20 minutes before powering off (if I stop for gas or something), but immediate power-off would be OK too.\nI have looked for settings and apps that could possibly do this, but so far haven't found anything.\n\nFWIW I do also have a cigar-lighter socket that is always on, regardless of ignition state.  I could possibly plug the phone in there instead, but I got wary of that - last winter my car battery was a bit weak and I left the phone plugged in like this for perhaps 3 or 4 days without starting the car, and it ran the car battery right down.  I have a new car battery now, but I'd still rather avoid having this continuous drain on it.\n\nA: Without jailbreaking, this is not possible as Apple does not provide a feature for this, and apps can't control the system in this manner.\nIf the device is jailbroken, you can use an Activator action to Power Down on Disconnect.\n\n\n", "Q: How to transfer information on a shared iCloud account to a new individual one?

I am leaving for a vacation and leaving my rMBP. How should I store it except from shutting it down? How much charge should I leave in order not to lose too much capacity?\n\nA: You are overthinking this as there is nothing special about the lithium battery that requires special storage considerations.  Just store it like you normally would; I put mine on a bookshelf to hide it from the inevitable human curiosity of the dog walker/plant waterer when I go on extended trips.\nYour lithium ion battery is going to lose capacity whether you use it or not because the biggest factor in the longevity of a battery is age not how much it's charged.  Now, the amount that it loses over the month is going to be negligible; you won't even notice.\nI posted an answer that is relevant to this question:  MATH FINDS TOP CULPRIT AS LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES AGE\nJust leave it plugged in over the month and you will be fine.\n\nA: Doesn't matter what % charge you leave it at. You won't lose too much charging capacity any way you do it. Just be sure to fully shut it down and store it in a cool (not cold) dark place.\n\nA: To quote directly from Apple about their own products and batteries:\n\"Store it half-charged when you store it long term.\nIf you want to store your device long term, two key factors will affect the overall health of your battery: the environmental temperature and the percentage of charge on the battery when it’s powered down for storage. Therefore, we recommend the following:\nDo not fully charge or fully discharge your device’s battery — charge it to around 50 per cent. If you store a device when its battery is fully discharged, the battery could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding a charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life.\nPower down the device to avoid additional battery use.\nPlace your device in a cool, moisture-free environment that’s less than 32° C (90° F).\nIf you plan to store your device for longer than six months, charge it to 50 per cent every six months.\nDepending on how long you store your device, it may be in a low-battery state when you remove it from long-term storage. After it’s removed from storage, it may require 20 minutes of charging with the original adapter before you can use it.\"\nSee: http://www.apple.com/au/batteries/maximizing-performance/ as well as https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204054 for further information on batteries in Apple products.\n", "Q: How to sync an iBooks collection created on my iPad?

It's very disruptive and makes it very difficult to complete even simple tasks. You may have a defective digitizer or loose connector. Has your phone recently experienced any drops or hard impacts? Your best bet is to visit an Apple store and have the screen/digitizer replaced. \n\nA: I've seen that issue before.

We are a small organization and she was alone looking after Windows and Mac Servers. We have tried to secure the network by changing the firewall password and disabling her Windows account. \nMy question here is more about securing our Mac server. She built The Mac server on a Mac Mini running OS X 10.11 and we use it to enroll Mac devices and push apps via profile manager. \nNow the challenge is I have never used Macs before and I don't have have any experience of managing or administering server. I tried to secure the Mac server by changing her account password which she gave before leaving. I don't want to disable her account on mac mini because there were loads of passwords saved in her keychain which we don't know and right now we are using the saved passwords. \nCould anyone please guide me how can we secure our Mac server in case any sabotage attempt is made by her since she can still access our server via iCloud and can remotely wipe the server. \n\nA: There's basically two things you need to do to secure your Mac from a (involuntarily) separated employee:\n\n*\n\n*Secure from outside access\n\n*Change all passwords\n\nThis is an overlapping approach because neither are 100% foolproof.  However, if you remove as many of the access paths from outside the organization, whatever is missed will be covered by the changed account credentials; and vice versa.\nSecure from Outside Access\nIt sounds like you have the Admin credentials required to change/lock out her account and from accessing the firewall.  So, what you need to check is:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud and AppleID.  Get these changed right away.\n\n*Any open ports on the firewall like SSH and VNC.  You don't need a password for these as she can \"tunnel\" right through. (You will also want to close of Windows RDP (Remote Desktop, port 3389) since you said you had Windows servers.\n\n*Turn off SSH and VNC on the Mac Mini for the time being until you can get everything locked down\n\n*Remote control software should be removed/disabled (TeamViewer, GoToMyPC, LogMeIn, etc)\n\nChange all Passwords\nThis one comes down to how \"malicious\" you think this person is or can be.  You disabled her password, but did she have other accounts or know other people's passwords?\nI run into this scenario all the time, small business customers tend to do things that larger organizations have policies against.  For example, someone may be having an issue with their device and instead of remoting in, they will bring their laptop and when asked for the password by the Computer Admin, the user will write it down.\nIt happens because there is a higher level of trust in a smaller organization.  It's usually not a problem until you have to fire the Computer Admin.  That's just one example.\nIf you believe the person is malicious enough to do something, have all passwords changed.\nFinally, as someone who does this for a living, I can't tell you how important it is to hire an outside consultant who can help mitigate these risks for you.  This is a 3rd party, impartial person (company) who has a financial stake in securing your IT assets will (and should) have the same access as your admin(s).  This way, should something happen, there is a person you can call that is familiar with your network and has the expertise to keep you running.\nBest of all, a signed contract (SLA - Service Level Agreement) between you and a vendor is a wonderful thing for end user;  they hold up very well in court.\n\nA: Did she use an iCloud account registered to your company or to her personally? Admin accounts that require an email address to set up (like iCloud) should be using a corporate address like \"admin@company.com\" and not an address tied to a specific user. This means that when the user leaves, a replacement will be able to use the same account without having to re-register everything. A corporate email should be used as the recovery contact email as well, so an admin leaving under less than optimal conditions cannot maliciously restore access to themselves or reset passwords (or, with iCloud, remotely wipe a system!). Even in my use case (where \"admin\" emails are for controlling access to shared computers in a lab, or web administration for a small nonprofit group) no one's personal email is used for any of the registrations - it's all handled by a dedicated account linked to the group.\nYou really should also invest in a password manager too, something aside from Keychain, with a master password that is known to the IT manager and senior leadership, to ensure that access is not lost during staff turnover. Get the passwords out of Keychain and copy them into the password manager. Use something like 1Password that can store the password archive on the local network, not just in the cloud.\n\nA: Safest thing to do would be to log that user out of iCloud entirely (http://appsliced.co/ask/how-do-i-log-out-of-icloud-on-my-mac)\nMake sure you choose \"Keep on Mac\" when it asks if you want to retain the data from the iCloud accounts various features.\n\nA: Profile Manager needs an Apple ID to push profiles to devices, so you need to go into the Server application and configure profile manager with a different Apple ID (Dr. Nixon's advice will be helpful here), by going to the settings tab in the first pane that comes up (the one named for your server). Look for the \"Apple Push Notification\" checkbox, and select the \"Edit Apple ID\" button.\nThat should allow Profile Manager to keep working. Applications remain purchased so you can still use them, but they may not update w/o the purchaser's Apple ID.\nThe password for the directory admin (for Open Directory, which was set up as part of Profile Manager) might be a more tricky issue. As Allan said, your best bet is to hire someone experienced to clean up the situation. \n", "Q: Is it possible to output different audio to HDMI and built-in speaker simultaneously?

If you continue to have problems, contact your system administrator\n\nI'm using OS X 10.11.5.\n\nA: So you should know that AFP is deprecated as of 10.11 and SMB should always be used where possible.\nThe next OS X (10.12) will drop AFP support entirely.\nBesides that, Given that the log is suggesting the kernel extension for AFPFS is unable to load due to missing dependencies you may want to look at either reinstalling the 10.11.5 Combo Update or reinstalling the whole OS over the top.\nCombo Update can be grabbed here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL1876?viewlocale=en_AU&locale=en_AU\nFor the reinstall, make sure you have a known good backup with time machine or similar.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201250\nRe-Install El Capitan by going to the App Store, search for it, download it and install once completed. It will install 10.11.5.\n", "Q: OS X randomly asking for NAS login after using mount_afp on Terminal This is a very weird issue that is apparently so rare Google hasn't been any help in finding a clue as to why this happens or how to fix it.\nI use mount_afp on Terminal to mount the music directory of my NAS into my user's home directory because my music library is too big to store it locally in its entirety. It is not permanently mounted whenever I use my MacBook and I don't always mount it after a reboot, only when I actually need my music library or want to start up iTunes.\nI would use a command as follows: mount_afp afp://username:password@my_nas/Multimedia/[userdir]/Music ~/Music to mount the music directory of my NAS directly into the Music directory of my home directory (so iTunes can use its default paths and everything)\n\n(I also get asked when I'm not in my home network)\nNow, whenever I open the Photos app on my MacBook when the music directory isn't mounted the system keeps asking me to log into my NAS twice in a row and again two times after some time passes. As of recent, the issue is no more just restricted to the Photos app, it's asking me in random parts of the system to enter my NAS credentials. I can only assume it is somehow connected to me using mount_afp on Terminal to mount the Music directory of my NAS directly into my home directory when I want to listen to music via iTunes or Sync my iPhone. I'm assuming something wants to access parts of my home directory that the system is aware is on my NAS and asking me to login.\nI don't understand why it's asking me to log into my NAS because the photo library is actually stored locally and iCloud sync is on and when the NAS isn't mounted it should fall back to the default Music directory which is empty on my hard drive.\nSince OS X is UNIX based I thought mount_afp set a mount point in /etc/fstab or something but the file was empty and included a note not to edit it.\nSomewhere the system has to record where to go in order to poll my NAS on its own. Since I also tried a complete reinstall of OS X the strange behavior was gone but it came back right when I used mount_afp again. Permanently mounting it is not feasible as I take my MacBook with me a lot when I'm out and about.\nI'm out of ideas.\n\nA: Might want to check /etc/auto_afp for your mount point and remove if present.\nSounds like your Mac is constantly trying (and retrying) to automatically mount that share unsuccessfully.\nTry moving to using autofs so you don't need to manually deal with mounting your share and it should be seamlessly unmounting that share when you change networks: http://blog.grapii.com/2015/06/keep-network-drives-mounted-on-mac-os-x-using-autofs/\nAs for Photos requesting you mount your AFP share despite the Photos Library being stored locally I also don't have a clue there.\nMaybe changing how its mounted as suggested may resolve your issue? I'll try and recreate your environment here and let you know if I have the same problem (with a possible solution).\n\nA: After much trial and error I finally found the cause of the issue:\nI deleted the iTunes folder on my local file system and in doing so OS X kept trying to go for iTunes folder on the NAS because that was the only library it knew. I needed to let iTunes create an empty library on my local file system first before mounting the /Music folder on my NAS over the local ~/Music folder.\nIf the NAS is not mounted it will now go for the local (empty) iTunes library and the prompts stop.\n", "Q: Cursor freezes for a split second around every 10 seconds My cursor on my Mac (running the latest version of El Capitan) has been freezing for a split second around every 10 seconds – it then reappears in the place it should've been if it hadn't disappeared.\nI've tried using a different mouse – still occurs. And have done a PRAM reset.\nAnyone have a clue of what could fix this?\n\nA: I've had that happen to my own Mac and typically for me it was due to a high system load or something else locking the system (like a hard drive failing for example).\nHere is a comprehensive list of things to try:\nTry leaving Activity Monitor open and check if CPU usage remains consistently high while you are doing your usual tasks.\nIf so, close all running Applications and check again.\nAlso, with all your normal applications open check the Memory tab and see if Memory Used is close to or exceeding Physical Memory. If so, perhaps see if your Mac can have its Memory upgraded?\nAlso, Go to the Disk tab and check Data written/sec: If you're looking at 50 MB/s or above and your Mac does not have an SSD then that's most likely the issue. You can also get this upgraded on most Macs.\nYou can also try loading your Mac into Safe Boot Mode to force the Mac to check and fix its startup volume from any issues it may have (https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201262). Once you have done this and are in Safe Boot mode, reboot the Mac and try using it normally again, see if the issue is resolved.\nCheck your hard drive's health using a tool such as Drive Genius, disclaimer: I do not work for them but only recommend their tool as its quite easy to use and understand.\nIf your hard drive's health isn't great then you should backup your data with Time Machine (https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201250) and take your Mac to an Apple Store or Authorised Repairer for servicing so they can replace your hard drive.\nTry creating yourself a new user account to test in, if you find the cursor is not skipping in the new account it may be an issue with your user account.\nOnce you have a good backup you can also try restoring your system to a clean state and re-test without your restoring your data on the Mac. If you find that the cursor isn't skipping then the issue may be due to an Application previously installed on your Mac or a corrupt system file.\nTry restoring just your user account using Migration Assistant once your Mac is in a clean state and you have confirmed the cursor issue is not present\n\nA: I've had something like this issue (with the mouse freezing momentarily every few seconds), and it was related to my second screen. If I left this second screen turned off after waking the Mac from sleep (or from having the laptop lid closed), this issue happened every time\nAlso had an issue with it even when the screen was on; it usually cleared after I unplugged and replugged the second screen cable.\n\nA: I had this difficulty with a brand new MacBook Pro (2018).  I found the stuttering was connected to my use of a USB-C breakout box I had attached.  Even if other accessories were not attached to the box, it caused a momentary stutter every ten seconds.  After removing it, all was well\n\nA: I've had this issue for quite some time and for the life of me couldn't have thought it was due to my second monitor. I used to connect my second monitor and I regularly switch it off if I feel I don't use it, but still leave it connected. Finally, I figured that as long as I keep the second monitor switched off, the mouse/trackpad used to freeze at frequent intervals. Switch the monitor on, and the problem is gone. Basically, didn't need to unplug and replug the monitor cable at all. Just switching the 2nd monitor on worked for me. Weird, I know. \n\nA: Was happening with mine too.  So I disconnected my second screen, and the problem ceased.  Reconnected, and it's okay now.\n\nA: My cursor was also freezing intermittently and it was also related to my multi-screen display. I unplugged my monitors and replugged them in and this solved the issue.\nI use a Macbook Pro and 2 Dell Monitors. \n\nA: I had the same issue which drove me crazy. I checked everything about my Mac and external display, but in the end the problem had been found with an external  USB-C hub connected to my mac. Unplugging it immediately solves the problem.\nSo my suggestion is before all of the software checks (in order to reduce possible troubleshooting time) try to unplug all physical extensions (monitors, mouses, BT devices, etc) and see how it behaves.\nMy tech stack is MacBook Pro (2019) on Catalina 10.15.2 with the (source of the problem) USB-C hub HyperDrive GN30B \n\nA: I have this problem every now and then after I started using a second display on a Mac Mini.\nIt ceases after I reseat both display cables on Mac Mini. I'm running macOS High Sierra 10.13.6.\n\nA: I had this problem too on my new MacBook Pro (2018) Mojave 10.14.3.  As I use the Activity monitor, everything looks healthy - Memory, CPU, etc.  The screen and mouse freezes every few seconds.  Tried all the means to reset the NVRAM, etc. but it has no effect until I disconnect my Mazer USB-C Hub and everything becomes smooth.\n\nA: I could be peripheral. Remove them all and re-add them one at a time.\nFWIW I had very similar issue with a Mac mini. Cursor freezing momentarily about every 4 seconds. It was \"caused\" by USB-C to USB 3 hubs. I had three; two of the same brand caused the issue, the third was fine. Exact cause unknown but in my case it appeared after a RAM upgrade with everything else working perfectly. \n\nA: Facing the same issue on Mac OS Catalina on (macbook pro 15', 2018) with a RedGear Manta USB gaming mouse. That split second pause of the mouse is driving me crazy.\nHere are my observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Happens when no screen is connected.\n\n*Happens when a second screen is connected (Second screen tried in different refresh rates over HDMI - 60/120 Hz)\n\n*Further, I also use bootcamp (win 10) on the same mac - does not occur in windows at all - same hardware.\n\n*For the pause part - buttons and scroll wheel of the mouse are also down.\n\n\nHere comes the fun part:\n\n\n*\n\n*I use this software to use iPad as a second screen - Duet Display\n\n*Does not occur when I use an iPad as a second screen\n\n*Also does not occur when all three screens are connected (incl ipad) ...in any order\n\n*Not able to fool it: Disconnecting ipad immediately brings back the issue.\n\n\nWild hunches\n\n\n*\n\n*If I look closely, sometimes when the mouse freezes and unfreezes, the scrollbar on the side of chrome gets a re-rendering.\n\n*It makes me believe that the mouse gets briefly disconnected from the OS.\n\n*Further, when the ipad is connected as a display over USB, macbook's fans are on.\n\n\nMaybe there is a power issue - where the mouse is fluctuating b/w 100mA and 500mA. (Also, there is an ambience LED in my mouse which I cannot control in macOS).\n\nA: I had this problem too. My HP wireless mouse kept freezing. I looked it up. Followed all kinds of advice to no avail. \nThen yesterday I suddenly thought it might be the mouse batteries.So I changed them and hey presto, problem over. \nI think the batteries last for about 18 months usually. \n\nA: Issue\nI was having a pointer stutter every 10 seconds or so with MacBook Pro plugged into 2 monitors (1 direct to HDMI port & 1 with StarTech lightning to HDMI connector). Stutter occurred when using trackpad or magic touchpad.\nTroubleshooting\nUnplugged HDMI port monitor - still stutters\nUnplugged StarTech adaptor - stutters gone\nReplugged HDMI port monitor - no stutters\nTested with another StarTech adaptor - no stutters\nReplaced with original StarTech adaptor - stutters return\nFault isolated to faulty StarTech Lightning to HDMI adaptor.\n\nA: I had this problem with a wireless logitech mouse M560 and using the usb connector to the CalDigit docking station.\nWhen I used a satechi adapter for the usb plug it worked.\n\nA: Since there's no top level answer that mentions this. I frequently run into this issue, go through SMC/NVRAM reset (although it should no longer be necessary on my M1 Mac), disconnect all my external peripherals and drives, boot in Safe Mode and run Disk Utility Repair on the Macintosh HD, and all that's been described in other answers until today when I finally did the simplest thing and this issue went away:\n\n*\n\n*Go to Bluetooth system preferences pane.\n\n*Click on the circled x icon next to your mouse to remove it (disassociate)\n\n*Confirm the prompt to remove it\n\n*Re-associate it and try to see if the sporadic mouse hanging still occurs\n\n\n\nIn my case the cursor hanging immediately stopped as soon as I paired my trackpad once again. It helped that I was using a trackpad because it made it clear this wasn't a mechanical issue. I suspect something in the bluetooth protocol is prone to something like interference and that maybe when you re-associate a pointer device you get a new channel or something is reset that makes this behavior go away.\nIt's extremely frustrating but I hope this helps whoever couldn't find a solution before.\n\nA: An issue with mouse flickering led me here. \nIn my case issue was with USB-c Secondary Screen (MSI Optix Mag321) with MBP2018\nI connected screen over HDMI - no issue here, no flickering. \nOnce I connected charging USB-c cable (max 15w) mouse start to flicker ~ 10seconds. Different charging cables did not bring any improvements. \nI unplugged charging and Using only HDMI + USB hub (over standard USB cable) and I do not have any symptoms. \nI am yet to try Thunderbolt cable (masked as USB-c). \n\nA: Good news! Apple fixed it in 10.15.6\nI could not believe my eyes that after years of this issue being in the open - Apple has detected and fixed it. Verified with my mouse in various screen configurations - it works seamlessly now.\nI wish there was an explanation for this mysterious bug.\n\n", "Q: What type of partition will be created by Boot Camp Assistant? Will Boot Camp Assistant create an \"OS X Extended\" partition for Windows as well? Or can I choose the type of file system format?\n\nA: Boot Camp Assistant creates a FAT32 formatted partition, not a blank partition. The OS installer you use will reformat the partition, most likely to NTFS if you are using a recent Windows installer.\n\nA: It will create a blank partition which will then get formatted NTFS by your Windows installer.\nFrom Apple's Support Article:  How to install Windows using Boot Camp, Step #4 is:\n\nFormat your Windows partition\nWhen you complete the assistant, your Mac restarts to the Windows\ninstaller.

there.\nFor your model there was a program by Apple to assist with replacing the affected component (the main board) but that has since ended.\nSee http://www.macworld.com/article/2062783/cures-for-a-panicking-mid-2010-macbook-pro.html\nI am sorry to say but you will most likely need to replace your Mac with a newer equivalent Mac as your Mac has a serious hardware fault which can no longer be resolved. You can always get in touch with Apple to discuss your issue further and see if they can help you at all.\nFor your local support number see https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201232\nSource: I am an Apple Certified Mac Technician\n", "Q: Routers that are compatible with Time Machine I'm looking for a router that provides file storage requirements for OS X Time Machine to see the router as a backup destination. I found that Netgear R7000 is supporting it. While unfortunately, Linksys WRT1900ACS doesn't.\nOf course, Apple sells their own solution (Time Capsule) which serves as a router and a time machine destination for backups but I don't prefer to invest in that hardware. \n\nA: Just to clarify, the term \"router\" is incorrect here mostly because it is used incorrectly by manufacturers who sell products in the retail market.\nA router is neither compatible nor incompatible with Time Machine.  A router simply routes network traffic (packets) from one network to another.\nWhat these retail \"routers\" actually are is an amalgamation of\n\n*\n\n*the network router (described above)\n\n*a network switch\n\n*a WiFi access point\n\n*a NAS (network attached storage)\n\n*a server (DHCP, DNS, Web, etc.)\n\n*whatever other nonsense they try to jam into an overpriced, but severely under powered, extremely low quality SoC (System on Chip) covered by flashy plastic.\n\nWhat is incompatible is the NAS functionality of the device.   Specifically in this case, the protocol(s) the router manufacturer chose to include don't include support for Bonjour.\nSolution:  Buy a separate NAS Device\nRelying on a single device that is literally at the edge of your network (meaning it's the security between your internal network and the rest of the WWW (wild wild web), it's risky to store your backups there.\nInstead, get a separate NAS device that supports Time Machine.  Like the Synology (I personally use the DS212j at home)   It fully supports Time Machine and is designed to be a NAS and functions as such.\nIf you have an old computer you can install FreeNAS on it and basically get the NAS for free.  If you have an old Mac, you can turn it into a \"server,\" make a shared directory and backup Time Machine(s) to it over the network.\nBottom line:  Backups are important.  Put it on reliable hardware, not devices that add it on as an afterthought.\n\nA: I personally use a Synology RT1900ac which most definitely supports using an external hard drive for Time Machine quite easily.\nhttps://www.synology.com/en-global/products/RT1900ac\nYou connect your external storage of choice to either its single USB-3 port or an SDXC card into its Card Reader.\nThis review goes into a little detail of how that works if you're interested: http://www.shadowandy.net/2015/10/synology-rt1900ac-review-using-as-nas.htm\n\nA: The Eero router is a good solution; not only does it create a mesh network (meaning it's easier to access the internet and upload files to your Time Capsule from remote corners of a house) but it also is significantly faster. I have had great success with eero + Time Capsule for months. \nEero's website\nEero on Amazon\n\nA: The simplest long-term solution for a Time Capsule-type setup is an older Mac with an external backup drive. I've seen reports here and there that non-Apple systems can have issues when used as Time Machine backups. The entire thing is a house of cards to begin with, but having an Apple system host the backup means it will work as well as you can expect, regardless of the router. I use an ancient 1st-generation Mac Mini with a 4 TB drive plugged in via FireWire, and let that (rather than the router) handle the backups. It shows up as a standard network share and all of our Macs connect to it automatically when needed for backup. The Mini set me back a total of $0, free hand-me-down due to age. I run it headless and connect remotely when I need to do anything to keep it running. It also means that when my router goes down (which has happened due to bad caps or a borked firmware upgrade), I can swap in a spare emergency router without impairing my ability to access Time Machine backups.\nAs for Time Capsule, it's likely that Apple is waiting until APFS is ready to push an update, as the versioning controls in APFS (which do not exist in HFS+) should allow for a much more robust Time Machine setup. (I fully expect that I'll have to retire the Mini when this happens, as it's unlikely Apple will have APFS ported back to PPC machines running Leopard...)\n", "Q: Jammed lock screen button My IPhone 4S recently glitched and the notification screen is stuck disabling me from using it at all. I can't shut it off as my lock-screen button is jammed and cannot be used. I'm just wondering if there is anyway I can easily unjam it?\n\nA: Like Alan said, go to a repair shop or an Apple store and ask tell them what is wrong. I wouldn't take it apart yourself as you may damage it, unless you have experience with repairing stuff. To my knowledge, there really isn't an 'easy' way to fix it. If you want to try it yourself, here is a tutorial: http://www.imore.com/how-diy-repair-stuck-or-broken-iphone-4s-power-button\n", "Q: How do I override the terminal command \"rm\" to perform the \"rm -i\" command by default? The command rm nukes files.\nrm -i asks for confirmation before nuking the files.\nWhen I use rm, I want rm -i to happen.\n\nA: Use an Alias.\n\nThe alias command allows the user to launch any command or group of\ncommands (including options and filenames) by entering a single word\n\nalias rm=\"rm -i\"\n\nThe next time you issue the command rm it will issue rm -i\nYou can also make a new alias in case you want to keep rm functioning as it does by default.  To create a new alias\nalias rmi=\"rm -i\"\n\nNow, rm will have it's default behavior and rmi will have the -i option\nTo make it permanent, just add it to your ~/.bash_profile.  This way, everytime you open a new shell, your alias will be ready to go.\n", "Q: No Sound in Windows 10 via Bootcamp I recently installed Windows 10 using Bootcamp. When I try to turn up the audio nothing happens. I went into device manager and the High Definition Audio Controller has a triangle with an exclamation mark over it. I tried to update the drivers but it said they were already up to date.\n\nA: Sounds like you're missing the Boot Camp software needed for your Mac or it didn't install the audio driver properly.\nTry downloading and running Tim Sutton's excellent Brigadier while in Windows.\nIt should download the latest compatible boot camp software for your model Mac.\nOnce downloaded run the Boot Camp setup file from /Users/(your username)/BootCamp-****/ and reboot when asked.\nShould be fixed.\nBrigadier is here https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier\n", "Q: Make iOS devices by default connect to external audio sources (Airplay/Bluetooth)? Is there a way to get an iOS device to connect to an Airplay server and/or Bluetooth audio device by default?\nI would like my iPad to use my Mac computer's speakers by default, instead of the iPad internal speakers.\nI can think of two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run an AirServer or Airfoil server on the Mac, and somehow get the iPad to connect to that Airplay server by default when it's online.\n\n*Trick the iPad into believing that the Mac is a Bluetooth speaker, and get it to connect there by default.\n\n\nBoth options above would probably require some sort of third-party software like AirServer or Airfoil – or something for Bluetooth – but the big question is if it's possible to get an iOS device to connect by default to an external sound source.\n\nBtw, the way I solve this problem today is simply connecting the iPad to my speakers via an Aux 3.5 mm cable, and simply bypass the computer altogether. I am however thinking of getting a portable Bluetooth speaker or a portable Airplay speaker, and I'm trying to learn how easy it is to use these technologies to use a default audio output. A big advantage of Bluetooth over Airplay would be if it's easier to set a standard output device via Bluetooth, rather than having to use the pesky iOS control center every time one of the devices are put to sleep or shut down.\n\nA: Right now you can only set the default audio routing for calls (phone calls, Skype, FaceTime) by changing the setting for it in Settings -> General -> Accessibility -> Call Audio Routing.\nThere is no method to change the default audio routing for media at this point in time.\n", "Q: Slow reboot after upgrading to OS X El Capitan I upgraded to OS X El Capitan a few days ago and was having issues with reboot and shutdown times. It could take up to a minute. So I cloned back OS X Yosemite from a backup and partitioned part of my SSD and installed OS X El Capitan to troubleshoot. Even on the partition OS X El Capitan still shuts down and reboots slowly. When it finally gets to the Apple logo it boots up fast.\nNot that big of a deal, just was curious what was going on. OS X Yosemite works fine with no lag in reboot and shutdowns.\n\nI have two boot volumes listed, El Cap that's on a partition, and Yosemite. I select the El Cap partition and it boots fine into El Cap after the restart. and when I'm completely shutdown and boot onto El Cap it boots fine, no lag. Its when I'm booted up into El Cap and do a restart or shutdown. That's where the lag is. I tried Verbose mode and when it started up, it did the white text on the screen then booted normally. I really don't know what I'm looking for here.\n\nA: Here are few suggestions to troubleshoot the slow reboot issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*After the system is booted, run:\nsudo dmesg | less\n\nand check for any errors.\n\n*Start up your Mac in safe mode (hold Shift after restart).\n\n*Start up your Mac in single-user mode (CMD-S) or verbose mode ( CMD-V).\n\n*Check for any suspicious messages in /var/log/system.log file during boot time. Or use the Console.app to check the logs during boot time.\n\n*Check the health of your battery using an app.\n\n*If you got any system crashes, please check for any shutdown causes.\n\n*Disable non-Apple kernel extensions (check by kextstat | grep -v com.apple).\n\n*Disable non-Apple services at startup (check by launchctl list | grep -v com.apple).\n\n*Make sure you don't use any custom boot arguments (check by nvram boot-args).\n\n*You can consider booting in verbose mode by: sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\".\n\n*Run Apple Hardware Test on your Mac (hold the D key during on reboot).\n\n*Book an appointment at Genius Bar and ask them to run the full hardware test using their macOS NetBoot Triage Image.\n\n\nA: If you get out a stopwatch, you can break down the various items.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot holding option down - isolate the SMC pointing to the startup volume\n\n*Select the boot image and press return to time things - test the OS starting without the user portion\n\n*Turn off automatic log in - isolate the user part of startup\n\n\nAfter about three starts, you should have a nice table of the timings and can then ask a follow on question on how to fix one or more than one of the items above. The fix for each is different and you may not need any if you get repeatable startup times and it's due to actual work being done. Hard to know without some hard numbers.\n\nA: Make sure that the default boot volume is your boot drive (System Preferences -> Start Up Disk -> Select(Highlight) Boot Drive)\nAlso, boot up with Cmd+v (Verbose). You will see more information and get an idea whats holding up the boot process.\n", "Q: Little Snitch: Does restricting address/port for an application disable future connection prompts? I have downloaded the trial version of Little Snitch.\nAfter install, when I am prompted with connection requests, I have the option to allow or deny the connection via \"Any Connection\" or \"Only\" a specific connection.\n\nIf I select \"Only Forever\", I am assuming that the rule will prevent the application from connecting to another address/port.\nBut if the application wants to connect to another address/port – will I be prompted to set a new rule for that specific address/port – or will the first rule actually block out all future Little Snitch request prompts?\nIn regards to the above question, does the behavior differ between Allow and Deny? E.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I Allow ONLY a certain address AND port – will it disable prompts for all future variants of address and/or port?\n\n*If I Deny ONLY a certain address AND port – will it disable prompts for all future variants of address and/or port?\n\n\nI am assuming that (2) above will just deny that specific combination – but what about restricting allowance as in (1)?\n\nA: If you click Deny on the picture you posted, then no further notifications will be shown [& the connection will be denied] for gamed trying to connect to (static.gc.apple.com AND port 443), not for (static.gc.apple.com OR port 443).\nAny & all other connection attempts will be flagged - e.g. a connection to static.gc.apple.com on port 442 would be flagged, or a connection to notstatic.gc.apple.com on post 443 would be flagged.\nThe next time gamed was launched, your previous deny would again be flagged for your attention, as you only denied it until Quit.\nNote:\nIf you click on the static.gc.apple.com in the line above, you can broaden the domain you wish to block - though it must be said that blocking Apple devices & services [gamed is an Apple service] from connecting to Apple is not really going to be a good move, long-term.\nIn general terms, Little Snitch can be used to block any or all connections for any app or service -  as either a precision tool or a sledgehammer!\nIt should be used with care.\n", "Q: Alt-Tabbing through windows I'm used to having Alt-Tab set to cycle forward through the windows of a single app and Shift-Alt-Tab to go backwards. I had this working on Yosemite by fiddling with the shortcuts in System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\nBut after upgrading to El Capitan, it is only Finder that responds to these commands, no other Apps, although they have not assigned this shortcut for something else.\nIs there a way to enable this behaviour on El Capitan for all apps?\n\nA: I am not sure I understand your problem. The functionality is there and works as expected. Go to System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Keyboard and choose whatever key combination you want for switching windows in Move focus to next window setting, say Alt+Tab. This will switch application windows forward and Shift+Alt+Tab will switch application windows in reverse order, which is exactly what you wanted. The reverse order functionality is already implied by the Shift key and you don't need to set it separately. Mind you that if you choose combination that already includes the Shift key for forward order it will not imply the shortcut for reverse order without the Shift key.\n\nA: This is my solution.\nFirst I remap keys like this to simulate the Windows ctrl+C and  ctrl+V shortcuts:\n\n\nand then I use HyperSwitch like this\n\n", "Q: Bluetooth Speaker microphones: Can they be used for \"Hey Siri\"? I'm considering purchasing a Bluetooth portable speaker that has a built-in omnidirectional microphone.\nThe advertising for the product says that the microphone can be used to \"make calls\" from a mobile device.\nHowever, I can't find out from the support pages if the microphone is \"always on\", or if it's just used for Call Audio Routing – as in iOS's Settings > General > Accessibility > Call Audio Routing.\nMy aim, ultimately, is to use the Bluetooth speaker for playing audio from my iOS device, but also to use it as an always-on microphone that can accept \"Hey Siri\" voice detection commands.\nBasically – an \"Amazon Echo\" device, but consisting of an iPad + Bluetooth speaker instead.\nIs \"Hey Siri\" detection normally possible with mic-equipped Bluetooth speakers?\n\nSpecific case: I'm looking at a Bang & Olufsen Beoplay A1.\n\nA: To corroborate, my BT speaker-with-mic (a FuGoo) and BT-capable car (a 2012 Mazda) will will route microphone input and speaker output to Siri, but only if she's summoned by button press (long press of the play/pause button on the speaker, long-press of the iPhone's home button in the car). Neither will work with \"Hey Siri\". I suspect that one obstacle is that neither device has its microphone continuously listening - they are only activated when needed (a call comes in or you trigger Siri manually).\nI suspect if a BT speaker manufacturer could make \"Hey Siri\" work, they'd be sure to list it in their list of advertising bullet points.\n\nA: After just testing your idea out with my B&O H7 Headphones (that have a mic built in for calls) I can say that Hey Siri didn't work for me unless I was right next to my phone (which means the device's microphone picked it up)\nSiri's voice didn't even get routed out to the headphones and I've checked and the headphones are the current audio output device.\nChanging call audio routing has no effect.\n\nA: The upcoming devices with Apple W1 chip might be able to achieve this...\n", "Q: WD My Passport 0820 USB HFS+ data disk drive partition problem following accidental use of Recovery Assistant I have edited this post in view of recent developments\nI have a 2 TB USB Disk used for all my data.

Then power on the new Mac and follow the setup instructions.\nWhen you get to the question asking if you want to migrate data you would choose the option to do so from a Time Machine backup.\nChoose the Time Machine drive (shows up as a green icon) and then click next.\nChoose what data you want to restore and then click next again.\nFor clarification and further information have a look at, Move your content to a new Mac and How to transfer backups from Time Machine to a new Mac.\n", "Q: Mention an outside payment system for subscription in an iOS app According to Apple's In-App Subscription Rules,\n\nApps can read or play approved content (specifically magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video) that is subscribed to or purchased outside of the app, as long as there is no button or external link in the app to purchase the approved content.\n\nThe questions are: \n\n\n*\n\n*If I don't link my webpage (where the user would be albe to subscribe without going through iTunes) directly but I just mention that it is possible to subscribe via my website (and perhaps I write my website down but I don't make it clickable), would Apple reject my app?\n\n*What if I also mention that if you subscribe via the website you'll get a free month of subscription, but again, I don't provide any automated way to go to my website?\n\n*What if I mention that if you subscribe via website the price will be lower?\n\nA: What you suggest will get rejected very quickly. I read a quote from the guidelines somewhere (sorry, can't pin it down) that included a phrase about not being allowed to induce users to use another, external, payment system of any sort, which would apply to your various mentions. This is exactly what Spotify ran into recently, they removed the ability to subscribe from inside the app, and put in a page mentioning that there was a way to subscribe outside (with no direct \"go here, do this\"). They also (separately?), asked for an email address (to which they could eventually send subscription offers, though they made no mention of that).

I am wondering if whatsapp messages will take a beating from this, and also if facetime will lose its speed and stability during the calls. Any suggestions, advice from experience guys? Thanks!\n\nA: Considering according to Apple the low power setting affects \n\"Background app refresh\nAutomatic downloads\nWi-Fi associations\"\nBy reducing or disabling these features,\nThen yes it will be affected, your WhatsApp won't update its content unless you have it open as the app you're using.

I'd like to delete a game off of an iOS device but I would prefer to not lose my progress in case I want to return. Is there any way of checking whether the game/app puts the game save either in iCloud or another external service?\n\nA: You can see a list of apps using iCloud storage from the Settings → iCloud → Storage → Manage Storage menu. But even if your app is listed, there's no way of checking exactly what data is saved. \n\nA: If you back up the iDevice via iCloud, the game data will be saved there.

This is my fourth MacBook, and in the past I have always used defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES to show hidden files; however, on my new Mac, this is not showing the hidden files. I also tried defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE but still cannot see hidden files in Terminal or in Finder.  I restarted my computer, but that didn't solve my issue either.  Any ideas on how to show my Mac's hidden files?\n\nA: Try this:\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true; killall Finder\n\nThis sets AppleShowAllFiles to true which tells Finder to show all file. Note the -bool part, that tells will make sure you are setting a Boolean to it instead of string, integer etc. Finally it restarts Finder.\n\nA: After you run the defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES command, \nhold the 'option/alt' key, then right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch.\n\nA: Since High Sierra, you can show hidden files in the Finder with the key command: Command Shift Period. This also toggles the show/hide status.\nNo need for Terminal commands or third-party utilities, or relaunching the Finder.\n\nA: Detailed\nYou can make all hidden files visible with this command in the Finder.\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder\n\nHowever, I prefer not to display hidden system files via the terminal, but rather with a shortcut.\nCMD + SHIFT + .\n\nIf you want, you can make a file (several files) visible or invisible again. - Even if you remove the \"hidden\" attribute with chflags, this has no effect if setfile has also stored an attribute\nchflags hidden /path/to/file (Hides the file from the Finder)\n\nchflags nohidden /path/to/file (Does not hide the file from the Finder)\n\nIf the file cannot be made visible again, it may have been hidden using setfile. SetFile\nsetfile -a V /path/to/file (Hides the file from the Finder)\n\nsetfile -a v /path/to/file (Does not hide the file from the Finder)\n\n(To use this command you need the developer tools) xcode-select --install\nNote: There are several types of \"hidden\" files: those that begin with a period and those that are hidden with chflags or the developer's command line utility Setfile.\nYou can see the hidden files that were hidden with chflags here\n ls -lO /path/to/directory\n\n", "Q: Different Computer Modes for MBP Is there a way to set different modes on my Macbook Pro. For example, I use my MBP for work, school and home. When I am at school I do not have my macbook plugged in to a charger and have to choosy as to what apps/services I can run so my battery does not drain. However, when I am at work or home, my MBP is plugged in and the apps/processes running are inconsequential. \nWhat I would like to be able to do, is have like a school mode, which would automatically turn off iCloud Drive sync, OneDrive, Dropbox, Bluetooth, and some other services, all with the click of a button. Then, with another click of a button, turn on, or reenable these app/services when I get to work or home. \nIs there a way to achieve this, or do I just need to manually do it?\nThank you.\n\nA: You can easily do it with Automator workflow and AppleScript:\nOpen Automator\nWhen it asks you what to create, choose \"Application\"\nThen from the Utillities folder on the left, drag the \"AppleScript\" one into the workflow, and instead of the line saying \"You script goes here\", type:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preferences.Bluetooth\"\n    tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        click checkbox \"On\" of window 1\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\nquit app \"OneDrive\"\nquit app \"Dropbox\"\n\nThe first part turns off bluetooth, and the last two lines quit applications.

I have an iPhone 6 and I haven't used cellular data, only Wi-Fi. And every night, only at night while I'm browsing, that tab or whatever it is called keeps popping up and saying that my cellular data is off. I don't understand why do I need to know that multiple times and after appearing a couple of times it turns my Wi-Fi off!\nI don't know what to do. It's really annoying.. Some people said to turn off Bluetooth or something with the chip, I don't know, but my Bluetooth is never on because it wastes my battery for nothing. Not sure what to do, any help appreciated.\n\nA: Apple has some information up at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201673\nIt basically points you to contact the vendor (i.e. your cellular carrier) to troubleshoot problems with cellular data. Apple would help you locate the cellular data on/off switch in settings, but once you've done that - you could back up your phone and erase it / restore a known good OS and re-test cellular data.\nThat would let you know it's not software or settings. Then you would need to determine if your phone needed a hardware repair (less likely but possible) or if your carrier can tell why the coverage is spotty or not continuos. They have the cell tower logs and know how your account is set up (as opposed to Apple that designed the device to work with hundreds of carriers).\n", "Q: MBP battery won't charge I have a MacBook Pro Early 2011 model A1278 which wasn't turning on, then I bought a new battery and it ran just fine.

I tried to reset SMC, NVRAM and cleaned the charging port, but nothing happened. \nNow the battery just died (0%) and I don't know what to do, since I can't charge it up. Is there anything I can do to make it work?\n\nThanks in advance,\nLuiz\n\nA: It appears that you didn't fix the original problem which was why your MBP wasn't turning on in the first place - your battery wasn't charging so you had a dead battery.\nYou have already verified that...\n\n\n*\n\n*the battery is good (it's new)\n\n*the charger is good as it works on another Mac\n\n*the logic board is good because when the battery has juice, it works.  \n\n\nNow, it seems that since the battery has gone to 0% and the charger is plugged in, your MBP is dead, correct?\nThat means you Mag Safe DC In board is most likely shot.\n\nThis is fairly simple to fix (I am assuming you changed your own battery). iFixit.com has an excellent tutorial on how to replace this component.

I can still access the iPad using Touch ID but is there a way I can change the passcode without knowing it?\n\nA: Yes and no. There's no easy way to just change your passcode.\nThere is a way to reset your passcode, but it involves erasing your iPad. You may need to know your Apple ID password.\nApple has steps here.\nThose instructions basically involve going to iCloud.com or iTunes to erase your device. You then would be able to restore from a backup if need to.\nI'm not sure if having Touch ID helps in any way. If you don't have a backup you can, possibly, use iTunes to make a backup first, unless it's brand new and you don't need to worry about restoring anything anyway.\nPossibly you can just do erase all contents and settings in Settings > General > Reset and enter your Apple ID passcode too, but I'm not sure.\nWhatever you do, avoid rebooting the iPad, because then TouchID will no longer work and you'll be forced to use the iCloud or iTunes erase and restore.\n\nA: Connect to iTunes and make a backup, this can be done using touch ID. Then erase your iPad. Restore from Backup and I believe it will ask you to create a new PIN. It's not possible to access the passcode settings without actually knowing the passcode.\n", "Q: How to set default fonts in Mac?

But they said iOS doesn't slow down speed when downloading a file through personal hotspot and said probably my carrier throttling my speed. But still I think iOS slows down my Internet speed because of a clear reason which I've explained below. So I want  know whether iOS slows down my Internet speed when I downloading a torrent or my carrier throttling when downloading a torrent.\nReasons to think Apple may do that : I've downloaded torrents before using hotspot feature like 1 year ago. But several things now have changed.\n\n\n*\n\n*That time I used a Nokia phone which clearly have no hotspot restrictions. \n\n*That was about 1 year ago. So carriers might have taken actions to throttle speed when downloading torrent.\nWhat I want to know : \n\n\n*\n\n*Does iOS slow down internet speed when downloading torrents? \n\n*What could be the reason of slow torrent speed on this situation? ( torrents basically have several hundred seeders) \n\n*What actions can I take to get full speed? \n\nA: I don't know of any traffic shapping or bandwidth throttling capabilities of iOS.  Technically, you would need stateful packet inspection to be able to detect Torrents and then slow them down (traffic shaping); this is found on many advanced routers and most definately not in iOS.\nMost likely, it's your ISP that's doing the throttling.\n\nHundreds of larger and smaller ISPs all over the world try to limit\n  BitTorrent traffic on their networks. Unfortunately, most companies\n  are not very open about their network management solutions, with\n  Comcast as the prime example.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nWhat you want to do is Test to see if your carrier is blocking/slowing down your traffic.\n\nTest if your ISP is blocking Bittorrent\nThis is a Java applet and does not require a Bittorrent client.  It will compare the download speed of a small test file seeded through Bittorrent with the download speed of the same file through normal file transfer.  If the difference is significant it will indicate that your ISP is throttling your file transfer.\n", "Q: How does one stop the \"Select A Wireless Network\" prompt on iOS 10 Beta? The \"Select A Wireless Network\" prompt keeps popping up every 5 seconds. I DO NOT have the \"ask to join wireless networks\" marked on and I am already joined to a network but this will not stop. Anyone have any fixes for that? It is a major PITA. Thanks.\n\nA: Firstly, make sure to report the issue using Feedback Assistant. Then, try toggling the setting in Settings, as it might fix the issue. If it doesn't, try restarting the iPhone. Then you could also try backing up the iPhone, erasing all data on it, then restoring the backup. But, if that still doesn't fix the issue, and it really bothers you, you can always downgrade to iOS 9.3.2.\n\nA: Turn your phone off and start back up after about 3-5 minutes.  This resolved the issue for me.  \nThe issue started yesterday when I tried to turn off \"Ask to Join Networks\" (although not having the issue) and it started prompting about every 5 minutes.  I tried to turn it back on and the issue persisted until I restarted my phone.  \n\nA: Trying erasing and restoring from backup. I am on iOS 10 beta and it doesn't ask me continuously.\n", "Q: Unable to verify account name or password My Mac Pro asks for an e-mail and password.\nI was unable to remember them; I got a new password, but I'm still receiving an error message:\n\nUnable to verify account name or password.\n\n\nA: Watch out for Two-step verification\nIf you have Two-step verification enabled most probably this is the reason why isn't working, Mac Mail app doesn't handle well this feature.\nThe solution:\nA. The fast way:\n\n*\n\n*Go to this page: https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage/additional\n\n*Enter your Microsoft email address and password (if prompted)\n\n*Under \"App passwords\" section, select \"create password\" and copy it.\n\n*Go to the Mail app a select \"Mail > Accounts...\" from the menu.\n\n*Select the email account (Hotmail/outlook) and in the field \"Password\" paste the password that you copied in step 3\n\n*Hit enter.\n\n*Done.\n\nB. In case you don't trust the previous link, the whole way to get to the page on Option A is:\n\n*\n\n*Go to your Hotmail/Outlook account in a web browser.\n\n*Select your picture/name in the top right corner and select \"View Microsoft Account\".\n\n*Select \"Security\" from the top menu.\n\n*Select \"Update Info\" in the \"Update security info\" section (Type your password if prompted).\n\n*Continue on step 3 of option A.\n\n*Done.\n\nThis solution allows you to keep you two-steps verification and at the same time use Mac Mail app which is unable to verify your account because of it.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I suspect your old password is still in the Keychain; go to Applications > Utilities > Keychain Assistant. Search for your account (usually your email) or the server used. Then doubleclick on the entry and check the checkbox in front of Show Password. Verify that it's the new password which is stored there.\nIt's safe to delete multiple entries of the same account, you should just have one entry.\nThe background is that Apple Mail.app will first try and use the password(s) stored in the login Keychain and when those fail, it will prompt the user to enter the new password.\nSee this article on how to manage your Keychain.\n\nA: I had a similar problem when I changed my email password via the service providers web login. The browser gives the facility to show your password so I could double check I had the correct new password for my Mac Mail client. However, I kept getting the same error 'unable to verify user name or password'. \nI contacted the service provider, BT in this instance, for them to confirm there was nothing wrong with my account and I should contact Apple. Despite reminding them that this account had worked fine until the password was changed they had nothing else to offer. So I set about trying another email client on another device, a) using MS Mail and b) Thunderbird on Windows 10. Again I was unable to set up the BT mail account. \nIn desperation I changed my password once more, this time making sure I only used plain text characters and, hey presto, MS Mail connected, Mac Mail connected and I was back up and running. \nThe problem appears to be that the login via the web browser seems to accept non text characters e.g. '+' but these somehow do not pass through the same from external clients. \n\nA: I changed my IMAP and SMTP servers to\nIMAP: outlook.office365.com\nSMTP: smtp.office365.com\nand it started to work.\n\nA: I also had this problem, and solved it by changing my app password in Keychain Access! Keychain Access had an old password stored there.\n\nA: I was going crazy with this issue, I rebooted the modem and router and it worked right after. \nLook at your network if you have this problem and not at the Mac \n\nA: Warning: Don't try this if you have a POP account. With IMAP it should be alright. \nI tried all the answers mentioned on this page but nothing seemed to work. I had just reset my password for a web account on Safari which started this problem.\nI ended up deleting the Email account from \"Internet Accounts\" and then Re-creating the account (It was a Microsoft Exchange account).\nPOP accounts don't save copies to server so if you delete it, all your email is gone.\n", "Q: How to repair a drive after accidentally changing the partition scheme?

I would like to know if there is something wrong I have done by leaving it on the socket, because I do it all the time with my PC adapters. I'm new to Apple Macs.\n\nA: No.  You don't do any damage to a power adapter by leaving it in.\nThe fact of the matter is that power adapters die for one reason or another. \nPersonally, I have power adapters for products that have been in use for well over 15 years, being plugged in all day, every day.  I also have power adapters that barely last a year.  For the most part, my devices that have these types are power supplies are plugged into surge suppressors with most plugged into UPSs; so I couldn't protect them any more than they already are.\nIn your case, it appear that the power adapter was defective and Apple took care of it under warranty.

This prevents VirtualBox from functioning (see here, for example).\nAttempting to fix the permissions with a simple sudo chown root /Applications gives the error chown: /Applications: Operation not permitted.  This is pleasantly vague, and the Internet assures me that there may be many causes.  (I had other sources I could cite, but I'm new to this site, and thus can only post up to 2 links.)\nI do not wish to just start removing flags carelessly from /Applications, so I've done some investigating instead.  Here's what's NOT the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*File flags:  Only the sunlnk flag is set, which prevents /Applications from being deleted.  Seems entirely appropriate for /Applications, so I think there's no problem there.

So I decided to replace it myself with a Samsung 850 EVO, all went okay, but now when I turn it on all I get is a file with a question mark in it.\nI couldn't upload anything to the SSD before installing as my Mac wasn't working at all and had a white screen with a spinning wheel. I had no new operating system on my Mac as I hadn't updated it in a while. A CD came with the drive but my laptop is having none of it it just turns on to a white screen with the mouse on it.\nAs you can see I'm not very technical so if any responses could be dulled down a bit that would be helpful!\n\nA: If you can get it online (for example, with an Ethernet cable), all you have to do is hold command-R at startup to enter recovery mode and install the OS over the Internet.

Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.\n\n(from the Steam website)\nI really recommend you read more about Steam Refunds here, and then buy the game. It's a really awesome, EXTREMELY competitive game (and I mean, 120-tick rate type of competitive) with a HUGE and very... interesting community.

By default, screenshot files are saved with names like this:\nScreen Shot 2016-07-12 at 1.07.34 PM.png\nThe date format is great, but the time format annoys me because it doesn't sort automatically. Is there any way to change the format to:\nScreen Shot 2016-07-12 at 13.07.34.png\n\nA: I've found the most minimal solution (on macOS 10.14.3) to be:\nSystem Preferences → Language & Region, then click Advanced..., choose the Times tab and for the Medium format click the hour dropdown and switch it from 1-12 to 00-23 and delete the AM/PM element:\n\n\nA: It's using the system's standard date/time display format which you can customise in the 'Formats' tab in System Preferences → Language&Text \nOr, it might be quicker to just change the time display of the clock to 24-hours mode: System Preferences → Date & Time \n(I have OS X 10.7.5, so it may be organised/worded slightly differently in newer OS X versions.) \n\nA: Thanks for the tip on changing the time format.\nI asked in the Apple forum how to change the text because it used to start with \"Screenshot\" - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251714867\nThe answer is:\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture name \"Screenshot\"\nkillall SystemUIServer\n\nSo now the format looks like \"Screenshot 2020-08-22 at 10.18.35.png\" - almost back to where I want it.\nI haven't worked out how to remove \"at\" between date and time though.... yet :) \nFor more information and some background, see my blog post.\n", "Q: How to get rid of Applescript confirmation?

I have a folder icon in my icon list that opens my 'Downloads' folder.\nThe folder isn't visible on my screen after a while because I have other apps open and they get hidden under them.\nHow can I see all the folders I have currently open?  I usually just open another one and its a pain.\n\nA: I didn't exactly understand what you meant by \"icon list\" or generally what you are asking, but i guess you mean that you have several Finder windows open, and you want to easily see all of them. You have a few ways of accomplishing this task:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Mission Control, either by using the swipe gesture (three-finger swipe up on a trackpad or two-finger swipe up on the magic mouse) or by pressing F3. This will neatly organize all the current windows open in your space (aka desktop or full-screen application).\n\n*You can use the more specific App Exposè, which shows you all of the current windows for a specific app. So focus on just one of the Finder windows, and go into the App Exposè by either using the swipe gesture if you have it enabled (which is the same as the Mission Control gesture, just down instead of up), or by (I think) pressing FunctionF10.\n\n*Lastly, you can see a list of all the open windows on a specific app (on your case Finder) by right-clicking (or Control-clicking) it's dock icon.\n\n\nIf you find yourself having a lot of folders open a lot of times, I REALLY recommend that you tabs instead. You can always open a new finder tab by pressing command+tab and you can press command+option+tab to toggle the tab bar.\n", "Q: Does homebrew usually put lots of files in the /usr/local folder itself?

The user will still have to click \"Connect\" to mount the share. \nDoes anyone know if this is a \"bug\" in the beta version (I did report this with Apple's Feedback app), or is this expected and/or what would be the \"fix\" for that?\nSee also: AppleScript Documentation \"mount volume\"\n\nA: This has been fixed by Apple in macOS Sierra 10.12.2:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207112\n\nA: As Apple replied to the ticket referenced in mattdwen's Open Radar link above, as of macOS Sierra 10.12,\n\nyou can no longer create items in /Volumes unless root.\n\nFurther, my best understanding of the AppleScript mount volume command is that it doesn't have a way to specify the mount point and consequently it only mounts volumes under /Volumes through the Finder's standard mechanism. So, I don't think you can do it via AppleScript.\nBut there's another way. You can accomplish the same thing using the lower level mount command:\nmkdir -p ~/mnt\nmount_smbfs \"//my_username:my_password@my_hostname/share\" ~/mnt\n\nAfter mounting the volume this way, you should see a normal \"volume\" icon appear on your desktop and the ~/mnt directory will appear as \"share\" when you browse your user directory via Finder.\nThe one thing missing from this approach is saving the login credentials in Keychain. To do that, you have to do a bit more scripting. Something like this.\nSave the password:\nsecurity add-generic-password -a my_username -s my_hostname -w my_password\n\nRetrieve the password and mount the share:\npass=$(security find-generic-password -a my_username -s my_hostname -w)\nmount_smbfs \"//my_username:${pass}@my_hostname/share\" ~/mnt\n\nNOTE: If you have special characters in your password, you will probably need to URL encode it, perhaps like this:\npass='my !@#%%^& password'\npass=$(php -r \"echo urlencode(\\\"$pass\\\");\")\n>>> my+%21%40%23%25%25%5E%26+password\n\n", "Q: How can I disable a specific USB port in my MacBook? BRCM2046 is the USB card from my macbook (according to System Profiler), and one of the ports is a problem that it generates an error on the console.\nI would like to know how to disable this port.\n\nA: There isn't a switch in OS X to go and disable some of the USB connections. If you could give up USB entirely, I suppose you could get at things at the kernel extension level, but in terms of a graphical interface, there isn't anything like network preference panes where you could pick amongst the devices and disable one but not another.\nSee https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-USB-Inject-All for a decent discussion on some of the recent changes to USB and kext. It's quite technical, but also well documented case how to modify things at a low level.

The developers at PCV, who created the game, are no longer able to tell me.\nThanks\n\nA: According to this resource, the game picture shown uses various icons downloaded from http://xicons.macnn.com. However, this address does not exist anymore. The only reminder there about icons is on the forum and leads to an old http://www.xicons.com, which does not exist either and redirects to https://interfacelift.com now.

The previous owner sold it to me because the computer would not power on. It turned out the magsafe charger was broken and it had run out of battery. \nAfter replacing the magsafe charger, the computer now charges and after a minute or so it powered itself on. I have also replaced the internal hard drive with a brand new SSD. \nNow, it \"boots\" up and says no bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key which is exactly what I exptected it to do. \nThe thing is, both the keyboard and the power button is not responding. So I can't press on any key and I can't turn the computer off.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the keyboard and power button issue related? In other words, is it the same \"cable\" on the inside powering them both? Or is this two separate issues?\n\n*Will it work if I connect an external keyboard via USB?\n\n\n\nUpdate\nI ordered a replacement keyboard from Ebay, but when I was in the process of taking the laptop apart, I noticed that the keyboard \"connector cable\" that sits on the logic board was loose. After refitting the cable I decided to put it back together again - leaving the original keyboard inside.\nNow it responds to the power button (keyboard and power button is connected to the same cable), but the keyboard still won't work. \nSo I connected an external USB keyboard (that I have confirmed works on a PC), but that will not work either. \nIt powers on, and after a few seconds it just says no bootable device... bla bla even though I have the original OS X DVD in the tray (and I can hear it working on boot). \n\nA: Would it boot with the old (original) hard drive? If so, you need to either clone the HDD to the SSD via Disk Utility (hold Cmd+R at boot), or install OS X anew on the SSD. You can use DiskMaker X to prep a USB installer, or use a OS X install DVD, assuming you can find one and the MacBook has an optical drive (fairly sure a '10 model does). \nJust sounds like a mechanical issue with the keyboard, but hard to know without OS X installed. I would simply plug in a USB keyboard (any keyboard will work) and try that.  \n\nA: \n\n*It will work if you connect an external keyboard via USB.\n\n\nPS: If you boot the macbook, hold down the option (alt) button to get the boot menu and install Mac OS X.\n", "Q: Is there a way to show all open windows in OSX 10.9+?

Now, with mission-control, there is only \"show all application windows\", which is much less useful. Is there a way I can restore the hotcorner \"show all windows\" functionality on my mac running OSX 10.9.5?\n\nA: It's a while since I used Mavericks but on OS X 10.11.5 El Capitan in the system preferences for Mission Control there's a Hot Corners button in the bottom left corner.\nOpening this I was able to assign the bottom left hot corner to 'Mission Control'. This is about as close to what I recall Expose doing as I can get.\nThe resulting Mission Control view makes sense to me as it shows the applications open in the desktop space and identifies the other applications occupying their own spaces.\nI'm not sure I find the 'Show all Applications' option much use at all either.\nThanks for asking the question - I've gotten used to using the 3 finger 'push' to bring up Mission Control on my MacBookPro.

Is there an easy way to get this done? Please explain to me how to do it. Thanks.\n\nA: If your airline is Delta\nCheck into your flight with this page of Delta's website on your iPhone/iPod Touch (have your flight's confirmation number ready). When you complete your checkin, you will be given an option to add the pass to your Passbook (aka Wallet app). Tap into that, then press the Add button to add the pass to your wallet. Then you can skip the check-in kiosk at the airport if you have your phone and the pass handy.\n\nAny other airline\nDownload the airline's app (yep, only Delta lets you use the mobile site to add a boarding pass to Wallet) and open it up. Here are some apps from the major carriers (though don't fret if your airline is not on this list, it's rather incomplete; just search for it in the app store):\n\n\n*\n\n*United\n\n*JetBlue\n\n*Alaska\n\n*American Airlines\n\n*RyanAir\nProceed into the app (have your confirmation number or loyalty account info ready) and choose the Check in option (location of this button varies between apps).

Press that, then press the Add button in the Navbar and you'll be set.\n\nA: I have Delta, and had checked in on a computer.  I found that when I logged into the Delta app on my iphone, I was able to navigate to my trip and add the boarding pass to my wallet there.  Just one other option.  Delta used to let me add the boarding pass directly to my wallet when I pulled up the boarding pass notification.  Kind of annoying to have that functionality taken away...\n", "Q: What happens to MY music if I join a new Family Sharing account My wife already has an iTunes account with her own music library.  She also wants access to my music library.  If I set up Family Sharing and invite her, will she lose her music or will the iPhone display both music from her personal account library AND my account library?  Thanks!  \n\nA: Family Sharing allows all members to access Apps, Books, Tunes etc purchased by all members [though not the 'data content' of any App, so for instance each member's level on Angry Birds, or whatever would not cross-pollinate]. It will also add a shared calendar for which usage is optional.  \nIt doesn't share anything else. It also doesn't delete anything, only adds.\nIf your iTunes Library contains CD rips or music not purchased directly via your iTunes account, that would not be available to other family members, you would have to copy it to their Mac/PC/iTunes manually.\n", "Q: Mid '11 Mac Mini won't shutdown cleanly.

Recovery Image verification fail with status [0x800000000000000e]\nError loading kernel cache 0oxe)\nWhat could be the issue here? Anyone know what logs files I can check and where? Thanks. \n\nA: Firstly, you should update to OS X 10.11.6. It will solve many problems. Download 10.11.6 Update.\nSecondly, reset SMC. Here is a link how to do it: Resetting System Management Controller.\nIf it doesn't help, try clean install: How to Clean Install El Capitan.\nADDITION:\nIf you can't do clean install using your own mac, make a bootable USB on another mac: Click here.\nAlso, go to Utilities and run Console.app for inspecting what's wrong with your OS: Click here.\nIt might be a problem with a hardware, so try single-user mode pressing cmd-s after startup 'chime' sound or verbose mode pressing cmd-v the same way. To read about it Click here. \nAnd read an important post about 7 Mac Startup Options: Click here.\n\nA: Try to\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into verbose mode (hold option-V during boot), and then try to shutdown. Does the log appear?\n\n*After you option-clicked on Apple->Shutdown, wait for two minutes. Does a windows saying \"Application xyz prevented shutdown appear?\"\n\n*Please check any non-apple extensions by running\n\nkextstat -l | grep --invert-match com.apple\n\nin the Terminal\n\nThanks for the feedback. When you boot into verbose mode, you automatically shutdown in verbose mode too; that was the main reason I suggested you do that so you see if it hangs \"during\" shutdown.\n\"Normal\" applications that do not close upon request will get you a \"Application xyz prevented shutdown\" window. So since you do not have that, it's very likely to be a driver issue. I would suggest you manually kextunload (just search stackoverflow on how to do that) these extensions before you shutdown just to test if that fixes the problem. I'll think again if I come up with an idea what might be the issue here.\n(s.th. like this, but you may have to check if there are dependent kext's you have to unload first)\n\nsudo kextunload -b com.github.osxfuse.filesystems.osxfusefs\n\n\nBe aware that an application-level firewall might block a network request of a (system) application that is executes when it is asked to terminate for shutdown. This might cause the behaviour you experience. You should definitely try just to turn off the firewall and see if the shutdown then works properly. This is a rather likely cause, i had something similar with little snich some time ago.\nOnce you have triggered shutdown, you can also manually kill processes that you think might be hindering the shutdown process to find the root cause.\nGo \"ps -A\" and then \"sudo kill -9 ####\" with ### being the process number to terminate. Since the \"force shutdown\" from the command line works, this will likely lead to a shutdown, too.\n\nA: This was an OS software issue after all.

Long story short, I've written a simple BASH script to control the brightness of a non-Apple external monitor using ddcctl. It works, with a couple hacks.\nIt would be really cool if I could display a notification when the script is called, so the end user can be aware what the current setting is relative to min/max. I just found out about AppleScript's display notification function, which is cool—but the notifications don't go away on their own.

I checked with people in the \"TO\" field and they didn't receive this message. \n\n\nA: This spammer must have acquired these contact numbers from an email account's contacts page belonging to one of the people who received this. Then, they sent a text message to some of the contacts they found. The To field is auto-filled by your phone with all the people who received the text. For instance, if I texted a message to you and some guy (let's call him Joe Smith) the To field would be filled with \"To John Ramos and Joe Smith\", indicating that any text you send in that group chat will go to the people in said group chat; that's exactly what's going on here. \n", "Q: Arrange different external displays of same model to different positions I am running Mac OS X (Version 10.10.5) on a MacBook Pro (13 Inch, Mid 2010) and want to arrange an external monitor of the same type to different positions.\nFirst, let me explain my setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*monitor at my office: DELL U2312HM (located above the MacBook's screen)\n\n*monitor at home: DELL U2312HM (located left of the MacBook's screen)\n\n\nAs you can see, I am using different monitors of the same type (they have different serial numbers displayed in the System Overview window).

The monitor arrangement does not depend on the monitor's serial number but on the model since saving the arrangement of different models works as desired.\nSo is there a way, a hidden setting, a hidden setting accessible through the terminal or even a third-party app which enables different monitor arrangements for the same monitor model but based on the monitor's serial number as shown in the system overview?\nThe behavior which seems to be a system default is very annoying and does not feel very apple-like.\n\nA: I wrote a free terminal tool called displayplacer that lets describe your monitor layout as a terminal command.

It solved the same problem for me of using the same model monitor at work (in portrait mode) as at home (in landscape mode).\nFor example, on my 4 monitor setup at home I have this profile: displayplacer \"id:A46D2F5E-487B-CC69-C588-ECFD519016E5 res:3840x2160 hz:60 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \"id:F466F621-B5FA-04A0-0800-CFA6C258DECD res:1440x900 color_depth:4 scaling:on origin:(-1440,1437) degree:0\" \"id:4C405A05-8798-553B-3550-F93E7A7722BB res:1440x2560 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(3840,-363) degree:270\" \"id:18173D22-3EC6-E735-EEB4-B003BF681F30 res:1920x1200 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(960,-1200) degree:0\"\nAlso available via Homebrew brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer\n\nA: There is a product out there that will remember your monitor configurations - it's called Stay\nFrom their website:\n\nStay can store a set of windows for every combination of displays that you use with your computer. Stay can also be configured to automatically restore windows as displays are connected and disconnected.\n\n\nA: This appears to now be built into the operating system (as discovered when I asked the same question): Is there a way to automate the movement of application windows to assigned monitors?\nThanks to @Hefewe1zen for their answer:\nPlace the application window on the desired screen. \nThen right click its Dock icon -> Options -> Assign To -> (select desired target)\n\nThese functions are especially helpful if you use Spaces.\n\n", "Q: Changing the Country & Region with Gift Card You can assume that I am able to change Country & Region.

The current transfer rate seems to be around 3-4MB/s on HFS Journaled, and the rate was way lower when I formatted it with exFAT. I see some methods for increasing speeds on other devices like Android mobiles, which involve changing the cache, and also on OSX but only for command line processes? Is there a way to implement this when dragging files over with Finder?\n\nA: Indicated write/read speeds are always higher than what you should expect from a card.\nUsually, the filesystem doesn't make a difference to the RW speeds.\nDo also remember that copying many small files is significantly slower than copying one big file due to the entries required to the FS.\nIf you'd like to test your write speeds with the filesystem, try\ndd if=/dev/zero | pv -betrP -s 100M -S | dd of=/path/to/your/device/temporaryfile \n\nThe above command will dd 100 mebibytes of zeros into a file into your microSD card, and will return a speed in MiB/s.\n\nA: If you have many small files to transfer over, avoid the processing overhead the Finder imposes on file drags by using the Terminal command cp. Type man cp for all the details. Should you be using the MicroSD card as off-line archival storage for many small files, consider compressing the set of files into a zip archive, then transfer the .zip file to the card, which will copy over much faster.\n", "Q: Installed gcc with Homebrew, now how to use that gcc instead of clang? I installed gcc with brew install gcc, but when I type gcc the default behavior is still to use clang.  How do I set things so that typing gcc in the terminal automatically uses the gcc installed by Homebrew?\n\nA: you can use gcc-7 instead\nreference https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/40374\n\nA: First, examine your $PATH variable.\necho $PATH\n\nThe gcc from homebrew should be a symbolic link that resides in /usr/local/bin for Intel and Rosetta 2 installs or /opt/homebrew/bin for Apple Silicon. When this brewed version of gcc shows up in the path listed before the Xcode version of gcc/clang, you’re done - the local compilers will be called unless a package is hard coded to the full path of a different compiler than the one you have in /usr/local\nIf you change the PATH variable - be sure to log out of the shell or rehash the shell as appropriate.\nThis answer has an elegant solution using aliases as well - so you don't even have to think or care about path if you have more than one gcc installed. It goes deeper to let you choose which version of gcc to call if you happen to install more than one version.\n\nA: If which gcc gives you\n> which gcc\n/usr/bin/gcc\n\nYou have two options:\n\n*\n\n*Create an alias.\n\n\n*Make a new gcc symlink under /usr/local/bin/.\nHomebrew links own gcc under /usr/local/bin/gcc-<version> for\ncompatibility. So, doing\nln -sf /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 /usr/local/bin/gcc\nwill point a /usr/local/bin/gcc symlink to gcc-4.9 installed by Homebrew which should override the gcc from /usr/bin if your PATH specifies /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin.\n\nA: When you build C/C++/Objective C etc. applications you usually do not run the C compiler from the command line you use a build system - which one of the simplest is a makefile.\nThe standard Unix way (e.g. from pre gcc being the only compiler) is that you pass information to the build system where your compiler is. Often this is the environment variable CC for C compiler CPP or similar for C++.\nthis is often done on the command line\ne.g.\nmake CC=/usr/bin/clang  all # for Clang\n\nmake CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.9 all # for gcc-4.9 under Homebrew\n\n\nA: To use Homebrew's version, you're best off creating symbolic links to the latest version of GCC installed by Homebrew, and placing them into /usr/local/bin.\nThe example zsh script provided below will do this for you, and will also remove the version number suffixed to the filename by Homebrew's installation formula.\n# Choose the directory containing the latest version of GCC\n# as indicated by the highest number suffixed to \n# the filepath of the package directory\nprint -v version /usr/local/opt/gcc@<->(n[-1])\nversion=${version#*@}\nfor file in /usr/local/opt/gcc@${version}/bin/*-${version}(*); do\n    tail=${file:t}\n    ln -sf ${file} /usr/local/bin/${tail%-*}\ndone\n\nNow you're good to go.

You can also find this path by running which gcc-11.\nYou can then symlink this file to /usr/local/bin/gcc using this command:\nsudo ln -s $(which gcc-11) /usr/local/bin/gcc\n\nJust make sure that /usr/local/bin in your $PATH comes before /usr/bin to override clang\n", "Q: Facebook iOS app won't connect unless wi-fi enabled I recently download the Facebook app for iOS. It doesn't connect to the internet unless wi-fi is enabled. All other apps are able to connect to the internet with wi-fi disabled, just not Facebook.

Any suggestions?\n\nA: You can change the channel of your router, maybe it is the problem with it. \nAnother possibility is that a Firewall is preventing this. Go to System Prederences-Privacy and Security and then find the Firewall option. Check if it is turned on or off. Change it to either way and check if you can connect now.\nAdditionally, you can go to Keychain Access app and try to remove everything related to the router such as its password or ... But be careful and don't remove important passwords. \nYou can also use the built in diagnoser, which is in System Preferences- Network-Assist Me. See what it suggests. It usually says that you'd better turn your router off for a minute and turn it on again.\nYou actually have to play (!) with three files in your System Configuration, which the link below explains how.\nThis discussion in Apple Discussions is also noteworthy : https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6354581?tstart=0\n\nA: I can't comment, as I don't have the rep - but have you checked /var/log/wifi.log when you've tried to connect?

I bought the expanded icloud for music and phone data. many thanks for your feedback..\n\nA: iCloud stores data in many different ways so to explain about just transferring stored data would need more input on what you'd like to store.\nThere's nice instructions from Apple that you could read on the iCloud help page but just to break it down to you first of all what you write about the music which I believe you're referring to iTunes Match which has nothing to do with your iCloud subscription plan and has a limit of 100,000 songs and some other minor limitations.\nNow about the iCloud subscription, you could setup in the iCloud settings under Backup that your phone should backup your phones content to iCloud at regular intervals which is explained here and you just need to make sure that you check on or off those apps you'd like to include or exclude getting your backup and that could be achieved by tapping into Storage within your iCloud settings then select the Manage Storage and under BACKUPS select your iPhone which should say underneath its name \"This iPhone\" there you'll be able to toggle them on and off.\nThe next thing is iCloud photo library where your device automatically uploads all photos and videos to your iCloud account which is all explained here, I personality love it knowing that my captured moments are always safe which is somewhat safer than having it only backed up at your regular iCloud backup intervals since this happens constantly while you're connected to WiFi.\nAnd finally there's iCloud Drive where app developers could choose to save some of your data there and you could choose to disallow certain apps from accessing them (they could only access these data known to developers as iCloud Container) and if you have a Mac this comes in useful since you could save your files on your iCloud Drive on your Mac and access them on your iOS devices and vice versa.\n", "Q: Export Keychain Items is not enabled from File menu of Keychain Access As can be seen in the screenshot I have selected a bunch of keychain items.

I import the two files into the Photos app, and it combines them into one. I like this.\nHowever, I have now used ExifTool to add in the GPS coordinates. I deleted the old files and re-imported them with the exact same file names. Now I have two pictures when I was expecting one.\nIf I take the original files and re-import them, they get combined again.\nIs there some way to get Photos.app to realize that the two files should be combined?\n\nA: I recently looked at a set of JPEG + RAW pairs that Apple Photos failed to match up. The behavior I observed was:\nThe images were geotagged and had GPS timestamp: GMT time of the GPS fix used to tag the images.\nOn the JPEG, Photos looked at the photo time and GPS time and figured that the clock time was 1 hour apart. It concluded that the camera clock was set to GMT+1.\nOn the RAW, it seems that Photos ignored the GPS time. Instead it worked from my computer clock. This is at GMT+2. It loaded the RAW assuming that the camera clock was set to GMT+2.\nIn the Photos application, both JPEG and RAW were displayed with the same clock time: the one recorded by the camera. In the library however the images were stored with timestamps 1 hour apart. The only way to “see” this in the Photos application was to sort the images by date. Pairs were not be sorted next to each other.\nOne fix is to use ExifTool or HoudahGeo to write timestamps including time zone offsets to both JPEG and RAW files. Once the timestamps on the JPEG and RAW are an exact match, Photos should recognize the pair.\nBTW: I do consider this to be a bug in Apple Photos. The assumption that camera and computer clock are set the same time zone is rather common, yet unfortunate. The fact that Photos makes different assumptions on the JPEG and the RAW surely is a bug.\nFull disclosure: I am the developer behind HoudahGeo.\n", "Q: Terminal.

The dual boot to OSX El Capitan and Windows was working just fine until about a month ago. I was switching operating systems using the option key at bootup through the Bootup drive selection screen and it was all working fine. \nThe problem I am facing right now is that every time I turn my laptop on or try to switch Operating systems using the option key the drive selection screen takes a long time to appear, like literally 20 to 30 seconds. This is not really normal because it used to be much faster. Also, once it appears with the Macintosh HD, Windows, and Recovery drives the mouse pointer just doesn't work or sometimes work un-reliably or extremely slowly. I have tried wireless and wired mouse in the screen and the results are similar. I can use the arrow keys in the keyboard to select the drives but the response is just too slow. Once i hit an arrow key it takes 15 to 20 seconds to register and move the selection, sometimes it doesn't respond at all. And then finally when I hit return it takes another half a minute or so to load up the boot sequence (Apple logo for OSX and spinning circle for Windows).\nI ran diskutil to verify the volumes but everything seems fine. The disk health shows fine and I also ran First Aid on the Macintosh HD as well, but to no avail. I then tried by resetting the SMC and NVRAM but the problem still persisted. I updated bootcamp drivers as well as Windows updates, but the situation stayed. Finally, I took the laptop to an Apple store and the technician saw the issue, never ran any diagnostic and simply said something like \"looks like an issue with EFI, we will have to send it for repair to change the logic board because the memory is soldered into the logic board\", I couldn't fully understand what he meant by that and I am skeptical if it is really a hardware issue because the operating systems (OSX and Windows) both run just fine once it boots up.\nA few odd behaviors I noticed-\n\n\n*\n\n*When restarting from Windows to OSX the boot drive selection screen sometime works normal. Fast and as if nothing really happened. \n\n*When booting up the machine from a powered down state into OSX (without using\noption key, since Macintosh HD is my primary boot drive)\nthe boot sequence (Apple logo with the loading bar) takes a while to\nappear.\n\n*This issue probably didn't happen until I upgraded to OSX 10.11.5 from\n10.11.4/3.\n\n\nPoints worth mentioning:\nI use Tuxera NTFS and I know that there is a known NTFS driver compatibility issue between OSX default NTFS driver and Tuxera's NTFS version. Thinking this could be the problem I tried to repeat all the remediation steps by completely disabling Tuxera, but the problem still persisted. I feel that Tuxera may not be an issue because I have been using both Bootcamp Windows and Tuxera for quite a while and never faced any issues. I am considering a clean install of bootcamp with Win 8.1 Pro, if I absolutely have to, but would like to avoid because it's my work setup and I will have to set everything up from scratch.\nI have already searched many online articles and community posts but haven't been able to find anything similar to this situation. So my ask is that, could it really be a Hardware (RAM) related issue as the Genius bar tells me? or is there anything known that I may try (and that I haven't already tried as stated above) to see if it resolves the issue? \nAdded More info from system log-\nI ran sudo dmesg | more through terminal to view the last startup log immediately after a bootup and it seems in the beginning there are a bunch of kext related errors.

The interesting think about the damaged Firmware.scap file, is that evidently the file is copied from the /usr/standalone/i386 folder to the /volumes/efi/EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS folder at boot time. See web site: /Volumes/EFI - Firmware.scap & MBA41_0077_B12_LOCKED.scap. If this is true, then you should not have to worry about replacing the damaged Firmware.scap file.\nI suppose the next step would be to try and fix the EFI partition. If you wish, you could first backup this partition to a file. The file would be an exact image of the entire partition. To backup the entire EFI partition to the file named efi.binary, use the OS X command below. The partition should not be mounted, before entering the command.\nsudo dd if=/dev/disk0s1 of=efi.binary bs=409600\n\nIf something goes wrong, you can at least restore the EFI partition back to its original (faulty) condition. To restore the entire EFI partition from the file efi.binary, use the OS X command below. The partition should not be mounted, before entering the command.\nsudo dd if=efi.binary of=/dev/disk0s1 bs=409600\n\nThe OS X command to repair the partition is given below.\ndiskutil repairvolume disk0s1\n\nAn alternative would be to use Windows to run chkdsk on the EFI partition. From a Administrator Command Prompt window, you could enter the following commands.\nmountvol s: /s\nchkdsk /f s:\nmountvol s: /d\n\nMore information, about accessing the EFI partition from Windows, can be found at the web site: How do I mount the EFI partition on Windows 8.1 so that it is readable and writeable?\n\nA: You could try setting up an external drive with the same setup as your current drive. Then try to boot from that drive. That will at least tell you if the problem resides in your hard drive or not.\nAlso have you looked around for people having problems with EFI on your model macbook, regardless if they have a partition setup like yours or not? If you can't find many people that have had problems, then I would be skeptical about the genius bar. \n\nA: Today I've received my Macbook Pro 13inch 2015 back from Warranty and they have replaced I/O Board.

How could I run just 3 4K at 60hz? I am confused as to the best way to get 2 thunderbolt into 3 DisplayPort. I haven't picked out a specific monitor yet but they will be DisplayPort monitors. \nI have a 2015 MBP with the AMD graphics card.\nI am not interested in eGPU options. \n\nA: The way you connect more than 2 external displays to a MacBook (or any laptop for that matter) is to use USB display adapters like the StarTech USB 3.0 to 4K DisplayPort External Multi Monitor Video Graphics Adapter\n\nEach one of these adapters will function like a separate graphics card allowing you to hook up as many monitors as you have adapters.  So, to get your six external monitors, you can have two natively connected to your MacBook Pro and then you will need 4 of these adapters. \n*Note:  It's important to note that this setup is not for gaming.  These are not high performance external GPUs.  This is for connecting an additional display.  \nAdditionally, there are limitation with with OS X that will cause performance problems.  Some are limitations due to Apple, and others are limitations due to the driver.  Always check the Release Notes prior to purchase and/or installation.\nIf you're on a 2013 or later Mac Pro, you can natively connect 3 monitors without the need for special adapters.

My backup fits in 1.5TB, but Time Machine sometimes complains that it can't backup to the 1TB disk, because the space is not enough.\nCan I ask it to automatically select only some directories to back up, instead of failing to back up? I still want everything backed up to the 1.5TB disc.\nI'm not using the 1TB hard disc, anyway, so I would like to backup some data to it rather than none, in case both my computer and the 1.5TB hard disc fail.\n\nA: You can exclude items from a backup to save space on your backup disk, or to exclude items you back up using another method.\nChoose Apple menu > System Preferences, then click Time Machine.\nClick Options.\nClick the Add button , then select one or more items. You can also drag items to the list. To remove an item, select it, then click the Remove button . For example, you can exclude system files or the Applications folder from Time Machine backups using Time Machine preferences.\nThe backup disk is automatically included in the list of items that shouldn’t be backed up.\nClick Save.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH18847\nNotice how this setting is for both timemachine destinations though. Excluded files will (eventually) be deleted on both destinations.\n\nA: No, each Time Machine backup disk will backup the same set of items.\nFrom Apple Support page on using multiple backup disks:\n\nIf you designated items that shouldn’t be backed up, the list of excluded items applies to all backup disks.\n\nIf you feel that your backup is too large, you can exclude some unnecessary files from Time Machine backups, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Applications folder – apps store their data elsewhere, so you will still be backing up all application data.\n\n*The /System directory – contains system files for OS X, probably not data that you may need to have a copy of.\n\n", "Q: Does Time Machine take advantage of two backup disks to backup more fine-grained snapshots? I use Time Machine with two backup hard discs.\nDoes Time Machine create an identical copy of the data on both disks, or does it back up more fine-grained snapshots to different disks, so that I have more choices regarding the timestamp to restore to?\nLet's say, with only one disk, Time Machine backs up hourly snapshots — 4:00, 5:00, 6:00, etc. Does it back up snapshots taken at 4:30, 5:30, 6:30 to the second disk?\n\nA: Time Machine will continue to perform hourly backups, rotating through your backup drives. Each drive will contain a full, independent backup of your source drive.\nThis provides redundancy for your backup system, if that is what you seek. In case one of your backup drives fails, you still have another. This can prove particularly useful if you keep one of those backups offsite (backing over the Internet will require special setup, however, and can prove agonizingly slow).\nThe ability to use multiple backup drives was introduced starting with OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).\n", "Q: what is /usr/share/dict used for Where is this used, I read the README and it didn't say what program it was from, I do not think that it is the stock dictionary app because I tried some very obscure looking words that were in some of the files and they did not come up in the stock dictionary app. \nAny idea where this comes from?\n\nA: The origins go way back as a place holder for the dictionary words used by the spell utility. spell is not available but the program look will use the words dictionary.

However switching to \"Columns\" view (cmd-3) will allow you to open folder with one click.\nAlso it could be faster to just use hotkeys instead of trackpad/mouse.

I cannot reset it, erase the data and anything else. \nSo the question is does removing iPhone from \"Find my Phone\" remotely (online) logs off from iCloud?\nHow can I sign of from his iCloud and reset the phone? Erase it?\nThank you. \n\nA: Did you try restoring the phone using recovery mode?\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263\nThat should update the settings when it try and reactivate that its been removed from the former apple id.\n\nA: The canonical way to test is plug the phone into iTunes and restore it. The computer will retrieve lock status and let you know if the server side lock is present or reset. \nYou could also tap to the settings app on the iPhone and reset, erase all content and settings. That will need a wifi or cellular connection to verify the same server side lock status. \nThe article you linked has three very different scenarios - depending on which was employed, you might still not be done with that user.

Note, however, that the option won't show up in the bottom left corner until you actually connect your phone.\n\n\nA: If you set a system setting to disable all hot-plug events, you might need to remove those settings specifically or generally:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool NO\n\nor to just clear that key in the preferences \ndefaults -currentHost delete com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug\n\nAt that point, you should be able to go into Image Capture with the device connected and toggle the settings. I wonder if you have a connection issue if you don't see the device in ImageCapture - it should show up there once you have trusted the computer from the iOS device.

The times in the headers are consistent, that is, the chronological sequence is correct. The issue is that your mail client is not translating the time given in the header into local time for display.

I have a 5th generation AirPort Time Capsule (3TB) with an additional G-DRIVE GEN4 (3TB) external hard-drive attached to it. The external hard-drive has an on/off switch.\nIs it possible- and how can I make it so that the external hard-drive turns off or hibernates after a period of being idle, without turning off the power switch? I don't want it to be always active.\nThe external hard-drive is not used as a Time Machine backup drive; I'm only using it as a network share/network-attached storage, so that we can share files more easily within the household.\n\nA: Not possible.

I recently deleted all of my pictures and backed them up on an app called Shoebox. I did it to save space on my iPhone 6s. I decided it wasn't for me and everything was out place. It was making things complicated and I didn't want it anymore. I now have all my pictures backed up on the app, but don't know how to sync them all back. I don't know if it's possible, but if it isn't I was wondering if I could recover my recently deleted section? If I can, how do I do it?\n\nA: If you have a backup you had made before deleting those photos, you can restore from it and you would have all your photos. Restoring photos from the 'Recently deleted' section, however, is impossible as of now. \nYou can find more information about restoring from an iTunes or iCloud backup here.\n\nA: First you can see if you can still recover it from the \"Recently Deleted\" album in your Photos app? If you deleted all of those, the only way you can recover them is to export all your photos from Shoebox. Note that it won't be the original size (12 MP for 6S) if you took the free option, and will only be getting the 10.6 MP photos. If you are paying the $5 a month, you will get the full resolution of 12 MP.\nTo export these photos, log in and export your photos from: https://secure.shoeboxapp.com/export\nAfter export, throw them all in 1 folder, then you can sync that folder with iTunes.\nSee the Shoebox FAQ page. If you need more help, feel free to comment. :)\n\nA: There are two possibilities for iOS and deleted photos:\n\n\n*\n\n*If they are from your camera roll, you have no backup unless you sync the photos or have an iCloud or iTunes backup. There is an iCloud setting to automatically import all camera roll photos into Photos app - so check there too.\n\n*If the photos are in Photos app:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have iCloud photo library on - the deleted photos are in an album you can look at from any computer http://icloud.com/photos and from the devices signed into iCloud (macOS or iOS and possibly tvOS)\n\n*If you don't have iCloud photo library on - you need to have a device backup that you can restore to this or another device (same as if you were to restore files from camera roll backup).\n\n\n", "Q: Does factory unlock or GSM unlock mean I can put it on any service? I am planning to buy an iphone4 for my son for Christmas and was wondering if GSM unlocked or factory unlocked both mean that I can put the phone on any plan or service I like? Also,what do each specifically mean when buying a used or new phone?\n\nA: \nGSM Unlocked\n\nThe iPhone comes in two different models: GSM and CDMA. The GSM iPhone supports carriers including Cricket, AT&T, and T-Mobile. The CDMA iPhone supports carriers such as Sprint and Verizon. Buying a GSM Unlocked iPhone means that it is unable to support Sprint and Verizon and would not work with those carriers; a GSM iPhone works only with Cricket, AT&T, and T-Mobile. No single iPhone works with all the major carriers.\n\nFactory Unlocked\n\nBuying an unlocked iPhone means the contract it originally came with expired; it means you could put in any SIM card from any of the supported carriers on that iPhone. Whereas a locked iPhone is under contract with the carrier whose SIM card is in the phone, an unlocked iPhone is fully out of contract. Make sure it is GSM if you want Cricket, AT&T, or T-Mobile, or CDMA if you want Verizon or Sprint.\n\nAlso, a piece of advice: I highly recommend not purchasing an iPhone 4. Though it is definitely inexpensive, it is far out of date (about 5 years old, that's a  long time) and performance will be very poor. It hasn't received a software update in 3 years, and it is stuck on iOS 7 (iOS 10 is about to come out). It is a much better to fork over a bit extra for an iPhone 5C (still slow but not bad) or an iPhone SE (more expensive but definitely top-of-the-line, only $400). If you can't afford the iPhone 5C, I would recommend purchasing your son an inexpensive Android phone like the Blu R1 HD which is much faster than an iPhone 4, runs the latest version of Android, and is only $50.\n\nIf you need a phone that works with any carrier Go for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, or Nexus 6P. They come with all the bands needed (both GSM and CDMA) for Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, MetroPCS, US Cellular, Project Fi (a new low-cost carrier by Google), Cricket, and more.\n", "Q: How to downgrade macOS and restore settings from newer time machine I tried macOS Sierra and now I want to go back to El Capitan. I have backups from both OS versions on the drive but Time Machine is saying that I can't restore from that drive.\nHow do I restore my settings from Time Machine to El Capitan?\n\nA: I just had to boot the computer with the drive attached and holding the alt/option key. I picked the Time Machine drive to restore from and it actually let me choose an older backup to restore from. It conveniently labeled the OS versions as well. It wiped my drive and restored everything.\n\nA: In order to revert from macOS Sierra back to El Capitan you would need to wipe your startup drive because the Mac doesn't allow installing an OS older than the current version installed. After doing so, you can restore from a Time Machine backup made before upgrading to Sierra without a problem.\nMore in-depth guide here.\n", "Q: What is the X Server equivalent on OSX?

I employ the latest versions of both iOS and OS X. \nWhen I send SMS text messages from my iPhone to contacts who also use iPhones their replies arrive on the MacBook (in its Messages application) but not on the iPhone.\nI suspect this could be the case because those contacts have iMessages enabled and so their replies get routed by default to a device of mine which supports it as well (i.e. my MacBook but not the iPhone).\nIs there a way to remedy the situation without me having to enable iMessages on the iPhone? (I don’t care for iMessages over SMS and I would like to receive all text messages on the iPhone.)\n\nA: If their reply is in blue, it's an iMessage, and you disabled iMessage, so it won't come through. If the message is in green it is an SMS, which will always come through. The only way around it is to disable iMessage on all your devices so that your friends' iPhones don't pick you up as iMessage-enabled contact and hopefully send you SMS instead of iMessage. If the iMessage didn't went through they can touch and hold the blue message and tap \"Send as text message\" to send as SMS.\nSo the solutions are to enable or disable iMessage on all your devices. I'll go with enable, because you have nothing to lose and makes life easier for everyone and yourself.\nIf you really don't want to enable iMessage on your phone, at least narrow down the emails/numbers where one can get to you.

See the Apple web site \"Use Windows 10 on your Mac with Boot Camp\" for details.\nIf apple does not official support your model Mac, you may still be able to install Windows 10. Here are some thoughts.\nWhile editing the Info.plist file may allow you to create the USB Windows 10 installer, usually the same computer can not boot the installer from the USB drive. If you can, then your computer is one of the few exceptions. \nIf you have a working optical drive, then this would make the best choice to install from. I would recommend burning the iso file to a RW DVD. This takes longer to burn, but the DVD is reusable.  \nWhen possible, you should use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" to a flash drive. If you can not, then download and use the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" for Windows 7. The correct version for your Mac can be found at the Apple web site \"Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp\". \nIf you use an older version of the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" to install, you made need the set the Compatibility Mode. Right click on Setup.exe to set the appropriate mode.\nMost likely you will not be able to install using a EFI boot method. Even if you succeed in installing, usually some of the hardware will not function correctly. (For example, sound will not work.)\nThe best chance at success will be to install using the legacy BIOS boot method. This requires you to partition the installation drive using a hybrid GPT/MBR partition scheme. This usually is accomplished by using the Boot Camp Assistant or using the Disk Utility to format (via Erase) the 4th partition as MS-DOS (FAT). (This is the partition assigned the identifier disk0s4.) After booting to the Windows 10 installer, you will need to NTFS format this partition in order to complete the installation of Windows.\nIf you use the Startup Manager to boot the Windows 10 installer, then you should choose the icon with the label \"Windows\". This selects the BIOS boot method. The icon labeled \"EFI boot\" selects a EFI boot method. Again, I recommend you avoid EFI boot method installations. You invoke the Startup Manager by holding down the option key when you turn on or restart your Mac.\nSome users have reported problems getting the wireless keyboard to work during the installation process. The Windows installer does offer a \"on screen\" keyboard which can be temporarily substituted for the physical keyboard. You can pair the wireless keyboard after Windows 10 installs.\nIt is possible that your computer will boot back to OS X, before the installation of Windows completes. If this happens, then open the \"Startup Disk\" pane of the \"System Preferences\" application, select the icon labeled \"Windows\" and click on the \"Restart\" button. The installation of Windows will continue.\n", "Q: Mac Numbers - How do I add up cells containing data (text) per column In my Mac Numbers Spreadsheet, I have got a column containing a product title.

The test condition must be enclosed in quotes, and usually you're going to want to specify a comparison operator.

I've been browsing for an hour and I can't find any specific buyer guides or websites that sell Mac compatible memory (in the EU).\nAccording to Apple's RAM specs, I managed to find this:  PCPartPicker.com\nThis is what the Apple specs say:\n\n\n*\n\n*PC3-14900\n\n*Unbuffered\n\n*Nonparity\n\n*204-pin\n\n*1867MHz DDR3 SDRAM\n\n\nSource: Install memory in an iMac\n\nA: You will need two \"16GB Kits\" (four 8GB modules in total) to get the full 32GB.  I have personally done this in my 2012 iMac 27\"\n\nThe memory that I recommend is Crucial 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR3L - PN# CT2K8G3S186DM\nI recommend Crucial because they are very reliable and they have a lifetime warranty.  There are brands that are cheaper, but (IMO) it's simply not worth the cost savings.  I have found that not only is the quality better (fewer failures with lifetime warranted memory versus non-lifetime warranted)  the customer service has always been much \"stronger\" in terms of getting faulty memory replaced.\n\nA: I usually buy any branded memory with the same pins and MHz and it always work. But there are brand names that manufacture for Apple products, like OWC.

In description of this app in app store has been written it can resume download from broken point, now i have tried to download 2 or 3 files with this app, when download was interrupted and we click start , it start download from first start point.\nPlease help how this app works? \n\nA: No one can really answer this question except the developer, it will just be opinion based. So here is my opinion:\nThis is a developer issue, you can review the app and tell them about this bug. This app doesn't have a support page in English so I doubt you will get support from them directly.\nHere is an alternative app that can resume downloads:\nDownloads Free | Downloads\nPlease note that this app can not save video files any more, that's why the current version has 1 star rating. But other than that, it's perfect! :)\n", "Q: How can I generate iOS screenshots without using a simulator? I'm not too far off from releasing my first Cordova-based iOS / Android app. The final step is to upload screenshots of my app in various resolutions (e.g. one to show how it looks on iPhone 6 Plus, one for iPhone 4 etc.).\nI have an iPhone 4, and a 2009 Macbook with 2gb of RAM in it (both second hand from eBay. I just needed the bare minimum for development purposes), so running a simulator is painfully slow and takes a long time to do most things\nIs there a quick and easy way to prepare the 20 or so screenshots I need without having to own or get access to various sized iPhones, or struggle through the simulator? I'm looking for something I can use fairly often as I release new versions so I don't have to struggle every time.\n\nA: A popular solution to this problem is  this  automation tool called snapshot. It is apart of a suite of tools made to automate iOS and Android developments. \nFor relatively small applications though, the simulator isn't too bad. \n\nA: If you developed your app using Cordova - you might be able to use a web browser to automate screen generation\nAnd it looks like he just updated his post to talk about generating screenshots using Firefox. Even gives a node.js script someone can use to automatically sort out the images into folders. \nI just tried it out on my app and it worked!\nAll you need to do is install Firefox and turn on the responsive mode in the developer tools. Then you can set your resolution, set the zoom to 200% and use the screenshot button to take a shot that meets Apple's guidelines.\nAwesome!\n\nA: I'm afraid that is the only way. Unless you want to open the app on a 6 Plus and Photoshop all the images smaller for each device (app for that), which is a very horrible idea but the only one I can think of accomplishing this without the simulator.\nTo make it easier to do the screenshots, instead of pressing ctrl+alt+C then bring it into Photoshop, you can now just cmd+S and the screenshot will be saved to your desktop ready to drag and drop into iTunes Connect. Make sure your device scale is on 100%:\nSimulator -> Window -> Pixel Accurate (Cmd 3)\n", "Q: App no longer available in store. Transfer from old iPhone to new iPhone? I have an app on my iPhone 4S called 7 Second Diet. It is no longer available on the app store. Luckily, it is still available on my iPhone 4S.\nTwo days ago, I bought a iPhone 6S. The transfer process was relatively painless. Everything copied across, and all the apps started downloading, except 7 Second Diet.\nI still have the app on my iPhone 4S. I am looking for a way to transfer it to my new iPhone 6S.\niTunes used to let you save your apps to your Mac, but they have removed this feature in iTunes 12.4.1.\n\nWith iOS 9 or later, apps will not sync or transfer to iTunes via Transfer Purchases. If you would like to download your apps to your iTunes library, make sure to turn on Automatic Downloads for your iTunes purchases. You can also download past purchases. Source.\n\nI tried a third party solution called iMazing and while this allowed me to copy the 7 Second Diet app off my iPhone 4S and onto my Mac as an .imazingapp file, it was unable to copy the app to my iPhone 6S. It gave a message saying I had to download the app from the app store to the phone before restoring it.\nI also tried the download your past purchases technique in iTunes 12.4.1, but the app does not show up there either.\nDoes anyone have any solutions? Most solutions I can find only, including here on the Apple Stack Exchange, are out of date and not compatible with iTunes 12.4.1.\n\nA: After a hideous amount of time and effort, I finally found a way to get my apps that are \"no longer available on the App Store\" and do not show up under \"Purchased\" from my old iPad to my new iPad Pro.\nIt requires that you have backed up your computer over the past few years, or at least one year.\nEnsure that your iPad is not plugged into iTunes. Close itunes.\nFind your backup. \nIn Finder, search \".ipa\". (Note: just searching for the app name.ipa does not always work, nor will searching for the iTunes mobile applications folder always display the .ipa files within it. No idea why.)\nLocate the .ipa file for your missing app or apps.\nCopy them to a new and accessible folder.\nOpen iTunes. Click Library.\n\"Drag and drop\" your .ipa file INTO the field of app icons. They should copy over.\nNow plug iPad in to your computer.\nClick on the little device icon to open up your device in iTunes.\nClick Apps.\nThe list should now include your missing app.\nEither drag it onto your Homescreen on the righthand panel, or change the app's button to \"Will Install\".\nClick DONE.\nDialog appears: \"You've changed settings... apply?\" Click APPLY.\nApps should now be installed on your device!\nIf only a few of your apps install, and you get an \"Could not sync xx number of apps\" error, disconnect and do a hard reboot of your device (hold both buttons down), restart and reconnect. Check in iTunes that things have not been reordered; reposition if necessary, then click DONE-APPLY again.\nRelated things I have discovered, to my dismay:\nApple is culling older apps off the App Store at an alarming rate - three times as many last month than ever before. Back up your apps now, separately!\nItunes no longer saves your full app, so it is up to you to do so manually.\nIn Setting-About on the iPad, a list shows on the left supposedly of all the apps installed on your device. THIS IS NOT ACCURATE. I did a spotlight search and found dozens of other apps that were actually installed, but not showing in that list! Some of them had icons on the screens, too. \nFurther, when I did a restore from the older iPad to the newer one, the newer iPad not only did not list every app that ended up installed, but some apps that did NOT SHOW IN THE LIST AS INSTALLED on the old iPad DID install on the new one, verified by Spotlight search! The moral: do NOT rely on that list!\nSome older apps that started with a symbol of digit have been renamed with it spelled out. Adjust your search to that. Example: #photos is now Hashphotos.\nSome older apps were discarded and started anew by the developer, with a similar but not identical name. Find the name of the developer for your app and search as to what other apps they have made. You may find the newer version, and if it requires payment, sometimes contacting the developer and telling them you have the old one that won't work now will result in them sending you access.\nSome older apps do things that Apple is not allowing anymore. In some cases, by installing the oldest .ipa version you can find in your backups restores its original functions... if you are lucky.\nIf you do manage to install some very old apps on your new device, they may not work well, or may just plain crash. No guarantees.\nNo app icon showing up on the device, yet Spotlight Search finds it? You may have all your Homescreens filled up to capacity. There is a limit (20 pages, I believe; do not quote me on that). If this is the case, apps WILL install, but the icons themselves are \"hidden\". Once you group apps into folders and free up spots for icons, they will one by one appear.\nI hope this helps someone, and you do not have to go through what I did to learn all of this from scratch!\n\nA: So after about an hour research I came up with this:\niTunes on Mac doesn't show previous purchases where iPhone does. BUT, it will only show if the developer is still active, if he has renewed his license or has other apps on the AppStore. So if he is active, you should still be able to download this app from AppStore -> Updates -> Purchased. But after a long research, I found out that it was developed by Aaron Block, and he is currently not active on AppStore, and his website has also expired. So you won't be able to redownload this app. \nMy source: I am a developer with expired license and can't find my own apps in previous purchased items where I could find apps like Downloads by Hian Zin Jong, and Trapster by Trapster.com which is removed from the AppStore but the developers are active (or renewed their yearly license).\nSolutions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your iPhone 4S, then restore it onto your iPhone 6S via cable on iTunes. \n\n*Contact the developer and ask if he has the ipa, or project to build or to bring it back.\n\n\nI can't think of anything else. Don't know if an earlier version of iTunes would work?\n\nA: Actually iMazing software saved my day and for free!\nI was successful at retrieving the app, which was no longer available in AppStore, from an iOS 11 iPhone via Mac and installing the same app via another PC remotely using .amazingapp saved file.\n\nA: This guy from YouTube explained everything you need to do in order to download a specific app using iMazing app! You just need a laptop and your old device with that app.\nhttps://youtu.be/bP5kXX7AIu4\n", "Q: alias can't be opened This is about a MacBook running on 10.10.5 whose disk has recently been repaired (to try to solve the present issue) using Disk Utility.

Whenever I connect to the device with an AFP connection, the drive connects with no issues, and I can browse files and folders with ease. After a while though, Yosemite decides to mount another version of the NAS using SMB. This SMB connection is riddled with issues; folder names show off an old 8.3 NTFS name, and sometimes they cannot be changed.\nHow can I stop my Mac from connecting an additional SMB connection the NAS?\n\nA: Clear your login credentials out of your keychain.\nFor instance, on my Synology Diskstation NAS, I have the following saved for SMB:\n\nOnce you delete it, OS X will no longer try to connect to the share.\n", "Q: Why are some apps keep running in OS X even if I quit them? At least three apps are now doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In its menu, I click on quit\n\n*It starts quiting but\n\n*then never finish quiting. \n\n\nI can switch to it. The icon in the dock bar shows it is running.

It is puzzling. \n\nA: It is due to bugs. Most likely in those programs, or in the OS X system. Essentially the program never completes the \"Quit\" action, so it doesn't exit and thus stays running.\nAnother cause could be hardware error - such as a non-responding hard drive. If that was the case, you would be seeing problems everywhere and not just with the Quit menu option in a few programs.\nIf you want to investigate the specific cause on your machine, I would suggest using dtruss to see what system calls the application makes as you hit quit. It could for example be hanging waiting for a mutex/semaphore, or similar - suggesting a deadlock or livelock. In other words, a bug.\n", "Q: Cannot mount USB with anything, including Disk Utility I am trying to connect a USB to a Mac I am using, and i cannot seem to.  When i plug the device into the Mac, i get an error that reads 'The disk inserted is not readable by the computer.(It contains an Ubuntu live boot)  This is interesting as i was able to plug it in before and it worked, including when it had those files in it.\nI see the usb in the Disk Utilities menu, but when I click 'mount', it does nothing to it, and when i try to verify it, it says to repair the disk, but that option is blanked out.  When I try to clear the USB of the files, it says that it can't connect to the device.\nIs there any way i can mount or access the device so that i can copy files to this?  I can't use another USB as i don't have another one to use for this.\n\nA: I'm guessing the drive is in a filesystem that is either not supported by Mac or corrupted. First, you should connect the drive, open Terminal and type\ndiskutil list\n\nThen you'll see a few disks (shown similar to /dev/disk1) and their name and size. Based on their name/size, locate which one is the problematic drive and edit your question to include it's entry.\nBut either way, the case is probably that the drive is just not formatted so good. Mac can be really picky sometimes when it comes to disks, so I really recommend you try to burn the ISO onto the drive using Rufus. Rufus is an incredible tool which is also completely free, but unfortunately it's only available for Windows. So try to get yourself one (or maybe ask a friend to allow you to use his) so you can use this tool, then just open Rufus, choose your disk in the drop-down menu (make sure you choose the right disk!!), check the box saying \"Create bootable disk\" and click the disk button, choose you ubuntu ISO, and hit format. I use Rufus a lot and it hasn't failed me yet.\n", "Q: Can't get Alt (Option) key to work while remote controlling a Mac from Windows with VNC The setup: I'm using Windows 10, 8, 8.1 and 7 with a international keyboard, US keyboard, Windows keyboard, PC keyboard with VNC client TighVNC, RealVNC, UltraVNC to remote control a iMac, Mac mini, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, running OS X, with Screen Sharing activated as the VNC server.\nThe problem 1: My keyboard mapping is all wrong, can't input Alt key(Option ⌥ ). It is identified as Command key ⌘ .\nThe problem 2: My keyboard is international and a lot of the keys are wrongly mapped.\n\nA: Problem 1) Use RealVNC client. In my experience, alt (Option) is in the Windows Key and Command is in the alt. Check out the documentation here https://www.realvnc.com/docs/mac-keyboard-mapping.html \nThere is no fix for the alt (Option) key on TightVNC.\nI tried to use software on the Mac to remap / change the keys functionality such as Karabiner (previously called KeyboardRemap4Macbook), Seil and even the native system Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys to change ctrl for alt or capslock for alt , but it seems that when on VNC, those configurations are ignored. It's like a different keyboard is being used and it doesn't show up in the Select keyboard menu, only the local one.\nProblem 2) VNC for some reason treats your keyboard as it were an US keyboard. You'll have to change in windows, the layout of your keyboard to US international, and by doing this, almost all your keys are going to be mapped correctly in the Mac. You can set different keyboard layout for different applications.\nI registered a issue on TightVNC sourceforge account about this, but the project seems to be dead, so no hope. Same problem happens on RealVNC.\nFor those keys that are still missing / dead a workaround is to use the Character map (while editing a text press Ctrl + alt + space-bar or at the menu select Edit > Emoji & Symbols )\nAlternative is to use a different remote desktop solution. If it's for personal use, go for TeamViewer. I tried and it's a lot better, with full support for the keyboard, better connection, imagem, etc,\nBut if it's for business / comercial use, Teamviewer's price is just ridiculous IMO. The cheapest license called 'Business' cost U$ 749.\n\nA: I can't speak to the international keyboard but I just tried this solution and it worked for a US keyboard. I'm on a PC with a 104-key US keyboard running Windows 10 and TightVNC Viewer into a Mac running El Capitan and stuck on the upgrade to High Sierra with \"About a minute remaining\" for the last 12 hours and hit Alt-R-L to simulate Command-L and the log opened right up for me:\nTL;DR: Opt key is mapped to AltR on US-PC kb and AltGr on non-US PC kb\n", "Q: How do I prevent my Mac from autocorrecting my username?

The only problem is that we don't get International calling.\nSo I want my gf to be able to use data to void call family on their iphones.\nBut I don't know anything about apple, so I am not sure what is the best method. What is important is that it uses data and does not default to the cellular system and cost us mucho denairo!!\n\nA: Am I missing something obvious here or can you just use FaceTime Audio? Obviously it won't work if you use the keypad, but you can call from anywhere you have their contact card (Contacts, Phone, Messages, FaceTime, even Mail...)\nYou did say both parties have iDevices, right?\n\nA: I don't know of any way to force a call to use data instead of cellular minutes, or everyone would be doing it. \nOne option you have is to enable Wi-Fi calling. If you are logged into a wi-fi network, you can make calls using the wi-fi. Go to Settings > Phone > Calls: Wi-Fi Calling and switch it to ON. Not every carrier allows this, so if the setting isn't there, obviously you can't use it.\nYou can also use Google Voice for free. You could probably get a number local to your Canadian origination and still be able to call home while you're on the road. Skype calling has a similar option. Both have apps for the iPhone.\nIt was brought to my attention that you can also use FaceTime audio (as the other answer suggests).

I have OS X Yosemite. \nAs far as I understand, RansomWhere just warns me whenever an app tries to encrypt data. It's up to the user to judge whether they trust a process or not. (And whether the application is one which should need to encrypt data.) The user is given the choice of Allow or Terminate each time there is a warning. It has warned me about several apps I trust and that I figure did need to encrypt data, and I have simply clicked Allow.\nHowever, just now I got a warning about a process I don't know what was. The message said \"is encrypting data\", so I figuredd I had to hurry, so I just clicked Terminate immediately after seeing that I wasn't sure what the process actually was. After clicking Terminate, the dialogue box disappeared, and I heard nothing more from RansomWhere regarding the issue.\nNow, I want to know what this process actually was and what was going on. I don't remember the details given in the message, just that I wasn't sure which process it was. I wish I would have taken a second to take a screenshot before pressing Terminate, but unfortunately, I didn't.\nHow can I find out which process this was and what was going on?\n\nA: According to RansomWhere's own site the data is stored in \n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/RansomWhere/installedApps.plist - a list of applications already present on the system.  \n\n*/Library/RansomWhere/approvedBinaries.plist - a list of binaries explicitly approved by the user.  \n\n*/Library/RansomWhere/whitelist.plist - a list of safe binaries (that often legitimately create encrypted files).  \n\n*/Library/RansomWhere/graylist.plist - a list of system binaries that are not explicitly trusted.  \n\n\nHowever, because an app that was terminated is by design not remembered, it will not appear in any list.\n\nThe following list summarizes the 'allow' and 'terminate' actions  \n  \n  \n*\n  \n*'allow'   Tells RansomWhere? it's ok to let the process continue running. This will be persistently remembered; you'll never be alerted\n  about this binary again.\n  \n*'terminate'   Tells RansomWhere? to kill the process. As this action is a little more drastic, RansomWhere?, (by design) will not remember\n  such actions. Thus if the terminated process is ran again, it will\n  cause another alert.\n\nYou could check Console to see whether it generated an event at the time - I can't test that as I've never run RansomWhere.\n", "Q: How do I tell Siri to show me pictures I took at a state park rather than pictures of the state park from the Web?

When I say \"Show me pictures I took at XYZ State Park\", the Photos app pulls up and displays nothing.\nHowever, the photos come up when I ask for photos I took within the state.\n\nA: I just tested on my iPhone when I tried searching for photos that I snapped at the Brooklyn Bridge Park by asking Siri \"Search photos for Brooklyn Bridge Park\" and it opened the photos app and filtered out showing me only those photos.\n\nA: Sounds like the location data for your state park pictures doesn't contain the name of the place but just your geographical location. This could be because you didn't have access to the internet at the park so iOS could not retrieve a name for your location, and instead relied on GPS to get your geographical location (which is why asking Siri for pictures from the state works).\nTo modify the location of a photo to include \"XYZ State Park\", you can view and edit location data in the Photos app on OS X (tutorial on osxdaily.com).\n", "Q: What happened to my imported music?

I have two sperate Apple ID accounts as I had to factory reset my phone, I created a new one a few months ago. My first Apple ID (before the factory reset) can connect with iCloud, but not the App Store - there is a problem with this one about billing on it but I've never purchased anything only free apps, so it doesn't let me update any apps or my phone software. After the factory reset my second Apple ID works with the App Store, but I'm not able to access iCloud because of my security questions (can't reset them either :(). & I would like to have all my music & pictures on there. So I was wondering if there was a way to keep the first Apple ID logged into my iCloud & the second Apple ID logged into my iTunes & App Store? \nAnything would be helpful! Thanks \n\nA: There are instructions on how to set this up on Apple's support site, see towards the end of https://support.apple.com/HT204053.\nBasically you open Settings on your iOS device and\n\n\n*\n\n*configure/use one AppleID to log into iCloud \n\n*configure/use the other ID to log into iTunes & App Store\n\n\nHaving said that, I would still recommend to address the issues you have with your current account. To verify your billing details, log into the Store and update your information (if it doesn't work in the iOS device, you can use any computer running iTunes for this, just don't forget to log out within iTunes afterwards); to recover your second account, start with https://iforgot.apple.com/.\n", "Q: Unable to find the backed up photos in iCloud I had an iPad mini which had some valuable photos in the Photos app. I had backed up the device on iCloud using 4.2 GB of my available 5 GB of space. Now that device is dead and is beyond repair. I thought I had the backup in iCloud and didn't take care to backup anywhere else. Now when I open iCloud, I see that it is completely blank. Is there any policy Apple has to delete the backup after a certain amount of time? Is there any hope for recovering these photos?\n\nA: Why your photos are not in iCloud Photos\n\nNow when I open iClould I see its completely blank.\n\nPhotos do not appear on iCloud.com unless iCloud Photo Library was turned on; from your description, it seems that it is not turned on: that is why the Photos section of iCloud is completely blank. You evidently did not have iCloud Photo Library turned on, so photos were tied to your device backup instead of being tied to your iCloud Drive. Thus, your photos are not visible from your iCloud account. But have no fear, that doesn't mean you can't access your photos.\n\nHow to get your photos back\nYou'll need a new/used iPad that runs iOS 7 or later (so iPad 2 or later, iPad Mini 1 or later). You can buy a relatively inexpensive used iPad Mini 1st gen here for ~$150, or upgrade to an iPad Mini 4th gen (the latest and greatest) here for ~$350. Make sure the iPad you purchase has at least as much storage space as your lost iPad before you buy it. (Note: Apple may offer to exchange your dead iPad if you contact their support team at getsupport.apple.com)\nWhen first launching the iPad (if it's used, you must do a factory reset first if it still has data on it), follow these steps to set it up from a backup of your lost iPad Mini:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn on the new iPad.\n\n*From the Apps & Data screen, tap Restore from iCloud Backup, then sign-in to your iCloud account.\n\n*Proceed to “Choose backup,” then choose from a list of available backups in iCloud (probably just choose the latest backup).\nAfter following these steps, your new iPad will boot up and have all of the data from your lost iPad Mini, including all of your photos.\n\nWhat to do to prevent this next time\nI recommend using the Google Photos app to seamlessly back up all of your photos/videos (free of charge, unlimited photos and videos). With Google Photos, you can access the backed-up photos/videos anytime on almost any device (including from the web at photos.google.com). Or, you can turn on Apple's iCloud Photo Library, in Settings -> iCloud -> Photos, which lets you access the photos anytime from icloud.com. (Note that iCloud Photo Library eats up your iCloud storage space and isn't free or unlimited like Google Photos is.)\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance, and please let me know whether this helped you or not!\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple's guide to restoring an iPad/iPhone from a backup\n\n*iCloud Photo Library info\n\n*iMore's guide to iCloud Photo Library\n\nA: You can restore your backup to another iOS device to recover your photos, if they were included in your original iCloud backup.\nYou can find detailed instructions on this Apple Support page: Restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch from a backup\n\nA: From iCloud: iCloud storage and backup overview:\n\nHere’s what iCloud backs up:\n[…]\n\n*\n\n*Photos and videos on your iOS devices\n\n*\n\n*However, if you turn on iCloud Photo Library on your iOS device (iOS 8.1 or later) or Mac (OS X v10.10.3 or later), your photos and videos are already stored in iCloud, so they aren’t included in your iCloud backup.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that if you have both iCloud Backups and iCloud Photo Library turned on, your photos are \"backed up\" to iCloud but they are not duplicated in the device backup (to save your iCloud storage).\nThis also means that if you have iCloud Backups turned on, but iCloud Photo Library turned off, your photos should be included in the device backup, but not as browsable Photos.\nIn any case this means: if you have iCloud Backups turned on, your photos should be backed up into iCloud in some form.\nHow these scenarios differ can be demonstrated by logging in to www.icloud.com:\n\n*\n\n*If you have iCloud Photo Library turned on, you can browse your photos via Photos app\n\n*If it is turned off, then they are in the device backup and not browsable via Photos app — so when you restore your backup they should go into your device's Photos app just as they were.\n\nYou can confirm that backup is consuming your iCloud storage via the Settings app (on icloud.com).\n", "Q: Apple.ca accepts answer, Apple ID app/ iCloud doesn't? how can Apple.ca accept my answers for security questions but when I type them into the set up for iCloud their wrong??

Problem :( I forgot.ca doesn't help either \n\nA: If one web app works and another doesn't you would probably need to contact support to determine if the problem is with your account or with Apple's infrastructure. \nAlso, you will want to be sure you are really connecting to Apple sites (some computers and networks are compromised by malicious software).

Is this possible at all, to have an older version of OS X installed on an external device?\n\nA: If you have the Mavericks install app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the Install OS X Mavericks.app file to your desktop\n\n*Insert the flash drive you want the installation files to be copied to\n\n*Download this script, unzip it, then move the osx_10.9_bootable.sh file to your Desktop.\n\n*Open Terminal app, then type cd ~/Desktop/ and hit enter\n\n*Then type sh osx_10.9_bootable.sh and follow instructions then wait\n\n\nIf this was successful, restart your Mac and hold down the Option key then select the newly created installation drive to install Mavericks onto your external HDD.\n\n\n(in this case, 0553225513 is my external hdd, which will be your flash drive)\nAfter the installation you can reinstall OS X El Capitan on your Macbook.\n", "Q: 2 iPads - does that mean double storage? I'm just wondering: if I have two iPads, can I choose which apps go on each of the iPads. The memory is almost full on both. I hope I've explained this clearly.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. I assume you're using the same Apple ID on both iPads (otherwise it isn't an issue at all). Go to the Settings app and choose iTunes & App Store. In the Automatic Downloads section, disable the switch next to 'Apps'. Once you've done this, apps will no longer automatically be installed on this iPad if you install them on the other.\n\n", "Q: iPad App that loads website This is a general question about iPad apps.\nWe have a conference coming up where we want to use some iPads and have an app that only displays our website. \nSo pretty much safari – though minus a browser/url bar and minus pinching / zoom so it functions like an app, without letting users navigate away to any other domains.\nFrom what I understand there is no point trying to develop a site specific app that just displays a website because understandably, the apple store doesn't want that kind of stuff in it's store. \nI just need something that acts like a shell.\nThoughts?\n\nA: Sure, theres a thing called Guided Access, you can \"crop\" the area where they may not touch, anything in that zone wont work if tapped, and if you tap the home button they will be asked to enter a passcode.\nTo enable this:\nSettings -> General -> Accessibility -> Guided Access\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Guided Access\n\n*Set a passcode at Passcode Settings\n\n*Enable Accessibility Shortcut\n\n\nNow go into Safari, press home button 3 times, start Guided Access, then draw a block on the address bar and the toolbar at the bottom.

If the process hangs on a particular step, then this is likely the issue, the remedy for which may be varied.\nAlternatively, using the key combination command S immediately after the computer chimes, will grant you command-line access to the machine.

IMovie is mostly a 'canned' software, I am limited to presets for the most part. I understand that there are a few workarounds to adding custom effects (creating 2d video with green background, or images with opacity etc.); however, I would like to create custom transitions/titles/filters that are recognized by iMovie and treated the same as built-in effects. I am exploring a few options:\nOption A: design & import\nThere might be a way to import my designs to iMovie in a way that I am currently unaware of. If such options exist, please let me know what file type I need to do such.\nEssentially, I want to see if iMovie can function like Final Cut Pro does  with Motion 5 as I am working on a budget and can't spend money for this function.\n\nA: Your best bet is reverse engineering the existing Transitions if you investment in time costs less than the $50 for Motion which is the official tool for making custom transition effects.\nLook in /Applications/iMovie.app/Contents/PlugIns/MediaProviders/MotionEffect.fxp/Contents/Resources/Templates.localized/Transitions.localized and the transition file is simply an xml file with the .motr file extension:\n$ head Pan\\ Down\\ Slow.motr \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE ozxmlscene>\n<ozml version=\"5.5\">\n\n<displayversion>5.0.5</displayversion>\n\n<factory id=\"1\" uuid=\"046e7c74fd734809885d35e99ac9eeb2\">\n    <description>Channel</description>\n    <manufacturer>Apple</manufacturer>\n    <version>1</version>\n\nAlso, you could hire someone that has paid for Motion to make a trivial transition and test that it works for your needs.

I've been using Time Machine to backup my MacBook Pro to my local OS X Server for years, but I recently started getting errors when attempting to backup. When running either an automatic or manual backup, I receive notification that the system couldn't complete the backup. After examining Console logs I'm seeing the following error from the NetAuthSysAgent process:\nERROR: AFP_OpenSession - Login failed with 80 \n\nAdditionally, the com.apple.backupd process is reporting an authentication error, and hints at System keychain problems:\nAuthentication error (80) - the correct user or password info may not exist in the System.keychain or the server may no longer allow access for this user.\n\nI've confirmed that a keychain item exists in the System keychain for this connection, and that the keychain item should be functional (its type is Time Machine Password, it contains the correct password; Access Control for the item is always allowed for NetAuthSysAgent).\nI've tried to remove the backup disk and re-add it through the TimeMachine System Preference. This seems to add the correct item into the System keychain, but the system still won't perform backup.\nI've attempted to set the correct destination manually by performing the following command (trying the server's DNS name, IP address, and mDNS name without success):\nsudo tmutil setdestination -p afp://USER@SERVER/TimeMachine\n\nEach time that command runs, I can confirm that the correct Keychain Item is being created in the System keychain (but the system continues to provide the error mentioned above).\nLastly, manually connecting to the network share that hosts my Time Machine backup works normally, and my account has \"Full Control\" of files in this share.\nHow can I get my network Time Machine backups to work again?\n\nA: I found an answer on the Ars Technica forum, which helped to get the issue resolved: http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?t=1225417\nThe file at /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist contained the following text:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n   <key>DLDBSearchList</key>\n   <array/>\n   <key>SecItemSynchronizable</key>\n   <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nIt was necessary to remove the DLDBSearchList key and array from that file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n   <key>SecItemSynchronizable</key>\n   <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nAfter removing that entry, Time Machine network backups are working normally (as NetAuthSysAgent is now able to locate the correct System keychain item).\n", "Q: How can I use an ssh key with a passphrase but not have to type the passphrase every time when working in a remote shell? Here's my situation:\nI ssh into a server running OS X, and from that remote shell I want to perform pushes and pulls (via ssh) for a git repository whose local copy exists on this server and whose origin is on another server out in the internet. (In this specific case it's a bitbucket repo.) I have generated an ssh public/private key pair with a passphrase on the server and uploaded the public key to bitbucket.\nOrdinarily when I would perform pushes and pulls on my local OS X system, I would do it through a window in Terminal.app, and I use OS X's keychain to handle my ssh passphrase so that I only have to type it in once per login session. But that doesn't work here because I'm working in a remote session.\nIs there any way to not have to type in my passphrase every time, other than using a public/private key pair with no passphrase?\n\nA: The solution is called ssh-agent. It can remember your passphrase for the session. You run the agent with\neval `ssh-agent`\n\n(might be even running in your session already, so check before using ssh-add -l) and add the key to the agent using:\nssh-add /path/to/your-private-key\n\nit will prompt you for a passphrase. The further connections using this key will not prompt you for the passphrase.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra GDB not codesigned First I should note that I'm using macOS Sierra (version 10.12 beta 16A238m), but I don't think it's that different than El Capitan in this certain situation (but I guess you know more than I do about that, or I wouldn't be here right now asking this question).\nSo I installed GDB (The GNU Debugger) for following among a book I am currently reading (\"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation\"), which only explains how to use GDB, so I can't use LLDB. I installed it using Homebrew (brew install gdb), and everything worked fine. Until I used it.\nI compiled my C source code using clang -g hello_word.c -o hello_world (it's just a simple C \"Hello, World!\" program), and then I run gdb -q hello_world, and here's the session:\nChens-MacBook-Pro:C chenjian$ gdb -q hello_world\nReading symbols from hello_world...Reading symbols from /Users/chenjian/Documents/Coding/Projects/RandomDev/C/hello_world.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/hello_world...done.\ndone.\n(gdb) list\n1   #include <stdio.h>\n2   \n3   int main() {\n4       printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n5   }\n(gdb) break main\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x100000f6f: file hello_world.c, line 4.\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /Users/chenjian/Documents/Coding/Projects/RandomDev/C/hello_world \nUnable to find Mach task port for process-id 42492: (os/kern) failure (0x5).\n (please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8))\n\nSo I googled a bit about codesigning, and found this. So I went through the instructions (except for the ones for Snow Leopard), and it still doesn't work! Anyone knows how I can make it work?\n\nA: Yes, code signing should work is a substantially better alternative to disabling SIP. I can't really believe how often disabling SIP is suggested as a solution to this problem - if you get desperate I'd sooner advise running sudo gdb (have backups!) than disabling SIP.\nFor me, the problem was that I repeatedly messed up one or more steps in the procedure. I ended up doing brew reinstall gdb, deleting all the certificates I had created, rebooting and then very carefully following the procedure again. Note that when you install gdb with Homebrew, the following is shown:\n==> Caveats\ngdb requires special privileges to access Mach ports.\nYou will need to codesign the binary. For instructions, see:\n\n  https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/BuildingOnDarwin\n\nOn 10.12 (Sierra) or later with SIP, you need to run this:\n\n  echo \"set startup-with-shell off\" >> ~/.gdbinit\n\nThose instructions were what worked for me on Sierra. Disabling startup-with-shell so far has not been necessary, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're sure that you did it all correctly and the troubleshooting section of the link is of no use.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot to recovery\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*type csrutil disable\nThen restart. dtrace and gdb should work.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html\nYou could also run a script to determine which parts of SIP are enabled if you enable it with exclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/rtrouton/rtrouton_scripts/tree/master/rtrouton_scripts/check_system_integrity_protection_status\nOne nice thing is you don't need to relax SIP if you choose to use lldb and can compile your code with Xcode. Since gdb is not signed by Apple - it's intentionally prevented from attaching to anything on the system by design.\n", "Q: El Capitan Installer consistently corrups HFS+ superblock The standard, non-beta El Capitan installer corrupts the HFS+ superblock, and states that it cannot fix the hard drive and cannot continue with installation. (The repair tools won't fix the hard drive even in single user mode.) \nWhat is confusing me is that the backup of the superblock remains valid, and upon writing the backup over the corrupted current superblock the drive appears on the boot options screen again. And I can boot into Yosemite with none of my apps/data are affected. \nThat said, if I run the installer again it munges the current superblock and leaves the backup still valid. So I can repair the drive again and boot normally. (And continue this process ad-nauseam) \nA: Why doesn't disk utility check for the fact that the current and backup superblocks are different. And attempts to test with the backup if it can't otherwise repair the drive. (Even in single user mode)\nB: Why does the OSX installer consistently  corrupt only the superblock, leaving nothing in the rest of the drive broken. I have done this, including re-downloading the installer, five times at this point.

If this error persists after updating the drivers, you will most likely need to upgrade your graphics card.\n\n\nA: VirtualBox Guest Additions for Windows 8 or later no longer add the necessary registry entries to enable OpenGL support.\nBased on comments in No OpenGL Support for Windows 8 and related links I was able to craft the following Registry file to add the missing OpenGL keys...\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\0000]\n\"OpenGLDriverName\"=\"VBoxOGL.dll\"\n\"OpenGLDriverNameWow\"=\"VBoxOGL-x86.dll\"\n\"OpenGLFlags\"=dword:00000001\n\"OpenGLFlagsWow\"=dword:00000001\n\"OpenGLVersion\"=dword:00000001\n\"OpenGLVersionWow\"=dword:00000001\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\OpenGLDrivers\\MSOGL]\n\"DriverVersion\"=dword:00000001\n\"Flags\"=dword:00000001\n\"Version\"=dword:00000001\n\"DLL\"=\"VBoxOGL.dll\"\n\nDue to hardware detection that happens at various points there is proper order of doing this as well:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable 3D acceleration on your guest before powering it up to install Windows.\n\n*Install Windows 10.\n\n*Install VirtualBox guest additions and reboot.\n\n*Import the above Registry file and reboot.\n\n\nNote that this is limited OpenGL support - it only enables things up to API Level OpenGL 2.1. Some things work fine, others not so much. e.g.: Blender 2.78 refused to start before this change, citing lack of OpenGL support, but afterwards it starts... and just displays a white window.\nUpdate 2017-03-04:\nBlender's all-white window issues were fixed by downloading their software-based OpenGL driver, ftp://ftp.blender.org/sergey/softwaregl/win64/opengl32.dll, and copying it into the folder C:\\Program Files\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\nIt obviously won't be performant like this but at least it's usable... which is important because a lot of Blender add-ons only work on Windows (e.g.: Bos FBX Importer/Exporter only works on win64 systems).\n\nA: You need to install a VNC client so you can connect from any android tablet or phone. Once you do this, you should then install MESS and run the BIOS package installer for PS4. From your android tablet, run the VNC viewer to go into Windows 10 and start ePSXe. From the configuration settings in ePSX, you should be able to select OpenGL as your video drivers. Select any game, and you're all set!\nThe graphics are incredibly smooth on the tablet.

If the person that finds that phone wants to return it, how would they be able to locate me? How to display my contact details and/or a custom message on the lock screen? Are there other ways to tag the phone with your details in case such event takes place?\nAssume the person that finds it knows how to use a smartphone but is not a tech expert.\n\nA: You can add a message to Lost Mode, informing 'honest finders' of how to contact you. See - iCloud: Use Lost Mode\nIt's also possible to add text to your lock screen [We have that on both my & my partner's lock screen images, just in case either of us walks under a bus... which of course would not be a 'lost mode' situation]  \nI've been trying to Google some ideal lock screen info - but they all seem to be based on apps... all you really need is to know the screen size of your current lock screen image, add the text in Photoshop or Gimp etc & set as your new lock screen :/\nThis gives a decent general overview of how to change your lockscreen, but what you really need are the sizes, so you can make one with the '3D' view or just static - this page has a guide to image sizes [ignore that they're trying to sell you an app to do it, any image editor can do this].\nThis is my lock-screen...\n\n", "Q: Able to join captive WiFi network, but not connect to internet I know there are similar questions on the site, but I'm not quite seeing an answer that works for my network.\nI work in a hospital, and we have a guest network that uses a captive portal forcing the user to accept terms before use.  On iOS devices, this network connects without issue.  The Apple Captive Network Assistant (or whatever its equivalent on iOS is called) pops up and shows the portal page.\nUsing my Macbook Air running the latest version of El Capitan, I get very inconsistent results connecting to this network.  I immediately get a connection to the WiFi network, but I do not consistently get the pop-up for the portal to accept terms.  I also cannot force the page, either.  I have tried entering into Safari http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html.  I've tried 1.1.1.1 which is the address that pops up with the captive portal.  None of these work.\nI have also tried to delete my network preference files.  I have tried to manually assign a DNS server 8.8.8.8, etc.\nNone of these things seems to work.  \nSometimes, shutting down and restarting the computer works.  (Software restarts do not typically work).  Or, occasionally letting the computer sit connected for upwards of 30 minutes it will suddenly connect.\nWhy would I be able to connect to the network on iOS and an Amazon FireStick without issue, but not OS X?\n\nA: One more thing that you may try that works fairly consistently for me. Under Network Preferences, change Location to some other, if this is the first time you do this, do \"Edit Locations\" and press the \"+\" sign and add one using any name you like, copy any old settings that may apply. Apply them, and \"Hey, presto!\" you get the log-in screen of your internet service.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Possible to give Airport wifi extender a custom wifi name? I have two recent Airport Extremes and a Netgear router (with wifi turned off).\nI'd like to connect one of the Airports to the Netgear via ethernet, and have that\nAirport provide a wifi network called ALPHA. Then I'd like to use the second\nAirport to extend the ALPHA network such that the extended wifi is named BRAVO.\nI've looked at the Airport Utility and I get the impression that if an existing\nAirport wifi network is extended using a second Airport, the extension wifi will\nhave the same name as the source wifi from the first Airport: that is, ALPHA with no option to use the name BRAVO.\nHowever, I may be wrong. Is there to way to give the second extender the wifi\nname BRAVO?\n\nA: You can change the base station name in AirPort Utility by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open AirPort Utility\n\n*Click on the AirPort of whose name you want to change\n\n*Click Enter Password and enter the password if necessary\n\n*If this isn't necessary, click Edit\n\n*Navigate to the Base Station tab of the menu\n\n*Edit the name, then hit Update\nBut in terms of changing the Wi-Fi name, this is not possible unless you give the AirPort its own network, instead of extending an existing one. It will use the same name as the source network, like you said.\n", "Q: Record iPhone's Screen and the audio with Quicktime? I know that I can record the phone's screen, but I want to record my phone audio too. I prefer for it not to hear the sounds around me (due to my house being loud).\nI tried soundflower and loopback. I might do it wrong. And no, its not same as Screen recording, its Movie recording. I'm doing Walkthrough for the game which has voice characters.\niPhone 5C\nMac 10.11.4\n\nA: You don't need any third-party service; This feature is built right into QuickTime. So just connect your iPhone to your Mac, open QuickTime, click on File > New Movie Recording (CommandOptionN), and it will show your iPhone screen. But in order to record it's audio too, click the little downward arrow next to the record button, and under \"Microphone\" choose \"(your name)'s iPhone\" (by the way if it doesn't show you your iPhone's screen make sure to select your iPhone under \"Camera\" too, though it should be selected by default). Then just hit record and it should do the trick.\n", "Q: I was sharing an iCloud account, would he know about my photos? So I was sharing an  iCloud's account with person I know and lately I took some photos which I later regretted taking.   So I deleted them immediately from my iPhone and I deactivated my iCloud photo library, my photostream and my iCloud photo sharing. Then, I logged out and made my own new account.\nI am worried that this person has access to my photos even though I deleted them, because I know it's possible to  recover deleted photos from iCloud.\nIt is possible for him to recover the photos? Should I be worried? \n\nA: If you deleted the photos, then went into the Recently Deleted folder and permanently deleted them from your iPhone, followed by disabling iCloud Photo Library as you stated, then you should be fine.\n", "Q: How does the DHCP server choose the address range for each client? I've set up El Capitan Server to host DHCP for my network. I've got two DHCP address ranges.\nThe server admin interface doesn't suggest anything about how these ranges are used, and neither does the documentation. When a client connects, from which range does the server take the IP? Do clients get IPs from random ranges, or is there some priority?\nThis is my config:\n\n\nA: The answer to the question you posted:\n\nWhen a client connects, from which range does the server take the IP?\n  Do clients get IPs from random ranges, or is there some priority?\n\nExcluding any existing leases that the client may re-request or any statically assigned addresses, your DHCP server will exhaust all 189 addresses in the first pool before it goes into the second pool.\nWhat you need to do to make this work is have:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X DHCP server listening on 2 separate network adapters (you can use one physical one and use VLANs).  You will need to configure the DHCP listener on one of the interfaces to respond to the 192.168.1.0/24 network and the other interface to respond to the 10.0.1.0/24 network\n\n*You need to separate the networks; either use a switch with VLAN capabilities or get two separate switches.\n\n*You will need either two separate routers or one router with at least 4 user configurable interfaces to route traffic to their respective modems.\n\n\nAlso, I definitely suggest a primer on DHCP (Microsoft has a good one called How DHCP Technology Works) and another on VLANs\n", "Q: How to permamently change terminal font size via commandline/terminal?

I tried to unplug and plug the cable over and over again, but nothing happened.\n\n*the camera isn't working at all. All I see is a black screen.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fix any of these issues?\n\nA: You most likely caused damage to your MacBook Pro's screen, video cable, and or keyboard cable.\nI did a bit of research and found a very similar condition to the picture you provided (see below) it’s called “stage lighting effect”.  This was posted on the iFixit forum.  The resolution to this problem was a warranty replacement.   Being that your MacBook Pro is 6 to 7 years old, this will be an out-of-pocket repair. \n\nYou may be able to repair it by replacing the backlight led, but at this point, it's purely speculative.  My suggestion is to replace the screen rather than risk further damage by attempting to replace the backlight.\n", "Q: How to \"find and replace\" in a PDF on OS X? I need to \"find and replace\" text in a PDF file on OS X Yosemite.\nIt would be better if there was a \"replace all\" feature. How can I do this on OS X?\n\nA: As Tom Gewecke mentioned in a comment, Adobe Acrobat can do this.\nI was also able to do this with PDFpen, as also suggested by Tom Gewecke.\nBoth apps seem great. Since both of them are quite pricey, though, I would also like to share a way to do this with the free and open source software LibreOffice.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the PDF with LibreOffice.\n\n*Click Edit in the panel, then Find & Replace.... Use the feature as desired.\n\n*Click File in the panel, then select Export as PDF.... Save the PDF.\n\n\nI suspect LibreOffice probably decodes and re-encodes the document. But in my case the new document looked precisely identical to the original (except for the edits, of course.)\n\nA: If you are willing to use latex, you could convert your pdf to ps, include it in a new document while using the psfrag package to do the replacement. A quick example would be\n\\psfrag{bla}{blub}\n\nwhich replaces all occurrences of \"bla\" with \"blub\". The conversion to and from ps can be done by pdf2ps or ps2pdf.\n\nA: If the PDF is native and writable, you can open with preview,copy and paste all the contents into Word, then use the \"find and replace all\" feature in Word;\nIf the PDF is scanned, image-based, you can use online OCR tools, they can help to convert scanned PDFs into editable formats, such as Word, or others, then you will be able to find and replace texts in PDF.\n\nA: Usually, you can actually get away with just replacing the string in the file contents. Make a copy of the PDF, open it in a pure text editor (textmate, atom, vim etc.) and search&replace. \n", "Q: Are updates available for Maps on the iPhone 6s plus Maps for my area has not been updated and is missing some major highway additions.  I'm currently using Google as a substitute but its not as integrated into iOS.\n\nA: Apple does do updates but they're primarily server-side, so you might not notice the updates each time.\nThe best way to send Apple feedback about incorrect Maps data is to use Report a Problem under the ⓘ button.  There you can indicate what error the map has and send it to Apple.  Unfortunately, Apple has not published or otherwise indicated a timeframe as to when they will push-out corrections.\n", "Q: Read .pages files in Windows I used a Mac from about 2008 to 2012. I uploaded .pages files on to Dropbox and have since lost access to this Mac, but I have access to the Dropbox where the files are. I am currently using Windows 10 and would like to read these on my Windows machine.\nHowever, all the fixes I've looked up seem to rely on viewing some kind of Preview.pdf by converting the .pages to a .zip. My machine actually auto downloads these .pages files off dropbox as a .zip automatically, however in the QuickLook folder there's only a thumbnail.jpg. No preview. Aside from that there's some kind of index.xml.gz and Pkginfo. Is there any way to be able to read this old file?\n\nA: Well, it's not exactly a solution, more of a workaround, but Google Docs now read .pages files and will in many instances be able to show the contents. It depends on what version and how complex the .pages documents are.\nThe current version of Pages will be able to open Pages '09 files if you have a Mac owning friend.\nThirdly, if you rename the file extension to zip, and unzip them, you will see a preview of the contents that can be of some use to you.\n", "Q: Extracting photos out of very old iPhoto Library to import directly into Apple Photos on El Capitan I have many many photos on a very old version of iPhoto (pre 9.0) that's proving a pain to upgrade into Apple Photos on El Capitan.\nQuestion is - can I simply copy the \"Originals\" and \"Modified\" folders that are inside the iPhoto Library out into the Pictures directory itself, and then import these into Apple Photos directly?\nEDIT\nAlso - if I do this, will the copy necessarily take up twice the space in my hard disk, or will disk level de-duplication help to reduce the disk used? If it takes up twice the space this may not work as the photos take up more space than I have free at the moment.\n\nA: You can, but you'll lose metadata such as albums and you might end up with duplicated photos if you import both the modified and the original.\nInstead, you can use the iPhoto Library Upgrader to prepare the library for import into Photos directly. This Apple tool takes your pre-'09 library and allows it to be imported into Photos. For more information on how to use the iPhoto Library Upgrader, see Using the iPhoto Library Upgrader tool.\nPre-'09 is v7.x and earlier. v8.x and later can be imported directly with Photos without this tool.\n", "Q: How to update Xcode from 7.2.1 to 7.3.1 using terminal (commandline tools) I just need to know if there's a way to update Xcode from 7.2.1 to 7.3.1 using terminal (command line interface)?\nThe reason is I updated the Xcode via Mac App Store and once it was installed, the Xcode is still showing the version as Xcode 7.2.1.\nI've been searching here as well as over Google and I couldn't find any info regarding this.\n\nA: Depending upon the version of macOS/OS X that you have installed as well as your boot volume's storage, you might not see the version of Xcode.app in your /Applications folder update immediately after updating from the App Store app.\nFor a relatively easy way to deal with MAS apps and updates, check out the mas recipe in Homebrew:\nhttps://github.com/mas-cli/mas\n\nA simple command line interface for the Mac App Store.

Try 'sudo' as prefix if you don't have admin privileges.\nbrew update\n\nand for upgrading outdated tools and libraries use below command\nbrew upgrade\n\nThese will update all packages like node, rethinkDB and much more.\nAlso, softwareupdate --install --all this command also work best.\n", "Q: Slow progress of Time machine backup I am backing up my hdd with the Time machine. Even small incremental backups take several hours. For an hour or so I am in the state \"50.3 MB of 496.3MB\", while in Activity Monitor I notice that mds_stores has accumulated already over 116 GB data read, and it increases by about 50 MB/s.   My Hdd is this new pcie-sdd type, so it should be efficient with this sort of backup.\nMoreover in Console it is written that about 2300 files constitute this 0.5 GB of backup. \nI am backing up to external usb Toshiba drive.\nAm I missing something obvious? This is not normal, is it? Can I see which of these 2300 files the Time machine is currently backing up? The \"preparing\" phase was not so long - took about 30 minutes.\n\nA: I was having the same problem pretty regularly. I tried the usual tricks (stop backup, eject, mount, delete .inProgress files, stopping spotlight, changing the throttle priority (sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0). Sometimes, this works. Other times it doesn't and it keeps crawling along at a few MB per hour.\nOne additional trick, that works more frequently, is to force quit the backupd process directly from the Disk tab of Activity Monitor. Then tell it to start backup. This usually works for me. Heads up: this may be a terrible idea in other ways (e.g. maybe it could damage existing backups). In my experience, it hasn't so far.\n\nA: In addition to setting sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0, I've found Sophos can make backups really slow. I expect other virus scanners may have similar issues.\nI found if I turn Sophos off I can make a backup complete in a reasonable time. Unfortunately we are required to use a virus scanner where I work as part of company policy, so I can't turn it off completely or remove it, only suspend it for 4 hours at a time.\n", "Q: Local hostname is already in use on this network?

This might be one of your neighbor. To continue on its correct\nidentification, you will have to use methods which are considered as direct attacks on someone's computer.\nFor example, you might use iStumbler to physically locate it and then have a chance to interview the owner of this new visitor of your network.\n\nA: I had this problem. It turned out that my own computer was logging in twice to the same IP address, one directly via a cord and the other via wifi, which I had forgotten to turn off.\n\nA: You won't easily get hacked. Your router has a firewall which blocks all ports, unless you opened them and routing them to your internal IP address. You also have have to enable these features in your Sharing Preferences to work like File Sharing (port 21 for FTP), Remote Login (port 22 for SSH/SFTP) and a Web Server (port 80/443 for HTTP/HTTPS). These are all unticked by default.\nWhat you can do to secure yourself\n\n\n*\n\n*Untick all the options in Sharing:\n\n\n*Make sure you have a difficult password on all your accounts.\n\n*Enable your Firewall in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall\n\n*Remove any Dynamic DNS services (like DynDNS) from your router (if you don't use it) that links your IP address to an actual address eg. myhouse.homelinux.com that would go to your IP address even if you get 100 new ones every day.\n\n*If you removed the dynamic DNS service, restart your router to obtain a new IP address just to be sure that no one has your new IP.\n\n*Check all the devices on your network, ban any unrecognized device's MAC address. \n\n*Change your router password from admin/admin to something more difficult and your WiFi password.

This is great except all the credentials for iCloud, Adobe, and Microsoft get erased when switching \"host\" computer. The volume on the MBP is encrypted. Is there a way to not lose my credentials when sharing a boot drive like this?\nIt's frustrating to open my MBP up later and have to log into everything again, especially since some apps don't work until validated by iCloud/iTunes.\n\nA: Here's some clarity for anyone looking. The root cause of the sign in when switching the host is that programs often store their license information x'ord (or otherwise encrypted with) a hash of the host hardware. This means that, when the hardware changes, the previously stored configuration is unrecoverable. I've tried spoofing the MAC address, but all programs I test seem to do a deeper hash using the hardware (e.g. system_profiler). I've found a number of workarounds, though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop using apps from the App Store. While the app store uses this hardware hash technique, many indie programs don't. For those, buying directly works (e.g. Moom)\n\n*Where possible store the license information in an un-hashed version. For example, Sublime Text supports this by editing the license file (see https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/st3-license-not-syncing/11738)\n\n*I've found that the iCloud sign in behavior stopped when I created my own keychain (not the default login) and set it as default. Not using an App Store apps, and using this new default keychain, I get no prompts to log into my iCloud account on start up\n\n\nAfter this, some programs that are still offensive are: Office 365, Creative Cloud, and Mathematica. I ended up finally ditching Creative Cloud - I've long switched to other tools, so the one part that I still use (Font syncing), I just downloaded all the fonts locally.\nOverall this is pretty good now. After switching hosts, I get zero dialogs to log in. All my main flows work (Thunderbird, terminal, Sublime). Occasionally I have to log in, but much less of an issue than before.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Software to control the amps output through USB I have a 2014 MBP, and I'm trying to set it so I can charge my phone off the USB. I know it's 3.0 because it is capable of 1000mA in this cropped screenshot of my System Information:\n\nBut it's claiming it's only requested 500mA which I know is BS because my phones says \"Charging Slowly\"\nApple hates Google, idgaf, is there a way I can control the Current Required or Extra Operating Current or something?\nI am not going to buy some obscure specific $30 adapter, that's not the point of this. I am not going to use a USB-Y cable, that's not the point, and I'll lose a perfectly good USB port, leaving me with zero. All I'm looking for is some software to control the output.\n\nA: From Apple Support page on USB devices:\n\nUSB 3 devices can use up to 900mA of power (compared to 500mA used by USB 2 devices). You'll need to use a USB 3 cable to use the 900mA of power available. USB 2 cables don't support 900mA.\n\nYour connector cable and device most likely use USB 2 interface. Not sure what phone you have, but as a side note all Apple devices and cables use USB 2 interface.

It's been like that for hours. I tried downloading the 10.11.5 Combo Update but I was told I needed 10.11.x to install it. So I downloaded the earliest combo update I could find for 10.11.x, which is 10.11.1, and I got the same message, that I need 10.11.x to install. How can I upgrade?\n\nA: You have to go through the App Store to get to 10.11 (technically not true-- you can buy El Capitan on a USB drive, for example). What I mean is you can't just go to apple.com and search for El Capitan and download it. After you have some version of 10.11, you can apply the 10.11.5 Combo Update (although you will not have to since you will get the latest, freshest 10.11.x from the App Store and that's 10.11.5).\nThe 10.11.5 combo update is for taking a 10.11.x system to 10.11.5. It won't work on 10.10.x. So you are doing the right thing going through the App Store, but I think something is clogging up the download-- probably an older software update that didn't complete.\nLook in the Purchases section of your Mac App Store app. You may have an older OS download that is stuck (or paused) too, in addition to the El Capitan. Maybe Mavericks, maybe something else. If you click \"Resume\" on that one I think it will simply disappear and your El Capitan will resume instead.

Recently bought a retina MacBook Pro and of course I was looking forward to enjoying the 10 hours of battery life that was promised.\n2 months into the ownership I started paying more attention to the Energy Saver battery reading and to my shock discovered that the reading was fluctuating constantly.\nNo matter what I did I could not manage to get the 10 hours. For instance at one time it shows 8h 25 min battery power remaining, 30 minutes later it shows 5h 50 min power remaining. So I checked on the web and discovered had to shut down power hungry applications: bluetooth, WiFi, adjust brightness of the screen not to be too bright, I uninstalled Google Chrome and used Safari instead, turned-off keyboard lighting etc. This seemed not to have an effect on what I was experiencing. \nOf course it would have been easier to go to the Genius bar but I first came across this Retina MacBook Pro battery life sucks? Here's how to fix it! web page. \nHowever, before I could implement what is detailed there, I had temporarily had to move from my normal work desk to another room but same network. Then realised…my battery life improved enormously!! Then it hit me that the only difference was that in my normal place I connected to the internet via cable and in the new place was I using WiFi.\nSurely WiFi should consume more battery than cable! Then I realised that in my usual place I used to  connect via cable  but through a Power Line Adapter (PLA). \nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do these power line adapters work?\n\n*Why should they affect battery of my laptop?\n\n*Should I continue using a the power line adapter with the laptop?\n\n\nThere is no information of this from the manufacturer of the power line adapter and have yet to get Apple's opinion on this. \n\nA: How do Powerline Adapters Work?\nPowerline Adapters are, in effect, baluns1 that embed an RF frequency on electrical wire.  What they are doing is taking the unbalanced CAT5 signal (which requires a ground connection) and converting it to a balanced RF modulated signal that is transmitted over the building's copper electrical wiring.  At the other end, it does the opposite to convert it back to CAT5\nWhy should this affect your battery?\nThe powerline adapter doesn't affect your battery per se.  What affects your battery is how much power is required to make your connection and how much traffic you send/receive.  The more power required, the less life on your battery.\nEthernet (CAT5) is designed for \"high speed, long distance, and high reliability (noise immunity).  All of these features generally require trade offs in power consumption.\"2  Additionally, if the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio3) is high, it will increase power and/or lower transmission speeds to accommodate\nWiFi is basically the same but with the benefit that it will adjust its power based on the quality of the signal unlike Ethernet.    Where your signal is excellent, your WiFi adapter will lower its transmission power as extra power would simply be a waste.  Where the signal quality is poor, it will increase the transmission power to ensure connectivity.\nThis is also why your cell phone's battery also doesn't last when the signal is weak.\nConclusion...\nIn your scenario, you may have a WiFi signal that is excellent and for the work that you do, you don't see an impact in terms of speed or reliability going over WiFi.  Your upside is longer battery life.\nHowever, should you have the need for higher speeds (like \"moving\" vast amounts of data), WiFi simply won't keep up with the transmission requirements.  CAT5 will be the advantage here.  Whether it's on a power line adapter or on a switch will not change the power consumption of Ethernet.\n\n1Balun - Balanced/Unbalanced. A device that links together dissimilar wire types and attempts to minimize any negative effects to the signal that would normally result from the dissimilarity.

Since it was fixed by the upgrade, I most probably could have configured my previous version of OSX (10.11.5) to fix it but I don't know how.\n\nA: I also noticed the error log of Lync. I thought disable SIP would help. I tried and the log changed to:\n\nSandbox: Microsoft Lync(608) System Policy: allow(0) file-ioctl /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Resources/HIToolbox.rsrc\nSandbox: Microsoft Lync(608) System Policy: allow(0) file-ioctl /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Resources/English.lproj/Localized.rsrc\nSandbox: Microsoft Lync(608) System Policy: allow(0) file-ioctl /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickTime.framework/Versions/A/Resources/QuickTime.rsrc\nSandbox: Microsoft Lync(608) System Policy: allow(0) file-ioctl /System/Library/Frameworks/QuickTime.framework/Versions/A/Resources/English.lproj/Localized.rsrc\n\nActually, I don't see any different behavior of lync with this change.\nTo disable/enable SIP, see the System Integrity Protection.

My budget is 1200 USD. \nI will be using it for programming mostly. \nI came across 2 laptops:\n13-inch MacBook Pro Item Price:$1,134.00\n  Hardware\n2.5GHz Dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz\n8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM — 2x4GB\n1TB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm\nSuperDrive 8x (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)\n\nAir:\n13-inch MacBook Air Item Price:$1,149.00    \nHardware\n1.6GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz\nIntel HD Graphics 6000\n8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM\n256GB PCIe-based Flash Storage\n\nMacbook Pro seems like it has more processing speed & more storage. However, Air Model has a Flash storage.\nHow much difference does the Flash Storage make? Is it worth sacrificing on clock speed for flash storage?\n\nA: It depends on what kind of programming you're going to do. Especially if you going to test the programs that you're developing.\nAny of these \"is it worth it\" questions are going to be highly subjective.\nI would think that an average programmer would value the SSD more than the extra CPU speed, as compiling/building involves a lot of small files which the SSD will handle faster than the ordinary hard drive. However, a RAM drive would be faster than either disk. So it depends on your setup.\nAlso remember that the MacBook Pro is a 2012 model compared to the 2015 MacBook Air, so you cannot compare the CPU as simply 2.5 Ghz vs. 1.6 Ghz. This could lead you to believe that the MacBook Pro has a CPU that is 56% faster than the MacBook Air - however benchmarks show that the CPU is really only about 4% faster. The GPU is also faster on the Air (Intel HD6000 vs. Intel HD4000).\n", "Q: How to make MBP use USB Ethernet first and when disconnected, use WI-FI? The Wi-Fi where I work is spotty at times and spotty in certain locations (like where my cube is :-(  ).  I won't get into why it's still like this after months of complaining but I want to use the USB Ethernet at my desk since it's more reliable and then fail over to Wi-Fi if I unplug the USB to go to meetings or something.\nI found this link on the apple stackexchange site but it's not doing what I think it should be doing, which is connect in the order specified in System Preferences.  It appears that it's connecting to both and using both sources (Wi-Fi more than USB).\nIn this screenshot, we can see my System Preferences.  USB is first, Wi-Fi is second. \n\nIn this screenshot, we can see via iStat Menus that both interfaces are receiving traffic, although, most traffic has been going thru Wi-Fi even though I've been plugged into USB for about the past 45 min to 1 hr.  Hopefully there's a way to connect strictly via USB when I'm at my desk and Wi-Fi when I move around.\n\n\nA: The problem is that you are on two different subnets with two different gateways.\n\n\nWhat's happening is that you have an established connection with some endpoint going to a particular IP address.  Your internal network firewalls switches and routers all have this state mapped.  \nWhen you go from WiFi to your desktop USB connection, your Macbook wants to keep it's active connections, well, active.  So, it will continue to download over the connection with the active state.\nAs far as OS X and your applications know, you are on two totally different networks.  While the USB may take priority (for new connections), it can't override other connections with active states.\nThe easiest way to resolve this is to simply turn off WiFi when you get to your desk then turn it on when you leave.\n", "Q: Jailbreak an iPad 1 on a PowerMac G4?

It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading Sorry if my question is easy because I am new to Mac. \nOS X Yosemite on my friend's  Macbook Air was removed.

It may have been corrupted or tampered with during downloading.\"\nPlease help what is the problem and how i can solve that.\n\nA: Your installation file for Yosemite has had its digital certificate expire. Which means after a certain date it will no longer work. To work around this issue you open the Date & Time preferences pane, uncheck the box for \"Set date & time automatically\" & set the date back to just after the time Yosemite was initially released (October 16, 2014) then run the installer. \n\nA: \"Sorry if this question is easy\"  that one really cracked me up \nYou don't need to be sorry, any question is welcome :)\nWell, it's actually a tricky one, since (sadly) that's a really unspecific error. It can be caused by many things. Though I guess it's not a filesystem error, since the installer booted up fine. So that's one reason out.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first thing you should check (and add to your question please) is: Where did you get the installation file (ISO/DMG) from? Is it an official distribution from the App Store, or did it come from a third-party source (a pirating website maybe?). The reason that's important is that ol' uncle Apple are extremely annoying with their security. And I mean, extremely. No access to system files on iOS type of extremely. Now that's (as always :P) a problem here, since if the installation didn't come from a first-party source (aka the App Store), then it might not be properly codesigned (I explained a bit about codesigning below). So please edit your question so it specifies the source if the installation so I can help you further.\n\n*Another reason for your problem might just be that the installation is, as specified, corrupted. What does that mean? Well, a lot of times when burning files to a disk (e.g. burning an ISO to a USB drive), there might be a tiny error (maybe even a single corrupted byte) that will just ruin the structure of the whole file. Annoying, isn't it? This can be caused by many reasons. Maybe your file is bad, maybe your disk is bad, maybe your disk maker is bad (in which case I really suggest you try a personal favorite of mine called Rufus, which is also completely free, though sadly it's only available for Windows, so try to get your hands on one for a few minutes), and maybe it just happened randomly (yep, that happens. Bummer.). Go through option one, then if you have a legit, official copy of the installer, check your disk, then just try to burn the installer again. If it still doesn't work, switch to a different disk maker application.\n\nCodesigning\nSo codesigning (code-signing) is pretty much a standard when it comes to Apple systems (macOS/OS X, iOS, etc.). It's something that is really awesome but also really annoying at the same time. From Wikipedia:\n\nCode signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authenticity and integrity.\n\nSo, as I said, it's a pretty neat idea. It's basically a little encrypted string embedded in the software code, that approves that this is the official code, from the official developer, and that it should run just like it's supposed (assuming you meet the system requirements). You can think of it just like a signature: When you see the author's signature on a document, you can be sure that it's his, and that it's original and official. And just like a signature, it's unique and hard to fake. But the problem is that it causes a lot of trouble when a developer doesn't properly sign his code. For example, I tried to use GDB (the GNU Debugger) the other day, and it didn't work due to inappropriate codesigning. Even though, for the most part, it's up to the developer to be responsible for properly signing his code, it's still pretty important to understand what it is, at least in a general, basic level.\n\nA: This happened to me too, and I simply re-downloaded the Yosemite installer using the App Store.\n", "Q: What's the point of using FileVault if OSX automatically decrypts the disk? I have an external HD I use for extra storage and it's encrypted, every time I plug it in OSX asks me for the password to be able to read and mount it. In my mind, this makes sense, the disk is worthless without the password if anybody gets their hands on it.\nMy MacBook disk however never asks me for the password, yet it's also encrypted with FileVault. When I reboot or log off/in, it just loads. I'm probably wrong so correct me on this, but it seems that I'm gaining no extra protection beyond my user password. \nIf someone steals my computer, if they have my account password they have access to the disk whether or not I've encrypted it. So what's the advantage of using FileVault in this case ?\nDupe vote update: The linked question explains how it loads without asking for the password, but doesn't answer the question as to what's the advantage of using FileVault if all I need is my user password to access the disk ?\n\nA: The following is my experience from using FileVault 2 in Yosemite.\nAfter enabling FileVault 2, you will need to login as a user who is authorized to decrypt the disk, every time you boot up your Mac. If you attempt to login as a user who isn’t authorized to decrypt the disk, you will be prompted to provide the FileVault password, or to login as an authorized user first.\nOnce a Mac has been unlocked, any user account can login normally (until the next restart).\nAuthorization is granted on an account-by-account basis. The account that setup FileVault in the first place is implicitly authorized.\nLogging in doesn't mean decrypting the entire disk at once. Files are decrypted on-the-fly, as they are accessed, and file system permissions still apply. So users are unable to access other users’ files unless those files have been shared. Otherwise, since they cannot be accessed, they cannot be decrypted either.\nIf a thief extracts your hard drive, they won't be able to steal your data without providing either an authorized account password or the FileVault password. Until then, that data is encrypted.\nYes, if a thief steals your computer and has your account password, then they get access to your data. But the purpose of FileVault isn’t to protect you from yourself (which, in essence, it would be doing by requiring you to enter both your account and FileVault passwords every time you logged in). Without FileVault, a thief wouldn’t even need your account password to steal your data.\n\nA: Without FV, a password offers limited protection, because OS X provides means to reset an unknown password (e.g. in single user mode). \nFileVault prevents all access to the disk unless a password is provided. \n", "Q: How to make battery indicator show battery status instead of UPS battery on MacBook Air I have a UPS system setup connected to my MacBook Air's dock at home. Whenever I look to check for the percentage of battery remaining on my MacBook Air (when not plugged in), it shows the percentage remaining on my UPS instead of my MacBook Air. Is there a way to change this to show my MacBook Air's battery instead?\n\nA: You can disable the UPS status by turning it off in the System Preferences > Energy Saver > UPS settings:\n\nJust uncheck \"Show UPS status in the menu bar\" and you should have only your internal battery being displayed.\nUpdate:  That check box shows in either the \"Power\" or \"UPS\" tab; not just the UPS Tab as described above.

Lastly, the\n  edited casper should be placed in a directory that is on your PATH.\n\n\nA: First of all the casper-2.1-release.tar.gz file would not extract successfully for me using the normal default OS X way and I tried three other and different methods. I was able to extract the contents however I had to set the casper file to executable after the extraction with the one method that successfully extracted all files. The other normal and default OS X method failed to extract beyond the casper-2.1-release.tar tar-ball.

I used the \"rolling eyes\" emoji available in my iOS keyboard in a social media post, but was dismayed to find that it isn't available on my Chrome on windows 7 computer. While I could install fonts/extensions/etc to \"fix\" the problem on my computer's end, I actually want all my social media audience (such as it is) to enjoy all of my posts.\nIs there a list or resource that shows which iOS emoji's are available broadly on windows 7+ and osx with IE, Chrome, and Firefox, and on iOS 5+ and Android 4+?\nIf not, can we make one here in a single wiki style answer?\n\nA: You can see a full comparison of most current platforms at https://emojipedia.org\nbut only as far back as Windows 8.0\nFor Windows 7: http://classic.getemoji.com\n\nA: I'd be surprised to find anyone compiling such info for the nearly 2000 emoji for old os's.

So I got this strange thing here: http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK122LL/A/power-adapter-extension-cable\nIt says that\n\nThe Power Adapter Extension Cable is an AC extension cord that provides extra length for your Apple power adapter. Use it with MagSafe and MagSafe 2 power adapters and 10W, 12W, and 29W USB power adapters.\n\nSo I guess I can use it to extend the length of the MagSafe power cable? But how? I see no holes that fit it!\nAlso, I got this:\n\nWhich looks like the extension but without the cable part. Is this related?\n\nA: The picture in your question is referred to as an AC wall adapter, or \"duckhead\" (US) and slides out of the AC power adapter so you can then slide in the AC power cable (US), pictured in the link in your question.\nThe picture below shows the \"duck head\" being slid out of the AC power adapter and once removed the AC power cable gets slid in its place, thus providing an extension cord to the AC power adapter.\n\n", "Q: Where does App Store download files to? I just re-downloaded El Capitán off of the App Store for the purposes of transferring it to another machine via USB.  When it was done downloading, it automatically launched the installer asking me to click on continue to start installing El Capitán.  I do not wish to reinstall, so I quit the installer, but now I cannot find it.  Where would the App Store have downloaded it to?\n\nA: Since the location is generated in a different spot, you have to crawl the filesystem to locate the folder(s) that contain these files. \ncd /private/var/folders\nsudo find . -name \"com.apple.appstore\"\n\n# This will throw some errors due to inaccessible directories, so it may be\n# better to use\nsudo find /private/var/folders -name \"com.apple.appstore\" 2>/dev/null\n\n# or, making use of the fact that the result will be within TMPDIR\nls -d $TMPDIR../C/com.apple.appstore \n\nIf you copy the location and type “open “ with a space and paste the copied location, you should see that folder in finder. \n\nA: When finished, it puts them in the Applications folder.\nOS installers are all called \"Install OS X [OS Name]\" which might not be what you expected, if you're looking alphabetically for instance for El Capitan.\nPrior to completion they are squirrelled away deep inside /private/var/folders & not easy at all to find.\n\nA: I did steps mentioned by hphinc from here\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4234582\n\n*\n\n*Start the download\n\n*From terminal, execute the following command: lsof | grep -i pkg\n\n*This will give you a result like: /private/var/folders/lt/05z7qkqs0r33x7t3khp2bxm00000gp/C/com.apple.appstore/497 799835/dge2261667518591136895.pkg\n\n*The last column is the full path to the package it is currently downloading. In this case, it's: /private/var/folders/lt/05z7qkqs0r33x7t3khp2bxm00000gp/C/com.apple.appstore/4977 99835/\n\nA: Ever since macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple implemented a separate appstored (daemon) and appstoreagent processes, which are I believe responsible for handling files and downloading in the background.\nIn contrast to Mojave and earlier, you will now see an additional folder while downloading files from the App Store. Once you click GET or UPDATE and run the following command, you can confirm having two instead of one App Store related folder:\nls -d $TMPDIR../C/com.apple.appstore*\n\n/var/folders/x3/h4gbhgx52mx_wv30p8m0z9vh0000gn/T/../C/com.apple.appstore\n/var/folders/x3/h4gbhgx52mx_wv30p8m0z9vh0000gn/T/../C/com.apple.appstoreagent\n\nThis agent folder is the newer location where the temporary subfolder resides for preflight and downloading the actual package ; until installed.\n\nA: For me it was: /private/var/folders/yy/v7l5q9l962j23_n6ttp9cxw00000gn/C/com.apple.appstore/1127487414/iyu1194865269351609080.pkg\nTo find it out for yourself, open \"Activity Monitor\" -> Select the process \"storedownloadd\" -> Open files and Ports -> then you should see the path.\n\n\nA: On Catalina try finding the files in /Library/Updates/\nYou can use this Terminal.app command\nsoftwareupdate -d --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 10.15.7\nthe -d will download only\nI suggest reading the man page\nman softwareudpate\nBe aware that these are not \"Clickable\" installers. You will have to use Terminal and the software update -install command\n\nUpdates downloaded with --download can be subsequently installed with\n--install, or through the App Store (as long as they remain applicable to your system). Updates are downloaded to /Library/Updates, but are\nnot designed to be installed by double-clicking the packages in that\ndirectory: always use --install or the App Store to actually perform\nthe install.\n\n", "Q: iOS 9.3 offline dictation not working I have an iPad Pro 12.9 and an iPhone 6s, both have \"hey siri\" enabled, along with dictation. However I can't get the offline dictation to show up. I initially thought it was because I live in Italy (but I have everything set to US English), so I tried wiping the iPad and just setting up everything without logging in to any Apple account. I set the location to USA and the language to US English, but I still can't get offline dictation. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I think I solved this!!!!\nI have an iPhone 6s+ and iPad Pro, neither of which allowed offline dictation.\nFor some reason, the language package which allows your iPhone 6s(+) or iPad Pro to do offline dictation appears to be downloaded alongside of any of Siri's English dialects.\nDiscovered this semi-accidentally. I had a weird-and-shouldn't-work epiphany this morning. I had an American English keyboard but prefer Siri's British voice. I wondered if it would only download if the keyboard preference and Siri dialect were the same. Changed the dialect to American English (which I had to download), restarted the phone, and viola, offline dictation was enabled.\nTried the same on my iPad, but it didn't work. \nBut then I realized that Siri's American English was already loaded on my iPad, so I tried downloading the Australian dialect, and voila!, offline dictation was now enabled.\nIt appears that downloading any English dialect for Siri will also download the offline dictation package.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Siri is different from dictation.\n Siri is for asking questions and commands. \n Of course you can ask Siri to spell something.\n On your keyboard between emoji key and the Space bar is the microphone listen key. Press & speek.  Job done I hope. I am not speaking from experience  because my iPad Air is not capable of doing this. Hope to buy a new iPad next week on the strength of it being capable of off-line dictation.\n I rely on online dictation at the moment but I would like to do it off-line as I am extremely dyslexic. \n", "Q: My number is associated with iMessage on other phone, how to remove it?

If I add him on my account as a team member, will he be able to see the source code?\nThank you for your help.\n\nA: To work together on any development project, you preferably need a version control system like GIT or SVN. Apple supports this with Xcode Server. If you're not working on the app at the same time, I imagine that DropBox or any other file sharing system would work as well.\nBeing on the same Apple Developer team would hardly mean anything in this matter at all. Note that you need to apply as a company to the Apple Developer Program in order to have more team members. The only direct benefit during development is that you can use the same certificates for distributing your app. The package you upload to iTunes Connect for distribution via the App Store is a binary, a compiled version of the app from which it is not possible to extract the source code.\n", "Q: How to simulate location in Safari for macOS? I am developer and I'm trying to simulate a different location other than my own on Safari on OS X / macOS.

I am not trying to (and actually don't want to) spoof my location system-wide, I just want to change it for Safari only.\n\nA: In Safari it seems that this still NOT POSSIBLE.\nFor Firefox, there are several browser extensions, e.g. Location Guard which does exactly what you want. Or you can change it via the configuration, as described in this Security Stack Exchange answer.\nChrome has this functionality built-in in the Developer Console.

My main machine is Windows, so ideally I just want to press the power button to toggle the Mac between sleeping and awake.\nIs this possible? From what I've read, it seems like this used to be possible but now it isn't? Are there any workarounds that would enable this?\n\nA: You can no longer just tap the Power Button on a Mac to put it to Sleep. On any Mac running Mavericks or newer the Power Button should function as follows:\nPower Button:\n1~2 second hold = Sleep\n3~5 second hold = Options Dialog\n8~12 second hold = Force Shut Down\n\nAlternatively, if you have a keyboard hooked into the Mac you should be able to hit: Control+Shift+(Power Button on the Mac or Media Eject on Mac keyboard) to put your Mac to sleep.\nTo wake it up just hit the Power Button, or enable Wake On Network if you want to remotely wake the system.\nEDIT:\nIf you need to sleep your system across the network (with no physical access), and have access to the command line you can do one of the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using AppleScript from the command line.osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to sleep'\n\n*From any command line connection you can also try.pmset sleep now\nADDITION:\nNetwork traffic (active network connection allowing file sharing for example) can stop the standard Sleep action on a Mac when hitting the power button. You need to make sure that there are no active network connections, especially if you have \"Wake on Network\" enabled.\nOn some system you will need to make sure that the System Preferences... -> Energy Saver settings are set properly to allow the power button to sleep the system.

Supposedly IOS will attempt to clear some space to download the movie and you should be left with some free space.\nThe procedure I have done to remedy this issue is simple. Backup your phone to your computer, download all the Apps too. Good idea to give the backup a password. Doing so allows iTunes to keep the passwords saved on the phone.\nOnce that is done go into Settings -> general -> reset -> erase all content and settings. And let the iPhone completely erase itself..\nOnce the reset is complete plug it back into your computer and in iTunes restore the phone from your backup (remembering to select the most recent backup).\nThis might take you an hour or so but when the procedure is done you should have regained your missing space. How much space will depend on what all you have on your phone.

You can leave HISTFILESIZE unset. This will configure both the in-memory history and the file-based history.\n# Saves 10 million lines in memory and in the bash history file.\nHISTSIZE=10000000\n\nExplanation, additional information.\nThe problem is HISTFILESIZE only sets the maximum history stored to file when you startup a session. HISTSIZE is what determines how many lines get saved at the end of a session. If HISTFILESIZE is larger than your HISTSIZE, you'll never see more than your HISTSIZE because the file is getting overwritten with HISTSIZE commands (unless you set history to append, but that is a separate topic: look up histappend in shell builtin commands for that).\nThis is the reason you're seeing no effect. With HISTSIZE at default (probably 500) your history file is always getting overwritten by the most recent $HISTSIZE commands. Anything older (which could potentially grow the list past $HISTSIZE) is wiped away.\nFor most cases there's no need to set HISTFILESIZE independently of HISTSIZE.\nHISTSIZE determines how many lines will get written to the history file. The command list is truncated upon exit, before writing to the history file, keeping N most recent lines. By default, this list overwrites the history file.\nHISTFILESIZE determines how large the history file (in lines) can be. The file gets truncated upon startup, keeping N most recent lines. In addition, the history file is potentially truncated whenever HISTFILESIZE is set.\nFinally, although it appears to be undocumented, BASH sets HISTFILESIZE based on HISTSIZE if HISTSIZE is set during startup. I've tried this out on macOS, and a few varieties of Ubuntu, and the behavior is consistent. If you set HISTSIZE in a launch file (not via the command line by any means), HISTFILESIZE will be set to match. (Try it yourself: set HISTSIZE to some arbitarily large value in .bash_profile, exit and start a new terminal, then echo $HISTSIZE $HISTFILESIZE and you'll find them matching.)\nAs a result, there's no reason to touch HISTFILESIZE unless you want different values, and the uses cases to have different values are rare (and typically involve  more history customization settings to get something useful).\n", "Q: Is Trash a safe storage for files?

I then double press the home button, and swipe up on Safari to close it. But next time I open Safari, it starts loading my tabs from when I closed it. How can I stop this? I just want it to open the new tab page and that's it.\nI've tried installing Chrome & FireFox and they both do the same thing as Safari.\nAlternatively, is there another browser that will do this?\n\nA: You misunderstand what swiping up on an app does. Swiping up on an app from the app switcher causes its temporary data to be unloaded from your device's RAM (RAM, short for random-access memory, is your device's short-term memory). However, data from tabs in any browser is stored as permanent data (just like game data and text messages are permanently stored, tabs are too), and this permanent data is unaffected by a RAM unload. Unloading an app from the RAM (swiping up on it) is designed to fix issues caused by app data in the device's short-term memory, not to unload data from an app's place in your device's long-term memory, which is where browser data is stored. \nUnlike the common myth goes, apps like Facebook and Google Maps can still run in the background even after being closed (swiped-up upon); it is up to them to stop using background data. Force-closing an app by swiping up on it unloads short-term data (like how UI elements moved or changed after app-launch) but does not affect any stored data or background app usage. Swiping up doesn't shut an app down.\nIn iOS 10, Apple's upcoming version of iOS set to be released in the fall, there will be a button accessed by long-pressing on the tab-button to close all tabs. Why this doesn't exist in iOS 7-9 is a mystery.\nSo for now, you'll just have to close your tabs one-by-one or just leave them all open*.\n*or switch to Android, where the default browser (Chrome) lets you close all tabs at once. And sadly, Chrome for iPad does not have this feature.\nEdit: My advice is to try other iPad browsers (I personally like Brave Browser and Dolphin Browser) and check if they have a similar option to close all tabs at once; try long-pressing on the X of one tab, or going into the tab switcher.\n", "Q: What format does Xcode use to display 'data' types in plist files?

As I don't know much about video card specs: what do I need to look out for when searching for a replacement?\n\nA: The Mac Pro 3,1 is an aging computer and your video card choices are limited. Using Photoshop on it doesn't effect that use much. Of greater concern would be a good monitor with accurate color reproduction.\nThat said if you start looking for PCI Express x16 video cards that is a good start. You will, however, need to verify with the manufacturer if it is compatible with your O/S and system.\nUnless you were getting unacceptable performance out of the old one, I would just buy a direct replacement, same for same.\n\nA: Small note: the PowerMac G5 3,1 doesn't exist, and was probably confused with the Mac Pro 3,1 by the author. This is further supported by the graphics card, which wouldn't have worked with a PowerMac G5 but came stock with the Mac Pro 3,1. I submitted an edit request, but if it still says PowerMac G5, I'm not confused, just in a rush.\nMac Compatibility\nGraphics cards + Mac Pro = fun.\nThere are two kinds of graphics cards we'll be looking at here: flashed and unflashed cards.\nFlashing is the process of putting a different piece of firmware on a graphics card. Why would you need to do that? Well, if you've ever looked at a Mac graphics card, they're very expensive compared to their PC counterparts. Generally, the only difference is what firmware is on there. Most PC cards can be reflashed with the Mac firmware. I'll drop this here as further reading that does a much better job explaining what I'm trying to get at.\nSound too complicated? Don't worry, you probably don't need to flash your card at all. Most modern cards (usually AMD Tahiti and newer, Nvidia is a bit weird) will work without being flashed once you get to the OS X desktop. This does mean though that certain things won't work (your screen will be black until you finish booting for example.)\nIf you want a Mac card that's flashed without the hassle, you can pay MacVidCards to do it for you. They charge a decent amount, but they have solid firmwares that work.\nWhile some very power hungry cards may run into power draw issues, the Mac Pro 3,1 sports two unused mini 6-pin power ports on the motherboard for up to 150W (in addition to any supplied by the slot), which can power a card with an 8-pin connector. You will need to use converters such as these however, though they're very common and quite cheap.\nYour use case\nGiven that you were previously using a consumer level graphics card and your monitor probably doesn't support 10 bit color, any graphics card should be fine: anything from about R7 370/GTX 760 upwards should be powerful enough, and most things slower should be fine anyways. If, however, you do want support for 10-bit color instead of 8-bit color, you'll want to look at the FirePro/Quadro series (as far as I know most consumer graphics cards don't support 10-bit color for Photoshop specifically out of the box.) These cards are significantly more pricey than their consumer counterparts, as they're marketed towards the professional market. Look for similar performance, but don't expect the same price. I'd also recommend checking out photo.stackexchange.com: they're significantly more knowledgeable than I am about the topic.\n\nA: I think JMY 1000 had a good answer, but I want to add some information about power connectors.\nIn general, you can get away with most AMD Radeon cards (see compatibility chart here) as many of them will work out of the box as unflashed PC cards. The one thing that you lose is the boot screen (i.e. the apple logo, verbose startup text and drive selection if you're using Boot Camp). However, most of them will kick in at the login screen. On the linked chart, look for the 'OoB' column for which ones are identified by MacOS out of the box. Though they're identified and usable, that does NOT imply that you'll get boot screen, just that OSX's drivers will be able to use the card once bootup is complete.\nBe careful, however, that minor differences in a card name (e.g. R9 270 versus R9 270X) does NOT guarantee that the card will work since it could have a different set of identifying values that OSX will not recognize.\nThe more important thing that I wanted to note was in regards to power consumption. The MacPro3,1 (and I presume 4,1 and 5,1) have two 6-pin power connectors on the motherboard which you can use for video cards that need it. Some cards have 8-pin connectors. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE, so be careful when buying an adapter to convert from 6-pin to 8-pin.\nThe idea is that a single 6-pin connector is spec'd to be good for supplying 75W of power. Since the Mac has two, you can provide 75+75=150W of power to a card. The PCI slot provides something around 20-30W (not entirely sure), so you won't be able to use a card that has a TDP draw of over 150-175W.\nSo what about the 8-pin connector? The 8-pin connector is spec'd for 150W. Some of the higher end cards draw 200W or more and thus you'll find 8-pin connectors on them. Though you can find adapters that convert 6-pin to 8-pin, you are now double exceeding the voltage that a single connector is supposed to supply and you risk all sorts of nasty \"unexpected\" issues that could include blowing out your power supply, motherboard, video card, etc. I will note that if there is an adapter that allows converting 2 6-pins into a single 8-pin, that should theoretically be acceptable, though I've never tried it myself.\nIf you're running a MacPro3,1, a relatively cheap sweet spot is a Radeon HD 6870 since they're recognized out of the box, use 2 6-pin connectors and go for about $60 on eBay as of April 2017. You could delve into the 7850 space and get a minor performance bump for about twice the money. Ultimately, you're going to be limited by the PCIe 2.0 spec of the slots which will limit the very high end cards.\nThe important thing is to get a GPU that is recognized out of the box so you don't have to do nasty hacks to OSX to get it to recognize the card and that secondly you are within power specs of what the Mac Pro can actually handle.\n", "Q: Bash Script that only runs in terminal I created a Bash script that should be able to be ran on any machine.

Any idea how to have it execute in these programs or make it only specific to terminal? \nAlso, I'm having an issue as the script I'm running as its being opened from an \"Unidentified developer\".

Explain to them what you just explained to us. If you can convince them, they will likely get a senior support advisor to handle the issue. Perhaps you can negotiate some sort of verbal password with Apple support such that anyone calling them on your behalf would need to know the verbal password before Apple would make any critical account changes. You also need to be careful that the other person does not convince Apple that they are the real you and you are the imposter.\n• In order to make any account changes via Apple support, the caller needs to know some information about the account other than just the email address. After all, an email address is fairly public information. You need to make sure these pieces of info are not obvious. For example, your birth date would be required, however this is also fairly easy to find info.\nYou therefore need to make sure your security questions are secure, and by that I mean the answers to your security questions are not easily discovered information. Note that the answers to security questions do not need to be accurate. You just need to be able to remember them.\nI also recommend setting up two-factor authentication on your Apple ID, which eliminates security questions with amore secure unique one-time code.\nAll security-related settings may be found at appleid.apple.com.\n", "Q: Can sleep password and screensaver password timeout settings be different? In El Capitan, is there a way to separate the request for password when the computer wakes from sleep from the request for password for stopping the screensaver?\nSee System Preferences --> Security & Privacy --> General tab: checkbox for \"Require password  after sleep or screen saver begins.\"\nI would like to keep the password request after the computer wakes from sleep, but I don't want a password to stop the screensaver.\n\nA: No this isn't possible.\nNonetheless, this would be a great general security improvment for MacOS X.\nFor example since I type it pretty regularly but in a safe context, I would like to have an independant password to unlock my screensaver.\nI suggest you to make your question a good proposal of security improvment\non the Apple feedback web server, section about MacOS X, since they didn't yet put in place a section about security feedback.\n", "Q: How to reset file icons associated with default program on El Capitan I've uninstalled my former default text editor which I used for many different file formats. Unfortunately the associated icons are not removed automatically. As a result, several file types still use the icon of the program, even though it's not on my machine anymore.\nThere a several similar questions around here and this one seemed to be most promising, but it doesn't work on El Capitan (version 10.11.5). Does anyone how I can achieve this on a current version of Mac OS X?\nEDIT: After assigning a new default program (no matter if I do that via RCDefaultApp or Finder), the old icon remains. If, for instance, I choose Atom as the new default editor for XML files, the former editor icon (Emacs) is still there.\n\n\nA: Run this command in Terminal: sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\nAnd G'bye atom icon.\n\nA: Have you tried just setting a new default to one document, Get Info on one example, select a new app from the 'Open With' drop menu then hit the 'Change all' button below [hidden below drop menu in photo]\n\nAlternatively, RCDefaultApp [freeware, old but still works well] can change many aspects of file association.\n", "Q: I want to update an app but it asks for another Apple ID Yes, this is asked a lot, but most people suggest deleting the app and re-installing it with your own Apple ID.

Trying to open it from finder, I get an error message\n\n“‹Name›” can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer\n\n(or the local translation of this). On console I read\nCoreServicesUIAgent[‹pid›]: Error -60005 creating authorization\n\nBut if I run codesign on the code, it seems to check out just fine:\n$ codesign -vv .\n.: valid on disk\n.: satisfies its Designated Requirement\n\nSo it seems the bundle got signed correctly.

That took quite a while to work out, so I hope this Q&A will help others avoid that time.\n", "Q: Can an iMac connected via Ethernet to an AirPort Extreme participate in the Wireless network? I have a home network made up of an AirPort Extreme and an AirPort Express that is set to extend the network.\nCurrently, my iMac is connected wirelessly but I have the option to connect it via Ethernet which I would like to try out.\nMy question is this: a number of features in iOS and OS X take advantage of the local wireless network (e.g., sending green bubble messages from the Mac through the phone, streaming audio through something like Airfoil, printing to a WiFi-aware printer). \nIf I connect my iMac with a wired connection to the AirPort Extreme, will it still be able to participate in the local wireless action? \nIf not, can I connect it through Ethernet for Internet access but leave the WiFi on just for the local stuff?\n\nA: Actually you may have a minor, if understandable, misunderstanding of how a network works.\nIf you plug a Mac (or a PC, or anything else...) into a base station that other computers connect to wirelessly they are all on the same network.\nNeither MacOS nor Windows, Linux or anything else differentiates a wireless network with a wired network coming from the same source.\nTry it out, turn WiFi off on on your Mac and then try those things out, you will find that they still work just fine.\nNote that the \"green bubble messages\" distinguish a text message (or SMS if you prefer) that goes over only your carrier's cellular network from the \"blue bubble messages\" (iMessage) which use your phone's 3G or 4G networking to send data through Apple's messaging servers. This is why your blue bubble messages never get to anyone who don't have an iPhone or a Mac.\n\nA: I have my MacBook Pro connected via Ethernet to a mostly wireless network. Streaming and Continuity features work fine (in fact, streaming is much faster, which is the reason I use this setup).\nThe only feature I have found that doesn't work over wires is AirDrop. I believe this requires peer-to-peer WiFi. It's not a big deal to me.\nI am not aware of a way to turn on WiFi for local features only.\n", "Q: How to rm /Volumes/Free when it is really free?

What should I do to keep my contacts, events, notes, etc. and then restore it on the new iPhone? Should I just backup my phone with iTunes or something else?\n\nA: iCloud is your most hassle-free bet. On your 5s, go to Settings > iCloud. You'll find the following settings.\n• iCloud Drive: Any apps turned on here may store content in iCloud without the use of iCloud Backup. This means when you get your new phone, you can set it up as new and still have access to the same content if you redownload the apps.\n• Photos: This one's a bit trickier. You have switches for both iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Photo Stream. These are two separate things and the only reason to have both on at the same time is if you have devices on both iOS 8 or later and devices prior to iOS 8.\niCloud Photo Stream is available starting with iOS 6 (I believe) and only stores your most recent 1000 photos. It does not keep track of which photos are in what albums, does not keep track of edits, and when you get your new iPhone it will only download the most recent few hundred. iCloud Photo Stream does not take up your allotted iCloud storage space, which is 5GB if you're not paying monthly for more.\nIf you're willing to take up more of your allotted space, assuming you have enough, iCloud Photo Library is a better option available on iOS 8 and later. It has no limit on how many photos it can hold, also stores videos, keeps track of edits and albums, and allows your new phone to get all of the same content with no limits.\n• Mail: Stores emails from any iCloud email accounts. If the accounts are not email, you will likely still be able to get your stuff on the new phone when you sign in again.\n• Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes: Stores the associated app's content without the need for a backup.\n• Safari: Stores bookmarks, reading list, history, iCloud Tabs, etc.\n• News: Stores information on what you've subscribed to and liked/disliked.\n• Wallet: Stores passes, cards, etc.\n• Keychain: Securely stores your saved passwords from websites and apps to the cloud.\n• Backup: Everything above will work seamlessly without needing a backup, and when you get your new phone you can just \"Set Up as New\" and it's all automatic. If there is some stuff you want to keep not covered above though, such as an app not supporting iCloud Drive, you can turn on backup and in Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage > your backup you can choose which apps specifically you want backed up. If that app is already turned on in a step above, it probably doesn't need turned on in Backup.\nIf you use Pages, Numbers, or Keynote make sure Use iCloud is turned on in Settings > Pages, Settings > Numbers, and Settings > Keynote.\nIf you're using Backup, when you get your new phone you'll need to do \"Restore from iCloud Backup\" instead of setting up as new.\n• If you don't have enough iCloud space, you can always experiment with other clouds like Dropbox, but iCloud is the most seamless. There's also iTunes Backup like you mentioned which is easy but not quite as seamless.\n", "Q: iMac causes WiFi interference / outage I have an Apple Airport Extreme WiFi router and three wireless clients (iPhone, MacBook Pro & iMac).\nThe iPhone and a MacBook Pro are connected to the WiFi network and everything works fine. As soon as I join the WiFi with the iMac, all three lose Internet connectivity and the ping times for external sites go to ~100,000ms at which point the network becomes unusable.\nAs soon as I shut the WiFi on the iMac off, the network returns to normal. What's interesting is that my WiFi base station has two SSIDs, one private network one guest network. It doesn't matter which network I join with the iMac, both cause the same problem.\n\nA: I had the same wifi issues with two iMacs, one iPhone, one android... the iMacs were the problem.

My iPhone was stolen, what can I do to protect my data and get the phone back?\n\nA: Sorry to hear that, but if you have your iPhone setup with iCloud then most likely you have Find my iPhone setup and by following these instructions you'll be able to place your phone in Lost Mode and that person won't be able to view any of your content and if you have iOS version 7.0 (which you do, as the iPhone 5s shipped with iOS 7) or later then the phone will have an Activation Lock meaning that this person could never activate this iPhone even if they place the device into DFU mode.\n\nA: Provided you have Find My iPhone enabled, you can go to iCloud.com and lock the device and locate it on a map. If the phone is not on when you find it, it will alert you when it is turned on and located. Once you know where it is, you can get it or have the police get it, depending on the situation.\nBesides that, I'd recommend calling Apple at 1-800-MYAPPLE and seeing if they can help you disassociate it from your Apple account, and you can report it to your cell carrier so the phone will be disabled permanently.\n", "Q: 17\" mid-2009 MBP, 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo: can it take 16GB RAM?

Hot corners would be ideal if that's possible.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: If you set your screen saver to require a password when exiting and then set one of the screen corners to turn the screen saver on, there you go instant turn my screen saver on gesture.\nUnfortunately MacOS does not have a universal keystroke to lock the computer like Windows does.\n\nIf you have Mojave you can, the shortcut is there in the Apple menu:  ⌃ ⌘ Q \n", "Q: iPhone is not backing up to iCloud My iPhone 6S on IOS 9.3.2 has been set in iTunes so that it automatically backs up to iCloud. However it only backs up if I manually choose to do so from the iPhone. \nThe phone is charged at night and has a working WiFi connection, it is running a sleep monitor app.\nWhy is it not backing up and what do I need to do to make it do so?\n\nA: The reason behind is because your device is not locked.\nAs stated in this Apple document that in order to \"Automatically back up with iCloud Backup\" \n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that iCloud Backup is turned on in Settings > iCloud > Backup\n\n*Connect your device to a power source\n\n*Connect your device to a Wi-Fi network\n\n*Make sure that your device's screen is locked\n\n*Check that you have enough available space in iCloud for the backup\n\n", "Q: iMessage Vulnerability With iOS 10 Public Beta 1 According to this CNET article, by sending a certain file in an iMessage an attacker could gain access to stuff like passwords on the victim's iPhone. The good news is that Apple is on top of things and this vulnerability was apparently fixed in iOS 9.3.3, however I (and many others) am running the iOS 10 Public Beta. So where does this leave us? Was this fixed in iOS 10 Public Beta 1, 2, or not at all?\n\nA: I haven't officially verified that the bug is not present in the iOS 10 beta, but iOS 9.3.3 was in developer beta for quite awhile before iOS 10 was even announced, so it wouldn't be reasonable for a newer OS, albeit a beta, to not have this patch as well.\nIf that's not enough, consider that Apple generally does not discuss security vulnerabilities until they are safely patched. CNET only discovered this because Apple posted it in their security report for iOS 9.3.3.

I am using my mechanical keyboard (USB, Cherry blue switches, not that that's important) with OS X. The problem though, is that I get relatively frequent \"bouncing\" or \"chatter\" of the keystrokes. For example, if I type hello something like heello might appear. This is rather annoying, especially when entering passwords.\nUnder Linux I could solve this in software by debouncing, using the xkbsetbouncekeysdelay setting, which adds a minimum number of milliseconds, e.g. 40ms, between key presses. Rather a blunt tool but solves the problem perfectly. However, I haven't been able to find an analogue under OS X.\nDoes anyone have any software based suggestions? Am I overlooking a simple plist setting somewhere?\n\nA: I had actually forgotten about this, but a recent comment prompted me to post the solution I ended up going with.  Since macOS does not provide a debouncing facility, I ended up writing my own [1].  It hooks into keypresses using a CGEventTap, and if the most recent keypress keycode is equal to the current one, with a timestamp more recent than ±30ms, it disregards it as a bounce.\nI apologise for the rough and ready state of the tool, but compile it with the Makefile (you'll need XCode or Developer Tools or whatever they're called these days), and run it using sudo ./debounce (root permissions are necessary because it hooks into all keypresses).  It works and has worked for me for the last year-ish, but use at your own risk, free of charge, free of warranty.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/toothbrush/debounce-mac/\n\nA: Have you tried going to System Preferences->Keyboard and increasing \"Delay Until Repeat\"?\n", "Q: What exactly does this “palm tree” icon under “Recent” in iPhoto (9.6.1) represent? Is there a way to disable it? I’m sorting through photos in iPhoto (version 9.6.1) on my Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) machine and just noticed this odd “palm tree” icon listed under “Recent” and utterly have no idea what it represents or means.\nIn my case it’s showing exactly one—seemingly arbitrary—photo from March 7, 2016 and for the life of me I have utterly no idea why this would be the case; see screenshot below.\nThe “sorting” I am doing encompasses simply renaming photos so they have a human readable name—instead of DSCN_ or IMG_ and such—and nothing else. I’ve rebuilt the iPhoto database by holding down the Command+Option keys a few times, but it doesn’t seem to affect anything.\nDoes anybody know what it means? Is there any simple way to disable it?

I looked at \"erase\", it senses the drive. it's there. i can verify and repair it under erase, but when i try reinstalling a new copy of the OS, no SSD option shows up (where i can install the OS).\nWHAT WORKED FOR ME:\nI found that my problem was that I did not give a name to my SSD when I erased it the first time. i erased the SSD again (when the internet recovery was finished, but THIS TIME, i made sure to write a name for the SSD i was erasing. when i started the reinstall option again after erasing was finished, my SSD showed up as an option.\n\nA: Yes - internet recovery fails to see an internal drive (or external drive), it's almost always time to swap hardware / repair things.\nYou could on some rare instance need one last SMC / NVRAM reset and try again on a different network internet recovery if you think the checksum / validation that the boot image is correct was somehow failing at the same time as the download failed, but this almost always is a hardware service needed situation.\n", "Q: Antivirus in Macbook Do we need to install antivirus in OS X? I'm using macbook Pro 13\" currently. Which antivirus is recommended (and free)? Any other better way to protect information in OS X?\n\nA: I think you mean OS X, not iOS? MacBooks run OS X. iOS is the OS on iPhones, iPads, etc.\nSome good, free antivirus options for OS X are Avast and AVG.\nYou're definitely safer if you use them. There are viruses out there for OS X. That said, it's not as needed as it is on Windows. I personally don't use any antivirus on OS X, because I feel that it slows down the system a little bit. I feel the risk is rather small, so I am willing to take it. \nIt comes down to how careful you want to be. If you don't mind your system slowing down a little bit, and want to minimize the risk of viruses as much as possible, then get antivirus. If you don't want the small slowdown, are wise enough to spot obvious traps like fraudulent websites asking you to install programs, etc, and you feel the risk is small enough, then don't install it.\n", "Q: How do I set an animated desktop background without OnyX? In OnyX, there is a setting in Parameters > General > Animated desktop background: where animated wallpapers can be set. While this doesn't seem to work very seamlessly (moving between spaces displays old wallpaper briefly etc.) and doesn't persist over restarts, I wonder how OnyX does this.\nIs there some hidden setting where one can do this without OnyX?\nNote that my question is not about how to set gifs as wallpapers (although maybe this is what OnyX does?).\nSystem: 10.11.5\n\nA: Yes, this can be done without OnyX.\n\nFirst head to System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver > Screen\n  Saver and select one of the screen savers included in OS X, or a\n  third party screen saver that you’ve previously installed.

After updating to El Capitan I discovered that I was no longer able to type circumflexes. Before I was able to enable the \"International Extended\" keyboard in settings. Now it seems to be replaced with \"ABC Extended\", which does not permit me to type circumflexes in the way that I was used to.

Or the base character then option shift 6.  \n", "Q: Backup iPhone contacts etc to move to new iPhone (no iCloud) I have three iPhones linked to my AppleID. (Don't ask me why, it began when Apple was not providing family access.) I already have iCloud Contacts, Calendars, etc. on my AppleID made from one of my iPhones. \nNow I'm going to replace my another iPhone (which doesn't use iCloud Contacts and Calendars) with new one, and need to backup and move contacts and other stuff. Since I don't want to merge Contacts and Calendars, I can't use iCloud on the iPhone I want to backup. \nIs it possible to change AppleID on the iPhone I want to backup keeping all the stuff untouched to link it to new iCloud account? Or is there another way?\n\nA: Switching Apple IDs\nIf you go to Settings > iCloud and Sign Out, everything should stay safely on your phone with the exception of iCloud Drive documents and photos from your Photo Library. If you were to then sign into a different Apple ID, such as a newly created one, you could turn things like Contacts and Calendars. I say should because if you get any warnings saying something will be deleted, you should take them seriously.\nUnfortunately , this requires taking extra precautions for iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Drive. If you do have things in iCloud Drive or iCloud Photo Library, you can go to www.icloud.com on a computer and perhaps download your documents and photos from there so that they are safe on a computer.\nThe Alternative\nContacts and Calendars are a tricky thing to backup without iCloud as they don't seem to be included in the catch-all iCloud Backup.\nThere may be many alternatives to the above, but the only one I thought of off the top of my head was to check with your carrier about using your SIM card for that purpose.\n\nA: There's a free app available in the App Store called My Contacts Backup which backs up all your contacts (free version is limited to 500 contacts) into a VCF file which you could then use to import in icloud.com by clicking on the Cog Wheel on the bottom left corner in the Contacts section and then clicking on the Import vCard... option from that menu.\nPersonally I've never used the above mentioned app but its App Store reviews seems to be phenomenal.\nAbout switching Apple ID's that might be an option but you'll want to make sure to first setup your primary iCloud account if you'd like to use the rest of the iCloud features like iCloud Drive, Photos, Notes, Mail, Etc. and then add your new account which you'd like to use only for Contacts by adding that account by pressing the Add Account within the Mail settings and on that one select only Contacts (while on your primary you'll leave contacts turned off).\n", "Q: Open Directory network user last logon time I am looking for a bash command to query my LDAPv3 server from the client side in order to find the current user's last logon time. \n\nA: Will this do the job for you?\nldapsearch -LLL -x -h <hostaddr> -Z -D cn=admin,o=local -W  \"(&(objectclass=Person))\" logintime \n\n", "Q: Using email addresses in App Store screenshots An app we're working on has a field to accept email addresses. For a screenshot, we want to show something in the field.\nSome concerns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can we use non-Apple domains? (e.g. outlook.com, gmail.com, yahoo.com) Or will Apple reject them?\n\n*Can we use Apple domains? (e.g. icloud.com)\n\n*Can we use obviously generic e-mail addresses? (e.g. friend@icloud.com, co-worker@gmail.com) Or does that open us up to lawsuits for misuse of personal property?\n\n*Should we just put in an email but blur parts or all of it? For example, leave the @ and .com unblurred?\nWhat have others done? Would be interesting in seeing what has been approved recently.\n\nA: According to the App Store review guidelines, you're responsible for ensuring you own all rights to whatever you put in the description or screenshots.  You can put email addresses in the screenshots but, of course, you need to own those addresses.  You also must be prepared for the onslaught of spam and other email those addresses will receive once the address is displayed to the world.\nCommon sense would tell me that you should blur at least part of any address you display.  You want to show potential customers an accurate representation of what your app can do.  If that involves displaying an email address, I think you're ok and as long as you blur parts of the address I don't believe Apple will reject it.  If the address is something like xxxx@apple.com or xxxx@yahoo.com, then you should expect a rejection, in part because you're implying that Apple uses or endorses your app as well as you're using a registered trademark.  That is in the review guidelines so it's pretty much a guaranteed rejection.\nJust make-up an email address and blur the parts you indicated, you should be ok.\n", "Q: Multiple or duplicate cursors I'm seeing a problem where I have multiple mouse cursors on certain parts of my screen or screen configurations.

I would like to try a disk utility fix. I'm not sure if I need the specific install disk for the precise model, or if a generic Snow Leopard install disk will allow my to try to repair the disk.

If you can get on a copy of OS X El Capitan though, it would be better to have it installed on that Mac via a bootable USB.\n", "Q: How does OS X connect to other computers on the LAN? I am behind a router, with some windows users, and I noticed that their computers show up in my finder, under shared. I never closely examined this feature, but today I decided to connect as my user on the windows computers. What I noticed is a directory labeled Users popped up. Clicking on this, and then my user directory, I see the normal OS X user folder structure, but the files are the ones on the computer.\nThis looks like FTP to me, but the windows computer has no special configuration, so I don't think that that's the case.\nHow does the OS X connect to other computers on the LAN, when they have no special configuration to do so? What service is this?\n\nOS X 10.11 El-Capitan\n\nA: There are several Protocols in a LAN Environment which a Mac can use (AFP, SMB etc.). You can connect to a PC's usually (or a PC Share) via SMB. \nIn order to connect to that PC you have to provide credentials, a Username and a Password. If you have a local Account (ignoring complex Network-, Server- and Domain-Architecture for a moment) on that Computer you can use these Credentials and have access to all Folders for that User-Account, including a 'Documents' and 'Desktop' Folder. So you are not actually seen the Folders from your OS X User-account, but the default Folders from the Microsoft OS which happen to be Named the same ('Desktop' etc.). There are differences, f.e. on OS X you have a 'Library' Folder which you don't have on Windows etc.\nFTP is a completely different Protocol, requiring an FTP Server and Credentials. I doubt that this is the case in your environment, even though you can access it via Finder (on the menu bar, click Go > Connect to Server and enter \"ftp://test.domain\", if \"test.domain\" is the name of the Server).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2009, can't format/fresh install So, i'm in a (bit of) a pinch. \nI was doing a format/fresh install of MacOS on my old 13-inch 2009 MacBook Pro going through OS X Utility and Reinstall OS X.

Being on a Mac, of course we are handicapped on not having mnemonics support to perform the action by the keyboard.  Or are there some shortcuts to do these?\n\nThe point here is that needing to hunt for the menu item with the mouse and then click on the item is way slow compared to keyboarding.\nUpdate: An answer was provided with a link to the shortcuts provided by MS online help. I should have noted that link had already been pored over and does not mention any shortcuts for \"Insert\" items.\n\nA: There are keyboard shortcuts for almost every menu command.  Here's a link for Microsoft's Office for Mac keyboard shortcuts site.  I normally frown on just posting a link but because there's so many shortcuts available it doesn't make sense to copy/paste them all here.\nAlso, if you don't find the shortcut you're looking for, you can always create your own.\n\nA: There appears to be no keyboard shortcut, but you can add the Insert Picture command to the Quick Access Toolbar (via Powerpoint/Preferences/Ribbon & Toolbar).

But when I look in the folder where photos are stored, ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters, I don't see any videos there.  (Under iPhoto, Live Photos were imported as separate video and audio files.)  So where is the video piece stored?\n\nA: On OSX 10.12.4 with Photos version 2.0 (3150.4.120) they appear to be stored in ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/media/master/$NUM/00/jpegvideocomplement_$HEX.mov.  These don't appear to be indexed by Spotlight.\n\nA: I figured it out.  They are stored in ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/resources/modelresources, though not in a folder structure that is easy to find your way around.\nHowever, at least your video files will have the same name as photo files, for example IMG_2727.jpg and IMG_2727.mov.  Once Spotlight has indexed the folder, you should be able to search by filename from the Finder, if you restrict to looking inside the Photos library folder.

I tried the solution in How can I make my Macbook Pro's headphone jack stop \"humming\"? by changing audio MIDI setup and it did not work. So I am wondering whether there is some other ways to solve i\n\nA: I glean from the official specs:\n\nsound pressure level: 125dB\n\nThis can mean just about anything, but if my hunch is right in that what they are trying to say is that their sensitivity is 125dB/mW, then this is indeed a highly sensitive set of IEMs, and I'm in no way surprised that they hiss to some extent when plugged into your MacBook Air.\nWhile the MBA has pretty low noise levels as far as laptops go, it should still be more than high enough for the IE80s to pick up.\nJust to be certain of course: See if the noise changes considerably by plugging and un-plugging the power supply. Also check how much noise you can hear through a more normal set of headphones (iBuds, PortaPros, something like that).\nIf the noise level is objectionably high only through the IE80s, even when running the Mac on battery power, your choices are essentially to either live with it, use other headphones, or buy a usb DAC/amplifier with a sufficiently low noise level. Something like those from Leckerton or JDS Labs, for example.\n\nA: I had this same problem with both headphones and my external speakers (both Bose).  I had more than just buzzing, I had noticeable pops when I just touched my headphone jack or audio cable.  \nAfter struggling with MIDI and sound tweaks forever, what solved my issue permanently was that I got an external (USB) DAC interface.\nMy first device was the Behringer UCA202 Audio Interface which I connected directly to a Bose Wave radio.  \n\nIt had the convenience of providing both a optical and analog out as well as another analog input as well as a headphone monitor port.  One of the features of a product like this is that it shows up as an additional audio device in System Preferences > Sound.  This allows me to pipe music to my Bose while system sounds came out of the system speaker.  \nWhat was even nicer about the product was the price; less than $30 when I bought it.\nI have since upgraded to the Marantz Hi-Res Audio DAC since I got into Hi-Res Audio.  This DAC is obviously overkill if you want to remove hum or the noticeable buzz; it's just absolutely phenomenal in terms of sound quality.\nSince going with an external DAC, I don't think I will ever go back to \"futzing\" around with sound settings trying to perfect it - it's just not worth the time.\n", "Q: How to backup files from black screened iPhone I dropped my iPhone 6 today; even though there is no noticeable harm on the outside, my phone screen is completely broken. Actually, the phone does not even vibrate when I turn it on. The only reason why I know that it turns on (I think), is that my iTunes say \"iTunes could not connect to the iPhone 'my iPhone' ... because the passcode is not entered.\" I have tried holding home + power button for zillion seconds, and it does not do anything for me. I think the display is really gone.\nAlthough it stinks to have my phone broken, I am more concerned about the data I have inside. I have many text messages with my girl-friend and voice memos that I do not want to lose. I have a program that can obtain these data, but because I cannot unlock the phone with my screen completely gone (I think touch is not working either), I do not know what to do.\nCould you please help me?\n\nA: Check any computer you connect the phone to see if it has a backup. Then check in iCloud.com to see your last backup. If you have paired a bluetooth keyboard, use that to unlock the device. Also - the screen could be out but the digitizer might still work. Can you put another iPhone 6 next to yours and go through the motions to enter the PIN by tapping where you know the touch areas are on the screen?\nAt that point, you'll need to make a decision based on cost and time you can be without the phone while it's repaired or the data recovered. \nThe data on the iPhone is almost certainly encrypted so you'll need to pay someone to make a forensic-type repair on the phone to replace the screen without damaging the storage. That costs more than a repair where you don't need to keep the data intact. Also, you can't pair the phone to a new computer without pairing a bluetooth keyboard or repairing the digitizer / screen.\nOnce you have quotes, you can make a decision based on the availability of reliable service where you live. If you took your phone to a skilled technician at the Huaqiangbei electronics market in Shenzhen - you might pay $50 for the repair and have your pick of 100 technicians in a 4 block radius. Other places, you might have to pay $5000 and ship your phone.\nPaying someone to decrypt the contents is probably a factor of 10 more expensive on both the low end and high end unless you could tell them your passcode.\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*spend half an hour assessing the availability of backups (and maybe time to go visit computers you could have synced to)\n\n*make a buy a new phone decision if you are going to shop around or ship your phone for repair to the cheapest shop you trust to make a custom repair. (you can then sell either the repaired phone or the new phone based on whichever recoups your investment in spare hardware to allow a cheaper repair).\n\n", "Q: Wifi drops intermittently on Macbook Air I have read the other articles with a similar issue but they don't have the exact same issue as I do, hence this post.

I downloaded xcode from the Mac App store on my home computer and it installed to around 11 GB on my applications folder. I tried copying the xcode app from the applications folder to my external hard drive where I was stopped mid-way and the error said some items can't be moved to due permission issues (that's not exactly what the error said but something like that). Is there any solution?\n\nA: Have you reviewed the helpful details in this question? \nI have successfully moved Xcode to a different drive (though in my case an internal SSD), but as the answer says a simple move doesn't quite sort everything out, and you need to fix where various Command Line Tools think the install is. The problem with permissions is probably not due to it being an external drive. You need to get enough permissions to move files, which you can do at the command line ('terminal' application). If you don't know how, then look for help on moving and relinking directories in OS X and proceed carefully having practiced on tiny directories first, having taken a backup.\nPS I can't comment on the question, wpbut I think your mean move not copy which makes a big difference.\n\nA: There are a lot of possible solutions, including, making use of symlinks, dual booting two versions of macOS (one on external SSD), and many more.\nBut the best way I found was to create a new macOS user and change its home directory to external SSD (by going to advanced user settings under Users & Groups System Preferences).\nThe exact steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new APFS partition on external SSD with 100GB storage. (say NewVol)\n\n*Create new macOS user and change its home directory to /Volume/NewVol/user\n\n*Logged into the new user with external SSD connected, and installed xcode in ~/Application. (i.e. the local Application folder, not /Application)\nWhy this works best is because you don't need to manually manage symlinks, also symlinks might create problems during builds. All the required files (including builds and temporary files) are stored in user directory, so no space occupied on internal drive. Also, no hassle of installing a complete separate OS, and going through cycles of reboots to switch the OS.\n", "Q: How to get to previous calandar entry's after the date has passed When entering calandar events on my calandar I sometime need to go back and see what date I made a call or went to an event.

If not, what's the equivalent tool to achieve similar results (tracing all page faults with stack traces).\n\nA: No - there is no linux kernel to profile on OS X - so that tool is a fish out of water. OS X probably ships with everything you need though.\nOn macOS / OS X - there is a mach_kernel in use. It's exhaustively documented at: https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html\nAdditionally, you might be fine profiling the BSD based unix layer with the supplied command line tools. It really depends on which operations or aspect of system performance you wish to measure or debug.\nTo the specific topic of page faults, you can get cumulative statistics from top and vm_stat and then dig into specific processes using either dtrace or Instruments - which is a free tool part of Xcode on the app store and has a graphical interface for profiling the system calls per process or as a system.\n", "Q: Folder action with Automator file search Since a couple of years, I used the folder action successfully which is shown in the screenshot:\n\n\n*\n\n*A file is added to \"Downloads\"\n\n*\"Find Finder Items\" with the shown criteria is executed\n\n*If the filename fulfils the criteria, the file is moved to another folder.

Does someone have a better, glob way to it?\n\nA: There is no known method to exclude from Spotlight a file or a folder based on a pattern (ex.: its name).\nHowever it's possible to exclude a folder from Spotlight by adding to it an empty file .metadata_never_index.\nYou can use this method to ignore all node_moduleand bower_modules folders:\nfind /path/to/projects -type d  -path '*node_modules/*' -prune -o -type d -name 'node_modules' -exec touch '{}/.metadata_never_index' \\;\n\n\nEdit:\nIt look like the method .metadata_never_index is ignored by Spotlight since Mojave.\n\nEdit 2:\nAs @JohnLee pointed it out, the extended attribute com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem is not related / doesn't have any impact on Spotlight.\nHowever *.noindex and symlink aren't indexed by mds (the backend of Spotlight). You can use it as band-aid:\n# Rename all node_modules to node_modules.noindex and create a symlink node_modules -> node_modules.noindex\nfind /path/to/projects -type d \\( -path '*node_modules/*' -o -path '*node_module.noindex/*' \\) -prune -o -type d -name 'node_modules' -exec mv '{}' '{}.noindex' \\; -exec ls -s '{}.noindex' '{}' \\;\n\nNote: if you use npm-ci, the node_modules is \"automatically removed before npm ci begins its install\".\n\nA: Apparently adding '.noindex' to a parent folder name will prevent Spotlight from indexing.\nNB: I haven't personally verified.\n\nA: In case anyone missed fsb's comment in the question, as I did. Apple provides a privacy tab in the Spotlight settings.\nGoto \"System Preferences\" > \"Spotlight\" > \"Privacy\" > \"+\" Add folders to the list.\nNote: This may not work immediately, I had to restart Spotlight to see the effects. \n", "Q: How to make automator app use a specific folder as input I have a number of processes that I need a Mac Mini to run with no input.\nOne of these tasks is to take ingested video files, rename them and transfer them to another location. \nThe app I am using to ingest the files is called one way sync and it is capable of running a script upon completion.

However I do not know a way to specify the input for this app as the contents of X folder. \nI need the app to run on the contents of folder X every time. \nCan anybody tell me what i'm missing?\n\nA: Apple's documentation on files is a bit of a laundry list - but read a little so you can decide if you want to use POSIX names or native names. POSIX uses / and native uses : to denote folder breaks. The following two lines are both the Downloads folder for a user with a short name of me:\n\"/Users/me/Downloads\"\n\"Macintosh HD:Users:me:Downloads\"\n\nMac Automation - Files and Folders - Apple Developer\nOn the left sidebar are links to sections dealing with Processing dropped files and folders as well as the concept of watching folders.\nI would try my hand at writing a script that uses the built in watch folders triggers so you don't have to deal with passing file names or starting and stopping the script. If that doesn't work, you could always invest in a tool like Hazel that does what you want as well, but it's good to try and learn automation since it's so powerful long term.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Hardware & Software Issues under warranty I have a MacBook Pro(13-inch Retina display), bought on 27 November 2015, from Bangalore India.\nLast Monday it got some booting problem, and I was not able to go forward from the boot screen, always got stuck up at OS booting view.\nI have given the device to service center, and after one day I got a response from service team saying that device dose not have any hardware issue, it might be a OS issue, so they need to format all data and re install the OS.

You would want to buy insurance or pay for a rental or loaner equipment available to cover the time when a warranty repair is ongoing. Also, your warranty is only for hardware and not software. \nApple used to provide loaner for service (and may still do so) to businesses as part of the Apple Retail joint venture program. \nAlso, there can be a different level of service worldwide when Apple establishes a local retail store presence versus ones where Apple relies on third party authorized agents (like in India presently). If the third party wants to have more parts on stock to speed repairs, then the prices will be higher than a third party that carries no stock and has to order each only when needed from out of the country but can charge less (or profit more) from the costs allowed per repair from Apple for warranty service. \n", "Q: Cannot execute this binary file appreciate any assistance, I'm a Mac Noob\nIm trying to upgrade MySQL in MAMP to 5.6 according to the these instructions\nWhen I try to run the .command script as per #2 I get the following output:\nSandies-MacBook:~ sandie$ /Users/sandie/Downloads/Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command ; exit;\n-bash: /Users/sandie/Downloads/Install_MySQL_5.6.25.command: cannot execute binary file\n\nI have found this post, but I still get the \"Cannot Execute\" error.

After I decreased the OSX partition I tried to log into the bootcamp partition but it didn't show up anymore, even if it appears Ok in finder. Would you please help me to recover it ?\nThanks a lot,\nEmil\n\nA: Usually, in order to enlarge your Windows partition, you have to relocate the entire partition. Or, in other words, there usually is not way using OS X to enlarge the Windows partition after shrinking the OS X partition. You can, for example, remove Windows completely and then reinstall Windows to a larger partition. There are also third party tools, such as Winclone, that can be used to backup a Windows partition, shrink the OS X partition, create a larger empty Windows partition, then restore Windows to this larger partition.\nI am not sure how just shrinking the OS X partition alone would cause Windows not to boot. One idea is that the type of partitioning was changed. In other words, you either had a pure or hybrid GPT partitioned drive and, after shrinking the OS X partition, the partitioning changed from pure to hybrid or hybrid to pure.\nA pure GPT partitioned drive requires Windows to use the EFI to boot, where as a hybrid GPT partitioned drive requires Windows to use the BIOS to boot. So the questions are what is your current partitioning scheme and how does Windows intend to boot?\nThe following Terminal application commands can be use to determine you current partitioning scheme. None these commands will change your computer.\ndiskutil list\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\n\nIf fdisk shows more than one partition, then Windows will assume to use a BIOS boot method, otherwise the EFI method will be used.\nYou can determine if Windows was using a EFI boot method by viewing the contents of the hidden EFI partition. To view the contents in the Finder, enter the following command.\ndiskutil mountvolume /dev/disk0s1\nAfter viewing the contents, you can hide the partition by entering the following command.\ndiskutil unmountvolume /dev/disk0s1\n\nWhat you are looking for is a folder labeled Windows. If found, then Windows probably was using the EFI boot method, otherwise the boot method was probably BIOS based.\nIf the wrong boot method is being used, then the partition tables need to be repaired. The proper steps to repair the tables depends on the contents of the tables. In other words, you will need to first post the output from the first set of commands given in this answer.\n", "Q: May use the San Francisco font for my web apps? I've found that new SF UI font for download (http://nomail.com.ua/font/SF%20UI%20Display). I wonder if it's legal to use it in the web app I am building now, i.e. for commercial use? I haven't found any licence info on the official page (https://developer.apple.com/fonts/). \n\nA: This question generally answers the question of legality.\nIncluding these font files in your app and using them with @font-face or @import is unquestionably not permitted.\nHowever, for a web app you can non-explicitly use it by specifying special keywords in your CSS:\nbody {\n  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Helvetica Neue\",\n      \"Lucida Grande\", \"Segoe UI\";\n}\n\nThis will, of course, result in slightly different appearances per platform and version (namely non-Apple platforms and Apple systems before iOS 9/OS X 10.11).\n", "Q: Cannot reinstall OS X.

I would not trust that, personally.\nDo you have access to a good internet connection? If so, you can use OS X Internet Recovery to install a fresh version of Mac OS X via your internet connection, directly from Apple.\n\nA: YES! You can either make a Genius Bar appointment or you can do a walk-in. If you do a walk-in for the genius bar you may have to wait a bit, but they will do it for free. The instillation may take a little while, so plan on having some free time and a good book (or movie or something - there's free in-store wifi).\nEach store typically has good internet and a local caching sever, so you are loading your OS Recovery and install images from the local network which makes it quite fast. Having the Genius Bar close by is just bonus if you don't know what to do or need advanced cleanup. \n\nA: On startup hold Command+Option+R. You can now use Internet Recovery to install OS X. Don't download from shady sites. You are compromising your security this way.\n\nA: I accidently wiped my hard-drive clean and when I tried both commandoptionR & commandR I found my recovery drive had been damaged as well and internet recovery would not complete (I do not remember the error I received).\nI was able to get the OS reinstalled at the Apple Store for free. I think your only problem might be getting 'walk-in' service. If there Apple Stores are as busy as the ones in the US getting an appointment well save you a few hours of waiting.\n", "Q: How to replace or delete entire iCloud photos library? My iCloud Photos library is corrupt. Photos are missing, the structure is broken.\nI have a backup of the local photos library with all full res images.\nI'd like to replace the entire content on iCloud with my local data but am unable to.\nMy library has more than 40,000 photos and is 200GB large.\nI tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new local, empty library -> it will download all from the cloud instead of replacing the cloud\n\n*Delete all from iCloud.com -> returns a server error during deletion\n\n*Delete in chunks of 1000 images -> \"succeeds\" but photos are not deleted\n\n*Of course I turned off iCloud photos on all of my devices\n\n\nAll I'd really like to have is a fresh start...possible? If yes, how?\n\nA: Since deleting directly in the browser did not work (I guess Apple never tested it with a library that large...), I ended up using this workaround: create a new Photos library (start Photos app with option key pressed). Make it the system library and sync with iCloud (only download previews). Then delete all photos and albums once the download has been completed. The changes will take about 15 minutes to be reflected in the browser.\nThen I switched back to my original library and enabled iCloud sync. Now it's uploading all of the >40,000 images back to iCloud.\n", "Q: Running Windows 7 from SD card on a Macbook Air This question has already been asked here before, but I feel I'm missing something or don't understand something from the answers.\nI have a MacBook Air - very little space left. I have a 128GB SD card. I want to dual boot Windows 7 and OSx. The Windows 7 would run from the SD card.\nI've prepared a USB drive with the Windows installation through Bootcamp assistant successfully, but then the \"Install or remove Windows 7\" checkbox is greyed out. It also gives me \"You must have at least 50 GB of space available\" message, but I want to install it on the SD card.\nDoes bootcamp not support writing on SD cards? Is there a workaround?\n\nA: One question posted at Ask Different deals with running Windows from a external drive. While the questions deals with Windows 10, the answer seems to indicate a BIOS boot method is used. Therefore, the answer might be adapted to work with Windows 7. Below is a link to this question.\nIs it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?\nIn your case, the problem really is not whether you can get the software to work, but rather the hardware media you are choosing. For a while now, Microsoft has had the ability to run Windows from a flash drive. This is referred to as Windows To Go. If you read the link, you will realize this requires the use of special flash drives design to endure the large amount of reads/writes required by the Windows operating system. A normal SD card probably would not survive long under such conditions.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Late 2011 13\" Display Issue I'm having a weird issue with the built-in display on a Macbook Pro Late 2011 13\".\nAs the lid is opened, the display usually activates normally at its threshold for turning on. Everything works fine. But if the lid is then opened all the way, the display dies.\nIf the lid is closed and opened again just until the display starts, then VERY slowly opened (like, a couple mm per minute) I can sometimes get the lid almost completely open while keeping the display alive. If it stays on, the display keeps running with no problems.\nDoes anyone have an idea where to start with an issue like this? Thanks for any help!\n\nA: It sounds like there is some problem with the connecting wires for the display. If you're okay how things are, then you can just leave things be. A repair would probably cost several hundred dollars.\nI have the same model Mac and also have display issues. When it was almost one year old, I noticed that the display would often go wonky (not turn off but look all weird like a light show), often if I were to open it all the way, if I recall. (So some problem with the internal wiring, probably different wires than yours though.) This was mainly a problem when I took it to class and was more prone to open the display all the way. So I quickly bought an extended warranty as someone from Apple predicted that my display issue would get worse and require a repair. But the issue never got worse, and I was always fine the way it was. I've been using this laptop for almost five years (still snappy!), and only very rarely do I experience this problem again, and the problem goes away by closing the lid and opening it more normally.\n", "Q: Adaptor/convertor parts for HDDs? I decided to swap my early 2011 MacBook Pro's HDD for a SSD and put that HDD in my G4 iBook. However, all of the guides I found used iBooks with an orange, cord-like HDD port (I don't know if port is the right word) like the one in my MBP. My iBook doesn't have such an port.\n\nThe part I am holding was connected to the iBook's HDD, allowing it connect the port.\nMy MBP HDD does not fit the adapter(?) piece or the HDD port:\n\nMy question(s): what these parts are actually called? Without the right vocabulary I'm having a hard time answering other questions like: Where can I get one? Do they make ones that would allow me to put the MBP HDD into the iBook?\n\nA: The difference is the HDD connectors. The iBook G4 uses an IDE (aka PATA) connector, whereas the MBP uses SATA. Unfortunately during a quick google search I wasn't able to find a SATA to IDE adapter that would fit inside the laptop case. It's probably worth looking for second-hand IDE hard drives or contacting someone at Apple to see if they have a better idea. If you want to buy a drive, try starting here: Ebay IDE laptop drives. Let me know if you have any questions or if I got any of my information wrong. \n\nA: There two basic hard disk interfaces. The legacy interface is called ATA, which transfers bits in parallel. This is probably what you found in your G4 iBook. I say this because the Everything Mac site show this type of interface for all G4 iBooks.\nThe new interface is called SATA, which transfers bits in serial. This is what is used in your 2011 MacBook Pro. This drive will not fit your G4 iBook. You could try to find an adaptor, but most likely there will not be enough space for such an adaptor in your iBook.\nTo determine the requirements for a replacement drive, you would have to include more information about your iBook model/year and/or the brand and model number of the drive.\n\nNote: Parallel ATA drives are also referred to as IDE and PATA drives.\n\n", "Q: MacBook stuck on black loading screen Today my MacBook Pro 2013 crashed so I hard reset it.\nSince then it boots to a black loading screen with the Apple logo and a loading bar in the middle. The loading bar progresses to around 60% then stops. \nI can't boot into recovery or safe mode and I've tried the usual troubleshooting steps to no avail.\nI'm at a loss because I can't even boot to internet recovery (it loads initially but then restarts).\nDo you have any advice on what I can try next?\nEdit: I'm not sure if this is related but the display also stopped working, I can only see the loading bar by plugging in an external monitor through the HDMI port.\nEdit 2: I can boot into single user mode run fsck -yf but this reports that Macintosh HD is OK\n\nA: When you don't get to a blue screen in the boot process, you can assume an OS reinstall should fix it. Your fsck results reinforce that as next step. \nI would boot to Internet recovery and download the OS installer of choice if your Mac supports that. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22136\nWhen that is done, next is\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21900\nThat article has the reinstall steps linked at the bottom. \n", "Q: Can Mac OS X Messages support more than one apple id? I have two Apple IDs, one for work and one personal. My iPhone's Messages settings are bound to my work id. When it receives messages, they pop up on my work computer pretty as you please.\nI would like that to happen on my home computer too. If I open Messages > Preferences > Accounts on my home computer, I see my home Apple ID listed (along with AIM and Bonjour). I would like to add my work Apple ID as well.\nWhen I click on +, I'm offered Google, Yahoo, Aol, and \"other\" as my choices. And under \"other\", the choices are \"AIM\", \"Jabber\", and \"Yahoo\"\nI was able to add my work account under Settings > Accounts, but there doesn't seem to be a way to connect that to Messages.\n\nA: AFAIK, this is not possible. You can add multiple E-Mail addresses to one AppleID (System Preferences -> iCloud -> Account Details -> Contact) , but you cannot use multiple AppleIDs for iMessage on one user account on a Mac.\n\nA: You can try going to Messages.app's Preferences (Messages > Preferences) from the menu bar.\nWithin it there should be a tab 'Accounts' for you to connect your work account to iMessage.\nIf your account appears greyed out, click it and check 'Enable this account'.\n\nA: Yes, you can. Go to settings>iCloud>account-details>contact. I hope it will help you\n", "Q: Extracting multiple photos from a single quickly I recently went through the process of scanning old photo albums (in an effort to preserve them longer digitized). I would place 2/3/4 photos on the scanner. Now I need to extract the single photos. It would also help if there was an application to quickly recognize the rectangles.\nN.B.: I'm running the latest beta of Sierra.\n\nA: You could use ImageMagick or NetPbm tools to crop the photos from a script, but it isn't going to automatically detect the rectangle edges.\nLay out your photos in roughly the same place every time you scan them. Leaving a small gap between the photos would give you a safety buffer; the resulting scanned/cropped photos will just have a white border around them.\n\nA: A couple of Mac OS apps do this: Snip (if you only need batch cropping) and SnipTag (for batch-cropping and editing image metadata). The workflow for both these apps is as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Capture 3-4 photos per scan using a scanner or digital camera\n\n*Save all such scans in a folder on your Mac\n\n*Import all the scans as a batch into the app\n\n*All the photos are cropped and saved as individual photos\n\n*Export the photos to Mac, external HD or cloud storage\n\n[Disclosure: I do customer service at AIL, developer of these apps.]\n", "Q: Can I move the Google Drive folder to a different volume? Is there a way to put the Google Drive folder on a different volume on my Mac (where I have more free space)?  I tried Googling the question, and just got tips about doing it on Windows.\n\nA: Method 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Preferences: menu bar -> Google Drive icon -> 3-dot icon\n\n*Choose Disconnect account in the Account tab. After you disconnect, your files will remain on your computer.\n\n*Sign in again by clicking the icon in the menu bar.\n\n*Step through until the last screen where you can setup up which folder to use.\n\n*Google Drive will download all/selected files to your computer.\n\n*You can delete your old files if you want.\n\n\nMethod 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Google Drive from the menu bar icon.\n\n*Move the folder to your preferred new location, rename it if you want.\n\n*Restart Google Drive.\n\n*It will warn you that the folder is missing, select the new folder and Google drive will sync to that folder.\n\n\nA: I figured it out.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Google Drive and remove the Google Drive folder.\n\n*Restart Google Drive.\n\n*Error message saying that it can't find the folder will pop up.\n\n*Click the error message text to open a dialog in which one can specify a new folder.\n\n*Specify your new folder location.\n\n\nA: You can move the drive folder to preferred location. Then quit the Google drive. The next start of google drive app you give you some error notification. After that you should have the error message. On click on this I've got nothing, but since you close it and clock on the gDrive - you'll see a grey folder icon and at the bottom a link that say find/specify google drive folder.

I'm running El Capitan on Mac OS X.\nMacBook would not boot (would hang on the Apple logo progress bar screen during start up).\nI brought it to Apple Store genius bar, guy said the hard drive is still functional but there was a warning on it so I should buy a new hard drive.\nI bought a new hard drive, installed it, installed El Capitan on it.

I popped the bottom case, discharged any static, undid the screws on the drive bracket, pulled the old drive and installed the new drive.\nAfter putting the Macbook back together, I booted from a USB thumb drive and launched disk utility. In DU, I can see the thumb drive, but I can't see the new hard drive at all. Booting from Internet Recovery is the same.\nWhat's more, I repeated all of these steps on a different Macbook, and the results were the same there -- drive not seen. Bad drive right out of the box, yeah? Rare, but it happens.\nSo I got a new drive, same capacity, different brand and same result: I don't see the drive in Disk Utility at all, no matter how I boot.\nI was thinking that these drives just needed to be formatted, even though both indicated they were Mac compatible, which I presume means pre formatted in FAT so both Mac and PC could read them. Is it possible that these drives are shipped raw and totally unformatted (first was Seagate STBD1000100, SATA III, second is Western Digital WDBMYH0010BNC-NRSN, SATA II)?\nIf they are indeed unformatted, how the heck am I supposed to format them when Disk Utility can't see them at all? I don't have an external drive available, but I suppose I can wrangle one with some shenanigans.\n\nA: You need to create a boot installer disk to setup a new disk as an internal boot disk for a Mac. You will need a running Mac system and a blank USB Thumb drive (at least 8GB in size). As long as you have that, here are the basics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading.\n\n*Mount your USB flash drive, or external drive with a 8GB or larger partition.\n\n*Open the Terminal (which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.)\n\n*Use the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the bootable installer.\n\n\nWARNING! This process will ERASE the USB thumb drive, so you can't have anything on it!\nFor El Capitan the command line would be as follows, where MyVolume is the name of your USB disk:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nAlso note that FAT formatted drives will NOT work as a Mac OS boot disk. They must be reformatted to Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) disk using a GUID Partition Table.\nTo learn more you can head over to Apple's website and read how to Create a bootable installer for OS X. As well as check out a simple walkthrough over on MacWorlds website on formatting a Mac boot disk.\n", "Q: Will updating OS X Server over VNC kill my VNC connection? I have a Mac Mini sitting in a remote location (another country).  To administer it, I use the screen sharing application.\nThere is an update for Server, which I would like to install.  However, when I click install, it warns:\n\nUpdating will stop any Server services that are running. Relaunch Server after the update completes to re-enable services.\n\nThe issue with that is that VNC is one of the services that Server is providing. My concern is that if Server stops, will I lose my VNC connection, and then be unable to relaunch Server?\nHow can I \"safely\" update Server using remote access tools?\n(The \"it's in a different country\" aspect precludes me from being adventurous and just trying it out).\n\nA: VNC is one of the base OS X services, and is not provided by Server.app. You can safely update Server if VNC is the only service you need to connect. I have updated server many times in the past over VNC.\nHowever, if you are using Server's VPN to make a secure connection and are running VNC on top of that, you may have problems. VPN is one of the services provided by Server.app, and it will be turned off when updating Server.\n", "Q: Downloading the Current EFI for the 2015 MacBook8,1 Model? I checked the Mac product download pages and found no new firmware updates for the new 2015 MacBooks. I found many for the MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, iMacs, and even the XServers, but the closest thing I found to \"MacBook\" firmware updates were for the older models. I looked at the release dates and they are relatively current. I would assume since Apple came out with the MacBook9,1 this year, they would have had EFI firmware download support for this newer model Mac.\nCan someone give me a hand?\n\nA: EFI updates are available from the command line:\nsoftwareupdate -la\n\nThis is the same information as the App Store app shows. The tools check apple's entire catalog and then calculate locally if any updates are required. You likely are up to date, but this is how to check. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518\n\nA: I would assume there are no updates for the 2015 and 2016 models. If there were, then such updates would appear at the Apple web site: About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers. I also assume that when an older model Mac is missing from the list, then this model has had no updates. For example, the MacBook6,1 (Late 2009) is missing. One issue with updates is that there is no software way to go backwards. So if you apply an update and wish to return to the original firmware, you would have to replace the logic board. Therefore, there is no reason for Apple to post a download of the original firmware. \nFor example, say your Mac was shipped with Version A of the firmware stored on the logic board. Assume Version B was installed and everything worked correctly. Now say Version C is released and appears on the Apple web site I referenced. If after applying Version C, you are not satisfied and wish to return to Version B. You would have to replace and logic board and apply the Version B update. There would be no reason for Apple to have ever posted for download Version A of the firmware.\n", "Q: Need help creating Automator Service to perform similar tasks to a residual uninstall I've been having an issue with a program I use heavily every day, where it it acts like it is recovering from a crash even when it was quit properly and all files saved. The app is FontLab Studio, not that it should matter.  What happens is that it loads all the files I've worked on recently, which can be several dozen, and even if I click out of them all, it happens several more times throughout the day.  Or, something causes it to crash as I'm exiting these files so that I have to relaunch and it starts all over.\nWhat I've been doing to avoid this, is to run AppCleaner, the free uninstaller, and delete everything but the App itself and the license info.  This works great, but given the frequency this is becoming necessary, I'd like to be able to create something I could access really  fast, like an Applescript that I could put in my dock.  Or an Automator service located in the contextual menu items.\nI don't know any Applescript, but I tried to make an Automator workflow. The first step, \"Get Selected Finder Items.\"\nOne has a static location, the second may change, I'm not sure.\n~/Library/Saved Application State/com.fontlab.studio5.savedState\n/var/db/BootCaches/34D6C504-2F5B-416F-9C91-0C9D019BF446/app.com.fontlab.studio5.playlist\nThe second step in the workflow is to move to the trash, and that's where it fails.  I suspect because these require a password?  If possible,  it would be great if I could enter it once and it remember, otherwise, how I'll need it to prompt me to enter my passkey.  I don't know the best way to do any of this.\n\nI just had another thought, though it may not work as it would require FontLab to be open at the time, would be to accomplish this with a Python script, because FontLab is partially built in python and can install third party scripts.  I am open to whatever help anyone could offer. \nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I do not have FontLab Studio installed however for the purpose of providing a solution to your situation, under OS X El Capitan 10.11.5, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a Terminal at /private/var/db/BootCaches, using sudo, mkdir and touch I created a directory named 34D6C504-2F5B-416F-9C91-0C9D019BF446 and in that directory a file named app.com.fontlab.studio5.playlist.\n\n*In Finder, in my Home folder's Library > Saved Application State folder, I duplicated a folder and renamed the copy to: \"com.fontlab.studio5.savedState\"\nIn doing so this replicated the target locations and files with appropriate privileges to then test the following AppleScript application on.\nIn Script Editor I used the following code to create the Reset FontLab Studio.app and saved it in the Applications folder of the Macintosh HD and then dragged it to the Dock so as to have it readily available to click on.\n\ntry\n    do shell script \"rm -r \\\"$HOME/Library/Saved Application State/com.fontlab.studio5.savedState\\\" /private/var/db/BootCaches/*/app.com.fontlab.studio5.playlist\" with administrator privileges\nend try\n\n\nWhen I click on the Reset FontLab Studio Dock Tile it showed the password dialog box, as shown below, for me to type in my password. I typed in my password and pressed enter. That's it, the app did what it was programmed to do.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*As this code is tested I'd suggest copying and pasting it as is into Script Editor and then saving it as an application of whatever name you desire.\n\n*$HOME is being used because ~ can/will at times error out in AppleScript and or Automator, depending on its specific use. Normally ~ is expanded to the value of Environment Variable of HOME and thus I typically use $HOME over ~ to avoid errors that it can/will generate at times.\n\n*The substitution of * for 34D6C504-2F5B-416F-9C91-0C9D019BF446 is intensional, so as to accommodate the possible name change.\n\n*The try command is used so as to avoid an error if you run the Reset FontLab Studio app again before the target files are recreated and or if one or the other doesn't exist, it still deletes the other.\n\n*/var is a symbolic link to /private/var however I prefer using the absolute path over the symlink in cases such as this.\n\n*The use of the rm command is inherently dangerous, especially when used with elevated privileges and or wildcards, so to that end make absolutely sure there are no typos in your command line and that the targets are the intended targets.  This is why I tested my code before posting it.  You can also preface the rm command with echo, e.g echo rm ... and then review the output in the Script Editor's Events/Results pane and then remove echo before saving the script.\n\nThe image below it to show syntactical highlighting and to see the full command line of the do shell script command \n\n\nIf you're the only user of the computer and you like not to have to type in your password when the Reset FontLab Studio app runs, then modify the do shell script command using the following syntax:\ndo shell script \"command\" user name \"me\" password \"mypassword\" with administrator privileges\n\nExample:\ndo shell script \"rm -r \\\"$HOME/Library/Saved Application State/com.fontlab.studio5.savedState\\\" /private/var/db/BootCaches/*/app.com.fontlab.studio5.playlist\" user name \"me\" password \"mypassword\" with administrator privileges\n\nNote that when the script's code is saved the value of user name and password are saved in readable text within the application bundle's \"main.script\" binary file. So use this method at your own risk as it is considered to be a security risk storing user names and passwords that are stored in an unencrypted manner.\n", "Q: iPad and Android phone Okay, I've got a problem. So I'm going to get a new phone, the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2016), because I'm just tired of my iPhone 4 not being up to date anymore. But my iPad (mini 2) is synced with my iPhone, like the same apple ID, same apps, maybe the same bill. If I've got my Samsung, my iPad won't sync with that, so I can't use my iPad anymore, what do I do?! Do I have to get a new simcard for one of them, a new number (I probably don't want to transfer my data from my iPhone to Samsung because it's just way to much with 8.000 photos), do I have to get a new number? Help\n\nA: You are mixing two things here:\n\n\n*\n\n*the SIM in your iPhone is tied to whatever contract you have with your carrier. Transfering this SIM to a new phone should be possible without much hassle (you may need to get a new physical SIM card maybe if the Samsung uses a different format than your iPhone). Moving the SIM card to a new phone will not impact the data stored on either the iPhone nor the iPad\n\n*Your apps (and photos if you use iCloud) are tied to your Apple ID. If they are already synced between the iPhone and the iPad, they will still be available on your iPad after moving from iPhone to Samsung. The photos (and any other data tied to your Apple ID) will not be available on the Samsung phone though\n\n\nPS: If you look for ways to sync data between the iPad and the Samsung phone, please search the site for previous questions or ask a new one. It might help to be rather specific about the kind of data you want to sync, solutions for photos may very well differ from syncing contacts or accessing iCloud mail from Android.\n", "Q: Does a black screen save battery on a macbook? I've seen some similar questions about iPhone on this site, but none of them focus on macbook, so here comes this one.\nThe picture below is a screenshot of my current desktop, with menu bar and dock hidden, as well as grey scale turned on. \n\nCan some pattern (black specifically) save enough energy on a macbook that you’d get more than 5 minutes runtime in a full battery to discharge cycle?\n\nA: No. No battery will be saved regardless of what color your screen is. This only applies when the screen is OLED, like in the Apple Watch. \nYou can save battery by lowering the screen brightness, though.\n\nA: No battery will be saved regardless of what color your screen is - agreed. however, personally, although, I prefer white text on black background, I feel more comfortable at lower brightness with black text on white background\n\nA: \nCan doing so save some energy on a macbook?\n\nNo.\n\nApproximately how much energy can be saved?\n\nNone\n\nConversely, what if I have a plain white(#FFFFFF) desktop picture?\n\nIt makes no difference. No energy will be saved. Your energy depends on screen brightness, not color.\n", "Q: Health Data is suddenly using a lot of iCloud Storage on iOS 10 I've noticed that since I've upgraded to iOS 10 public beta, Health Data is using 275mb of my iCloud storage (and it's increasing), which I think is much more than usual.\nAs far as I can recall, it was less than 10mb on iOS 9. Any ideas on why it's eating up iCloud storage and how to resolve this issue?\n\nA: I don't really know what else you can do about it, except don't back it up. This really feels like a bug/optimization problem on Apple's side. \nMine is 655MB and I'm pretty sure it was ~500 just a week or two ago. \n", "Q: How can I get photos in iPhone by wire? I need to get photos from my Mac to my iPhone, but best way I found was by AirDrop, but it is too slow (I need to transfer lot of photos).\nI would think that it would be faster by wire, but I didn't find any way...\n\nA: Let iTunes do that for you, check how to do it here in the apple documentation\nHere's what the overall steps are as described in the link in case it dies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that you have the latest version of iTunes.\n\n*Open iTunes on your computer.\n\n*Use the included USB cable to connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer.\n\n*Click on the device icon in iTunes.\n\n*Click Photos in the sidebar.\n\n*Click the box next to \"Sync Photos.\" If instead you see \"iCloud Photos is On,\" all your photos and videos are already on all of your devices that use iCloud Photo Library. You don't need to sync them through iTunes.\n\n*In the drop-down menu, choose the app or folder that you want to sync from.\n\n*Choose to sync all photos or selected albums. \nSelect \"Include videos\" to sync the videos from your app or folder too.\nClick Apply.\nThere are also 3rd party apps like RollIt that does that job too without iTunes, however it's paid\n", "Q: Clear all messages from current Terminal session In a Terminal window, if I issues a \"clear\" command it clears the screen.  But if I scroll up, the messages are still there.\nIs there a way to clear call completely?  Currently, I have to close and reopen the Terminal again to achieve this.\n\nA: To completely clear the screen in Terminal, so there is no scroll back, you can either use the menu and click Edit > Clear to start or use the keyboard and press: command-K\n", "Q: iPhone plays/pauses/skips songs and activates siri only when connected to earphones I have had my iphone 5s (still have version 7.1.1) for three years now and never have encountered such a problem until recently. \nWhen I plug my earphones, it works well depending on whether i want to facetime or play music but lately, it frequently stops, skips, pauses songs or activate Siri on its own accord. It even ends my facetime calls while i'm talking, so i have to call back every time (I can call back for more than 7-10 times). \nCan someone help me??? \nPS: it never does this when its not connected to my headphones\n\nA: You need a new headset.\nThe symptoms you are describing is because the \"controller\" assembly of your headset (the part that has the buttons and the microphone) is failing; most likely due to moisture (or some other contaminant) getting in and interfering with the circuitry.\n\nI have had this happen to me on several occasions and not just limited to Apple headsets.    Get a good quality headset that is also water resistant like the Bose SoundSport and you shouldn't have this problem again.  (Going on 4 years with my Bose where I wouldn't last a year with the regular ones).\n\nA: The problem seems to be the headphone jack plug. If you put an adaptor (3.5mm female to 3.5mm male) in between the headphones and iPhone/ iPod, it'll solve the problem. I found a 100mm adaptor on eBay for £2. Hope this helps. \n\nA: It could be as simple as lint build-up in the headphone jack, I had the same problem. Gently clean out the inside of the jack with a paper clip or similar item (I used lead from a mechanical pencil because I was at school). I pulled out two clumps of lint and the problem stopped. Don't worry about damaging the jack. As long as you don't jam something in there or get anything stuck you won't hurt it. Good luck.\n", "Q: Add urls to a list via Automator What is the simplest way to append a list of urls with a selected URL when browsing either chrome or safari. I tried to do this with automator and it was easy to achieve by creating a service with a Write Text to File action (from an add on package). But it does not add a new line after each entry. It doesn't even write a space after an entry. So you end up with a file like\nhttp://example./Ahttp://example.com/Bhttp://example.com/Chttp://example.com/Dhttp://example.com/Ehttp://example.com/F\n\nMy next attempt to use a Split Text action somehow resulted in 100 new files being created, each containing a single URL. (>_<) \nWhat I'm trying to achieve is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select a URL in the browser's (chrome or safari) address bar\n\n*Right click the highlighted URL to get to the services menu \n\n*Click on the created service (we'll call it Add to List)\n\n*Add the selected URL to text file in the Home folder followed by a new line.\n\n\nThe desired output being:   \nhttp://example.com/A\nhttp://example.com/B\nhttp://example.com/C\nhttp://example.com/D\nhttp://example.com/E\nhttp://example.com/F\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: This seems like an effective solution. A single Automator Run AppleScript action with the following script: \nset text item delimiters to linefeed\nset my_list to \"/Users/username/Documents/URL_list.txt\"\ntell application \"Google_Chrome\" to set new_items to (get the URL of the active tab in window 1) as string\ndo shell script \"echo  \" & quoted form of new_items & \" >>  \" & quoted form of my_list\n\ndisplay dialog new_items with title \"Added to the list\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save as a service\n\n*Service receives selected URLs\n\n*Input is only URLs (probably doesn't matter)\n\n*Tested and working in both Safari and Google Chrome\n\n\n*\n\n*If using Safari change the get the URL of the active tab in window 1 to get the URL of the current tab in window 1.

Help needed deciphering console crash log For a few days now my Macbook Air seems to hang for a second every five seconds or so. It is only noticeable in my browsers. Chrome, FF and Safari all have the same issue where the browser just locks up for a second before continuing. I looked in console and it is the same crash report being generated every five to ten seconds. The beginning of the log mentions a process x3d:\nProcess:               x3d [3646]\nPath:                  /private/etc/.x3/x3d\nIdentifier:            x3d\nVersion:               ???\nCode Type:             X86-64 (Native)\nParent Process:        launchd [1]\nResponsible:           x3d [3646]\nUser ID:               0\n\nDid some searching but came up empty handed.

I was having the same issue with the same crash log for the last few days. I took it to the Apple Store for that and another unrelated issue with my display. They cleared out the cache folder for Chrome, and the issue quit just like that. No more freezing browser, no more crash logs. I was a little embarrassed I hadn't tried that, when I'd tried just about everything else I could think of. There seemed to be a chrome and/or x3d daemon that was hanging. Hopefully that will clear up your problem as well. \n\nA: I hope you figured this problem out by now, but I had this issue with the x3 Watch accountability software. I had similar reports in my console, and discovered x3d was for the x3 Watch software daemon. Something was regularly crashing (like you mentioned, every 5-10 seconds) and really bogging my whole machine down, particularly on the browser (which makes sense - it's where the software functions most). Once I uninstalled the software, the problem was solved.\n", "Q: Where can I order a replacement screen for a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)? I'm selling my MacBook but I want to replace the screen first so that I can sell it as like new.\nThe rear of the screen (the side with the Apple logo) has some chips.\nWhere can I order a replacement screen for a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014), or is there a reputable UK company that I can send it to to have it done?\n\nA: The best place that I have sourced replacement/upgrade parts for my Apple products has been Amazon. A quick search for your part resulted in a number of good sources.\nI have used eBay in the past and more often than not there were severe quality/customer service issues.  Buying through Amazon, has been much more efficient and customer service focused.  \nGiven that Amazon has sites in the US and the EU (including UK after Brexit) you should have no problem sourcing through them.\nThe repair itself isn't very difficult if you have some basic experience.  ifixit.com has an excellent tutorial.  You won't need to remove the logic board (thankfully) but you will need to disconnect some components, especially the battery.\nFor this particular model, you will need a pentalobe screwdriver as Apple stopped using the standard Philips screws.\n\nA: I would very strongly recommend against that. You will never, ever get your money back. It's a 2014 MacBook. That's no age for the screen. But if it is replaced, it is not \"as new\", it is a 2014 MacBook with a screen that was repaired. I wouldn't want a MacBook where the screen is repaired, I'd rather have the original screen, with nobody messing around with the innards of the MacBook, causing god knows what damage. That's what any potential buyer would think. \n", "Q: How can I connect to the internet by sim card? I have a ipad mini 2 and I can connect to the internet via WiFi as well. My ipad is cellular model and I've putted a sim card in it. But when I turn off the wifi, the internet will be die and I cannot open a web page. Here is my screen shots:\n\n\n\nOk well as you see, my sim card supports 3G technology but sadly I cannot use the internet via the sim card's internet connection. What's wrong and how can I create a internet connection based on the sim card?\n\nA: The first thing you should do is make sure that your model iPad supports the cellular network you're trying to connect to.\nIn America, we have two major cellular networks, GSM and CDMA. I suspect that this is the heart of your issue.\nApple's support website has a webpage that helps identify your model so you can continue troubleshooting.\nIf push comes to shove, you'll need to either call your cell provider or go into one of their stores to have them resolve the issue by either giving you a new SIM or reactivating the device on their network.\n", "Q: How to change keyboard setting when app changes I am currently learning the Dvorak keyboard at the moment so I need to change keyboard when I am not in the training application 'Type Fu'.\nWhat I want to do is:\n1) Have the Dvorak - QWERTY ⌘ when I am in the 'Type Fu' application\n2) Change to the QWERTY keyboard when I am in any other application  \nLater on when I have learnt it, I would like this to happen:\n1) Have the Dvorak - QUERTY ⌘ keyboard for all applications apart from developer environments such as Xcode and Terminal\n2) Automatically switch to Programmer Dvorak when I am in developer environments such as Xcode and Terminal\nI know that the second option I want is similar to the first, however it has more exceptions.  \nIs it posible to do this in any way (even by downloading third party software)? This would make it so much easier when I am learning the new layout and when I change from programming environments to non-programming environments.\nI know other questurns like this have been asked before, however, (https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/222844/automatically-change-keyboard-layout-based-on-app-focus) does not have an answer (or any comments) and (Auto change keyboard layout based on application focus) does not change per application, only per document. This means if I were to create more tabs in my enviroments, it may or may not switch to the correct one. \n\nA: Since you mentioned that you could use 3rd party apps you should have a look at Keyboard Maestro, allowing you to create macros and triggers. For example you could have Keyboard Maestro switch to the Dvorak keyboard whenever you are using Type Fu.\nHere is how I would go about this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Macro called \"Switch to Dvorak\".\n\n*Pick \"Application\" trigger and select Type Fu.\n\n*Select \"Set keyboard Layout\" Action.\n\n", "Q: Terminal \"open\" any image results in \"Preview quit unexpectedly\" Whenever I hit open blah.png (any image type) in my terminal, I get a message \"Preview quit unexpectedly\" from Mac OS X. The solution is to just open the folder in Finder using open ., navigating to the file and opening it from there. Preview seems to work fine then. However, this is annoying. \nAny ideas why I can't open images from the terminal?\nMy OS X version is 10.10.5 (14F1808). By the way, when I hit ``open receptor.png'' (where receptor.png is the filename), the terminal now also says: \"LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Users/asdf/receptor.png.\" I don't know why I didn't notice that before.\n\nA: There are a number of cache-type files that will clear most issues with Preview, if you delete them.  I've also heard of several similar issues arising out of ACL (Access Control Lists) being out of sync across your system.  \nFirst reset the ACL for your account, like this.  Use this as a more detailed reference as needed.  Just to remedy Preview.app  issues, You probably do not need to remove all the permissions on your account, so ignore their first step where they are using chmod in the terminal.  I would reccomend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart the computer, and on the chime, hold down Cmd+R\n\n*At the top of the screen, chose \"Utilities\" --> \"Terminal\"\n\n*In Terminal type resetpassword (you can also use one of your old passwords)\n\n*Click on \"Save\"\n\n*Press \"Reset\" (just below), which resets the Access Control Lists.\n\n\nNow login to your computer, and remove the Preview cache & preference files.  I've used this link as a reference to confirm the locations:\nOpen Finder and then navigate to your User Library by holding alt, and chosing from the \"Go\" menu at the top, \"Library.\"  If you're confident with the terminal, of course you can also delete them that way.  For example:  cd $HOME/Library/ then rm -Rf [each file below].  Don't use terminal if you are not used to it!\nclear the various caches and temporary files related to Preview by deleting:\n\n\n*\n\n*'Containers/com.apple.Preview'  \n\n*'Containers/com.apple.quicklook.ui.helper'  \n\n*'Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist'\n\n*'Preferences/com.apple.Preview.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plist'\n\n*'Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState'\n\n\nDO NOT OPEN PREVIEW BEFORE LOGGING OUT WITHOUT PERSISTANCE AND RESTARTING.\nNow, do a complete shutdown of your system, bring it back up.  This fixes most non-critical issues with Preview.app.  Make sure that when you shutdown, the box is not checked \"remember my open programs.\"\nIf these steps do not solve the problem, assuming you are not running cracked or unauthorized software, you should reinstall OSX or seek professional help from an Authorized Apple Support center, because the problem is quite unusual and could be serious.\n", "Q: Shortcut to disable keyboard/mouse in OSX On more than a few instances, I have accidentally disabled the internal keyboard and trackpad by a shortcut. \nThe only button which works is the power-up key which I can use to wake up (if it's in sleep mode) and force quit by holding it. \nMy question is, which keyboard shortcut (or keyboard and mouse click combination) does this effect and what can you do to undo it?

Is there any other way to delete the certificate or add it to authorized issuer's list.\nPreviously I had the same issue and I was able to resolve it by deleting the expired certificate. After that I created another user account and I am facing the above issue in the new user account that I created. I am not able to find the expired certificate in the new user account that I created.\n\nA: Right click on the app (or two finger click), and open it. You will then get the option to click Open again. Double clicking it won't allow you to open unregistered developer's app.\n\nA: I am a Mac and iOS Developer. As I understand, an active Developer account is necessary to keep certificates up to date whether your app is distributed through the App Store or privately. \nHere is a descriptor of certificates from Apple's site: \"You will need to set up certificates to develop and distribute Mac apps. To submit your app to the Mac App Store or distribute it outside of the Mac App Store, it must first be signed with an Apple-issued certificate. Certificates allow the system to identify who signed the app.\"\nIt sounds like one of two things has occurred. One, your company never went through the steps to get a certificate from Apple. Two, the certificate has expired. \nIf you're having trouble running the application issued by your company, and it's on a Mac, you can go to System Preferences > Security > General. Click the lock-symbol in the lower left and input your password to unlock these settings. You can then change the security to \"Anywhere\" while you run the app the first time. Make sure you switch it back as this will remind you in the future if you have downloaded something from the internet that might have questionable origins.\nYou might also want to bring this to your company's developer. They can submit a request for a new certificate so this issue does not continue.\n", "Q: How to find the running TFTP Server process name?

For example:\nif /usr/bin/sudo launchctl list com.apple.tftpd ; then\n    echo \"tftpd is on\"\nelse\n    echo \"tftpd is off\"\nfi\n\n\nA: The TFTPD is a service which means that the executable is started on demand when an incoming connection is made. To see whether your Mac will respond i.e. whether the TFTPD service is active you can use the following command in Terminal or shell script. Note that admin privileges are not needed for this type of query:\nlaunchctl print system/com.apple.tftpd\n\nThis will produce a configuration output if the service is active like this:\ncom.apple.tftpd = {\n   active count = 0\n   path = /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist\n   state = waiting\n   [...cut for brevity...]\n   system service = 1\n   }\n}\n\nor an error like this:\n\"Could not find service \"com.apple.tftpd\" in domain for system\"\n\nWhich would mean that the service has not been or cannot be started. If all that you are interested in is running/not running state then it's easiest to check for error message or the non-zero errorlevel returned. Errorlevel 0 means TFTPD service active, non-zero means not active. For example, if the launchd is not loaded at all errorlevel number 113 is returned which means: \"Could not find specified service\" \n", "Q: El Capitan install from usb stuck at boot Trying to install a clean version of El Capitan from a USB stick to an empty hard drive. I'm unable to boot to the Installer though, it just gets stuck with the Apple logo and the progress bar underneath. The progress bar fills up completely, but then nothing happens. Waited over an hour now. Anything I can try to get past it?\nIt's a 2008 Late Aluminium Macbook.\nThanks\n\nA: If you have access to another mac, try this. Hold down the T key during boot on the mac with new hard drive installed. This will put that machine in target boot mode. \nConnect the two Macs with either a fire wire cable or a thundbolt cable. \nOn the 2nd mac run the El Capitan installer. When asked where to install the OS point it at the other mac (with new hard drive installed) which should now be seen in finder. If it does not show up in finder. Launch disk utility and format the drive. \nIt sounds as if the USB installer is broken. However as long as you have access to another mac you do not need to make another usb installer. Just download El Capitan from the app store and follow the above instructions. \n\nA: What OSX did you have before?\nIf you want to do this without having ever upgraded from Leopard or Snow Leopard, it will not work I guess (not 100% sure).\nThe progress bar first indicates reading the firmware, after that it (tries to)read the OSX (installer in this case).\nAre you sure the empty drive is correctly formatted, GUID Partition Table, and, Mac OS X Extended (journaled).\n", "Q: How to find which shared library is loaded by a process on OSX?

The Telstra modem doesn't have enough grunt/range to reach another room for me to use my iPad there. In a previous house we connected the Time Capsule to another type of Telstra modem by Ethernet cable and the Time Capsule acted as router. It sent the signal throughout a two storey house.\nCan I do the same with this setup and what do I have do on the Macbook to make it all work?\n\nA: It is certainly possible to set up your Time Capsule as your sole router even when your modem is a router/modem combo.\nSetup\nPart 1: setting up the Time Capsule normally\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Airport Utility on your Mac (if you already have downloaded it, ensure it's version 5.3 or later).\n\n*Connect your Telstra modem to the WAN port of your Time Capsule via an Ethernet cable.\n\n*Connect the Time Capsule's power cable to an AC outlet.\n\n*Open the Airport Utility app on your Mac (search Spotlight for it or go to the Utilities subfolder of your Applications folder).\n\n*The Time Capsule will have an initial name (such as \"Time Capsule fea88c\"). Click continue to proceed.\n\n*Select \"Create a new wireless network\" and click Continue.\n\n*Follow the rest of the on-screen instructions (you'll probably want to use the same SSID/Password for your new network as your old one had). When finished, your Time Capsule will restart and apply your settings.\n\n\nNow your Time Capsule is broadcasting WiFi. Problem is, so is your Telstra router/modem.\nPart 2: turning off the router portion of the Telstra.\n\n\n*Find your Telstra router's local IP address (this page might help). NOTE: It is probably 10.0.0.138, but may also be 192.168.0.1 (or something else even!).\n\n*Type this IP address into your browser's address bar.\n\n*You should see a setup page for your Telstra router/modem (if you don't, you have the wrong IP address from step 8).\n\n*Find the WI-FI section: \n\n*In the WI-FI section, navigate to both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz tabs, and in each uncheck Enabled. \n\n*Test that you successfully disabled your Telstra modem/router's routing capabilities by unplugging the Time Capsule. If your internet connection drops, and your devices go offline, you're all set.\n\n*Plug your Time Capsule back in and enjoy.\n\n\n\nYour sole router should now be the Time Capsule.

If a contact is placed on the blocked list, the messages are no longer received; but they will stay so and not appear at a later time. If the contact is placed on do not disturb, there is simply no notification and the texts are still received. If the phone is put into Airplane Mode and is not connected to wi-fi, no messages are received at all. Is there a middle way between these two where the contact messages are blocked for the current time being and received later? \n\nA: Not really. You can schedule do not disturb but not schedule a change of a contact from favorite to not favorite, so that option blocks all non-favorites on a temporary basis. \n", "Q: Why do I see words when I press shift+esc on Chrome address bar?

Hope this helps :) \n", "Q: Windows like Restore option in OSX Windows provide a facility to restore state of OS in case of getting corrupt by loading it up from Hard drive. Is there anything like that available for OSX?\n\nA: No, Windows offers different recovery features than OS X.\nParticularly Windows is creating automatic (and allowing manual creation of) system restore points.\n\nRestore points are created to allow users a choice of previous system states. Each restore point contains the necessary information needed to restore the system to the chosen state. Restore points are created before key changes are made to the system.\n\nThese restore points are actual copies of the registry, device drivers, and other configuration and take up disk space on the system drive.\n\nWith OS X no such system-level backups are taken (or no control over them is given to the user).\nInstead Apple takes a different approach in which it protects the core system files and configuration by making them immutable or by observing tough control over their modifications.\nSIP (System Integrity Protection) with respect to file system protection in theory ensures that applications and unsigned drivers installed by the user won't mess (either maliciously or through negligence) with the core system configuration so that it will always boot to a good state (and the need for restoring to the last known good state would be eliminated).\n\nEither Windows or OS X allow system reinstall without deleting user files.\n\nA: Not really.\nThe closest thing is Time Machine, which will make a snapshot of your system every hour either to your local hard disk or to a nominated backup drive (locally or network attached). Older backups are automatically thinned out; specifically, Time Machine will keep:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local backups as space permits\n\n*Hourly backups for the past 24 hours\n\n*Daily backups for the past month\n\n*Weekly backups for all previous months\n\n\nand it will delete the oldest backup to make room for the newest one, if it has to.\nHowever, Time Machine backups, and the applications used to access those backups, are optimised for restoring either individual files (e.g. in case of accidental deletion or corruption) or your entire system (as one step in the OS X re-installation process). There is no real in-between where you can easily just roll back your system to how it was working a couple of days ago, or to just before you reconfigured something.\n\nA: Yes, OS X does provide this. To access this you need to hold down the command + R keys when you push the on button to start up your mac, from there you should be able to reinstall, wipe, or restore from backup. Hope this helps you :)\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201314\n", "Q: How to backup photos from iPhone What should be the proper way to backup photos from iPhone. iCloud do not have much storage for it, any apps is recommended to use for backup photos? I heard a lot of users use Google Photos for backup photos, is that reliable? \n\nA: Google Photos lets you store unlimited photos in high quality on their servers, just by downloading the Google Photos app. The app works great, and I've found it to be reliable. It gets 5 stars in the iOS App Store (which is really quite an achievement) and has nice extra features in the Assistant section, like auto-making videos from your photos/videos. Once your photos and videos are backed up to Google Photos, you can view them on phones, tablets, and computers, just by signing in to your account.\nYou can also spend $1 a month to purchase 50 gigabytes of iCloud storage, and turning on iCloud Photo Library lets you back up all of your photos similarly (though I've found this to be slightly less reliable than Google's solution). \nRead more about backing up your photos with this New York Times article.\n\nA: Three options come to mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use iCloud to backup to iCloud Photo Library. Just go to settings, photos, and switch on iCloud Photo Library.\n\n*If you would like to backup to iTunes, just plug in your phone, open the photos app and click \"import images\". This will back them up to your Mac. \n\n*Lastly, you could just back up your iPhone. Doing a full backup would backup photos as well as everything else. This could get some complications though, for example if you wanted to restore from a different backup and wanted ONLY the photos from this backup. You can do it, but it's better to just use the photos app.\n\n\nA: With the default 5 GB of iCloud storage, you can get a backup of your photos by turning on Photo Stream, and leaving Photos running on your Mac. The Mac will get new photos and videos added to your PhotoStream continuously, but your phone and iCloud storage will be limited to a max of 1000 items.\n", "Q: Replace Demo content with fully functional one So I have iPhone 5c ME561LP/A with demo content. Can I replace the demo content with fully functional iOS?\n\nA: Probably, all you should have to do is wipe and restore it to the latest iOS version via iTunes:\n\nUse iTunes on your Mac or PC to restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to factory settings\nA factory restore erases the information and settings on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod and installs the latest iOS or iPod software. \n\n", "Q: What can you and can't you do with an apple watch that has activation lock My first question is what can you do and what can't you do with an apple watch with an activation lock. \nMy second question is how can I unpair the watch since the phone is a different location (I'm in South Africa and my brother is in New York with my phone). Is it possible to remove it from iCloud.com\nI have to give the watch back to my work since I'm leaving but I can't unpair it.

But there is a 'Manage apps that can look you up' section in the advanced settings on iCloud.com. Here you have a support article about it. \nCould not find anything else in iCloud that comes close. However it is a great feature request! You can give feedback about this to Apple.\n\nA: Answering my own question: this is currently not possible, there is no way to see what apps / services you have authenticated with using your Apple ID.\n\nA: If you logged into the app using your Apple ID and password directly (in the app itself / on its website, not on apple.com), then you cannot see a list, because those apps are signing in as you.\nIf you generated an app-specific password (which is needed for things like Mail and Calendar apps that connect to your iCloud) or if you used \"Sign in with Apple\" (where you click a link that sends you to apple.com to sign in), you can view a list of passwords at https://appleid.apple.com.

Would there be any drawback to setting him up as an \"under 13\" child so he doesn't have to use his school email?\n\nA: Why would you do this? When creating an Apple ID you are also creating an iCloud account. Just use the iCloud email generated as part of the process, or create a new email address for this purpose using any other free email service of your choice such as Gmail. (If you state he is underage, Apple will force you to use the iCloud email and will not allow you to use a non-Apple email for the account.)\n", "Q: Trying to Determine if MacBook Pro 2011 projects in 4:3 or 16:9 format during presentations The company I work for is hosting a corporate presentation next month. We have hired outside A/V services and he is asking me if I will be projecting in 16:9 or 4:3 and if we will need a 5k or 10k projector. From what I have found, I believe the 10k projector is necessary for the 16:9 aspect ratio.\nIs there anyway to determine which aspect ratio my MacBook Pro 2011 (OS X 10.9.5) would project in?\n\nA: Your native aspect ratio is 8 : 5. If you are using Keynote for Mac to present, click wide when picking your template, which can be blank. When being chosen as wide, it sets the ratio to 16:9.\n", "Q: How to uninstall application from iOS when there are many of them? How to uninstall some application from iOS?\nPlease don't say to press and to hold an app icon, because it is impossible to find it visually in my case. My child downloaded a lot of games and made a lot of folders.\nI need convenient way to delete application by it's name from alphabetically sorted list.\nIs this possible in iOS?\n\nA: You can plug it into iTunes and delete them from there by pressing uninstall, and apply.\nAlso, on newer iOS, you can just let iOS offload unused apps. Thirdly, you can now delete apps from settings app.\n\n*\n\n*settings > general > iPad storage\n\n\nA: If you search for the app by name in Spotlight, the name of the folder that contains it will be shown next to the app. Then you can find it in the folder and delete it. See the example here, showing that Pages is in the Writing folder. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15'' (Mid 2010) regularly crashes for unknown reason My MacBook Pro suddenly began crashing regularly, and I

A full hardware diagnostics was run, no faults detected.\nAny ideas what might be wrong and how I can try to fix it?\nUpdate (26.07.16):\nI have now reset the NVRAM and SMC. I'll post an update if it works or if the issue still persists.\nUpdate (27.07.16):\nNope. Resetting NVRAM and SMC didn't help. The same crash still occurs.\n\nA: Found a solution that seems to be working in my case.\nGo to Energy Saver (in System Preferences) and disable Automatic graphics switching.\nThis will affect performance, of course, but I haven't experienced any crashes since I did this.\n\nA: This is a known problem from Apple. I made a program to fix this issue. You can check it out here, it's free and open-source: https://github.com/julian-poidevin/MBPMid2010_GPUFix/\nGist of the above page to give more background to the solution:\nMBPMid2010_GPUFix is an utility program that allows to fix MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) intermittent black screen or loss of video. The algorithm is based on a solution provided by user fabioroberto on MacRumors forums.\nThe bug is in hardware: it's due to a bad type choice on a decoupling capacitor used on GPU motherboard part \nIt has been detected that the problem happens every time that G-State change between 2 to 0.\nG-States go from 0 to 3, are related to the thresholds inside AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext, like this:\nG-state 0 (maximum speed)\nG-state 3 (lowest speed).\nThe problem can be 'solved' by keeping it always at G-State 2 (medium speed).\nThe linked program automates this task.\nAlthough: as stated that the bug is manifest in hardware, the best fix is to replace this tiny and cheap component. \nThe software workaround lowers the performance of the chip.\nThe hardware fix will restore the machine to advertised specs.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 Plus cannot add calendars On an iPhone 6 Plus the calendar app will not allow me to add calendars nor edit calendars.  The \"+\" sign is grayed out!  What can be done?\n\nA: You can't add calendars in the Calendar app, only in Settings. To add an event, you should have a calendar set up in Settings. \nIf you do have calendars set up, make sure they are visible by going to the Calendars button at the bottom center in the Calendar app. Select \"Show All Calendars\" and see if you can now add events.\nIf you don't have a calendar set up, go to the Settings app, then iCloud, and make sure you enabled Calendars. Or you can add your own calendars from Outlook, Gmail etc. at Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Add Account.\nLet us know if you succeeded. :)\n", "Q: How to prevent Cmd-Q from typing \"q\" in the new foreground app? My background app (the one that gets activated when the current app quits) is some text editor. When I use the Cmd-Q shortcut to quit it and immediately afterwards let go of only the Cmd key, the text editor types a q character.\nOf course I normally don't intentionally keep Q pressed. While using the Quartz keyboard layout I never even noticed this, but when I changed to the Dvorak layout, I occasionally saw this happen (probably because of the location of Q on the keyboard). It happens with both layouts though.\nI'm pretty sure it's not a problem with specifically my Mac (EDIT: It only happens with my Logitech keyboard). It's quiet annoying, especially while coding since I quit the developing app a lot and the q in my source code makes it not compile anymore.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does this only happen on my Mac? Can someone test this? It only happens with the Logitech keyboard.\n\n*How can I prevent this from happening? (other than always paying attention to let go of Q before Cmd)\n\n*Why is this even happening? I don't think it's supposed to be like this.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Tested and mine doesn't do this.\n\n*Try to turn off key repeat: (mine below is not off)\n\n\n\n\n\n*Maybe you have a non-Apple keyboard with anti-ghosting?\n\n\nA: I have this same problem, and can confirm that it only seems to happen when I'm using my Logitech keyboard.  I fiddled with lots of keyboard settings, but none of them stopped the errant \"q\" from happening.  But I've found a (poor) solution that does work:\nSolution:\nWhenever you press cmd+q, make sure you release the q key before releasing the cmd key.  As long as you release the keys in this order, the \"q\" character won't be sent to the new foreground app.\n", "Q: What are the requirements around account de-registration? When one uploads an app on the App Store, do you need to include a delete account (or even log out account) option? Is it required to wipe that data off the server? \n\nA: I don't believe so. In my app Free Bitcoin I don't provide a delete option (one can contact me through the app and I will manually remove their account), and log out is performed by removing and reinstalling the app. The app was approved by Apple without any trouble.\n", "Q: How do I ssh to MacBook Pro thru Fios then Time Capsule configured as a Bridge?

I've done port forwarding on the FiOS router to my MacBook Pro but attempts to SSH from outside produce \"network unreachable\" (inside my home network SSH works fine).\nIs the only way to get this to work by setting the Time Capsule configuration to DHCP & NAT then port forward from FiOS to the Time Capsule then port forward using the NAT configuration on the Time Capsule to the MacBook?\nI really want to leave the Time Capsule in Bridge mode because traffic between my TiVo boxes and Macs/iPhone/iPad only work in that configuration.\n\nA: I would remove any setup you made on the routers to set up DMZ host, port forwarding, ssh after making a backup / notes of how you have things configured.\n\n\n*\n\n*enable NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) or Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) on the FiOS router.\n\n*Set up the AirPort in Bridge Mode\n\n*Set up iCloud on the Mac to have Back To My Mac enabled (you can turn it off later - but this lets you use Apple's diagnostic test to verify NAT-PMP/UPnP are working on your specific network topology and settings.\n\n*Power down the mac, then the AirPort, then the router. If any have battery backups, consider powering them down too. Start up the router, wait 60 seconds or so, then the airport, wait 60, then the Mac.\n\n\nAt this point iCloud preferences will show an error condition if you don't have inbound access to the Mac.\nAt this point you can go off Apple's Help in Finder - search for \"Share your screen using Back to My Mac\" - it should show you detailed steps and troubleshooting if it doesn't work. - https://help.apple.com/machelp/mac/10.12/index.html?localePath=en.lproj#/mh15597\nTo test remotely, use another Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*sign in to the same iCloud account on that mac\n\n*open terminal\n\n*Shell menu - new remote connection\n\n*select ssh\n\n*select the host that is remote\n\n\nObserve the shell command like ssh -p 22 remoteMac.442113223.members.btmm.icloud.com.\nIf you can ssh in, then you know the router and the mac are set up to pass incoming ssh traffic on the default port 22 to the Mac connected to your router.\nAt that point, you can then think about making up tunnels or know if you are set up for IPv4 or IPv6 on the FIOS connection and routers.\n", "Q: \"XfinityWifi\" and \"PublicWifi\" are being added to my list of networks without my knowledge or consent (OS/X El Capitan ... MacBook Pro)\nFrom time to time, when I go to *System Preferences...Network...WiFi...Advanced,\" I find that two network-names have been added to the list without my knowledge or consent:\n\n\n*\n\n*XfinityWiFi\n\n*PublicWifi\n\n\nHow do I know this?   Heh ... \"Because I happen to live in a hole.\"   That is to say, \"a little corner of Northwest Georgia (USA)\" where there is exactly one wireless network: \"Mine!\"   I work from my home, so my computer rarely leaves it. \nI have turned off \"Remember networks that this computer has joined,\" and in any case I can positively say that this computer has never encountered, let alone \"joined,\" either of these networks.\nSo ... what's going on here?!\n\nA: Wireless networks are synced across iCloud, so if any other device such as an iPhone connects to these networks and is also signed in to the same iCloud account as your Mac, the networks will appear in this list.\n\nA: An article posted on dslreports.com last December stated:\nIn June of last year Comcast announced that the company was launching a new, Fon-like effort that involved new router firmware that turns your gateway into a publicly-accessible hotspot. More specifically, updated routers would now offer two signals: one being yours, and the other being a \"xfinitywifi\" SSID signal providing free Wi-Fi to other Comcast users in your general area.\nThe article also adds: Fortunately, users can disable this functionality if they don't want to share their bandwidth with strangers, but Comcast says this functionality is enabled by default. The public usage also thankfully doesn't count against your Comcast usage cap (if you have one in your market), and Comcast will push more bandwidth your direction to compensate for additional strain on your line.\nHowever, as we've been noting the program's opt out functionality doesn't always work and appears to reset after firmware updates. \nSo unless you buy your own cable modem/gateway device, you're going to have to live with this turning itself back on after every firmware update to your rented cable modem even after you opt-out. \n", "Q: How to extract third party application data (mp3 files) from iPhone6 to Windows 10 computer I need to extract (download) from my iPhone 6 the data from third party application (mp3 files) to my Windows 10 PC. The data load to iPhone were from this third party application (radio.kartina) and were NOT using iTunes or any Apple applications.\nAny applications I can download to iPhone and/or PC to have this access?\nThe USB connection gives me access to photos (and videos) only, but I need to get these mp3 files from iPhone 6 to my Windows 10 PC.\nI would appreciate any help - name of application to use or detail instructions. Regards, Simon.\n\nA: iFunbox or iTools is the program you need to backup iPhone data to computer. iFunbox provides an easy way to manipulate app data in sanbox. Both of them are free programs and easy to use. \n\n\nA: As of iOS 8.3, Apple blocked access to files in applications that don't have \"iTunes File Sharing\" enabled. If the app in question supports this, then you can use iTunes to transfer the files off. If it doesn't, the best (and possibly only) solution is to back up your device and use a program on your computer such as iExplorer (or a similar application), and the \"Backup Explorer\" (again other apps may have a similar function), to browse your backup.\nI have not tested this and it may no longer work with the latest versions of iOS or iExplorer (or other similar app).\nIf you are running a version of iOS below 8.3 you can use iExplorer (or similar) to transfer the files from your device without backing up first.\n", "Q: X29 Proximity Temperature sensor What is the X29 Proximity (temperature) Sensor measuring? I'm on a 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina.\n\nA: The X29 Proximity Temperature sensor is used to monitor the heat that the CPU is producing, likely at different locations inside the computer, hence the word proximity.\n", "Q: Installing a linux application in OS X - source or via package mechanism? I'm looking at installing an application whose installation is supported on a few Linux distros via yum, rpm etc and from source. What I would like to know is given these possibilities, what would be the best way to install it on OS X? I'm only vaguely aware of Brew, Fink & pkgsrc. I only have beginner experience with package managers too. What I don't understand is once you install some variety of package manager, does the application have to have been \"packaged\" with one of those for it to be installable or, does it just use the package framework and (maybe) existing system libraries to produce what it needs on OS X with whatever package sources are available from the vendor?\nIt seems even with a source installation some form of package manager is needed given they list various library requirements as being met via issuing:\nyum install cmake gcc gcc-c++ libaio libaio-devel automake autoconf bison libtool ncurses-devel libgcrypt-devel libev-devel\n\n(There is also an apt-get equivalent provided as well).\nAlso - is it best to have a solution that leverages the installed system base libraries or provides its own copies? Would darwinup be a possibility for a source installation?\n\nA: To answer some of your questions (there are a lot!) \nNot all programs written for Linux will install on OSX nor will they necessarily even compile from source. \nWhat\"genre\" of programs are you looking for? Things with a GUI, or command line programs or scientific?\nIn general I would recommend usingbrew first, and seeing if you can find the program you want there. Fink and MacPorts, etc, have become far more problematic. \n", "Q: Does jailbreaking an iPhone have an impact on performance? I'm using iPhone 6s plus 64Gb with 9.3.3. Does jailbreaking have an effect on performance/speed?\n\nA: No. Jailbreaking itself doesn't cause slowness. It's what you do with that that causes trouble. And since you have a 6s.. I wouldn't bother jailbreaking it until iOS 10, since it's so close.\n\nA: I guess I would ask what features or functions are you hoping to gain. Back in the\"early\" days there were lots of reasons to jailbreak (besides just plain fun): 3rd party apps, springboard, customization, tethering, and other hacks. For me, iOS has acquired all the features that I got from jailbreaking, without the extra hassle. \n\nA: Unlike rooting android, which users perform to enhance performance by overclocking, upgrading to a better kernel, and customisation, iPhone is pretty well optimised in this aspect, so one of the obvious reasons someone would find a need to jailbreak it would be just the customisation. To clear your doubts, this will not slow down your device but could sometimes make it unstable when some unsupported tweaks are installed. Rest assured jailbreaking is fun. But for an iPhone 6s which is already very fast and optimised, there is hardly any need for jailbreaking.\nThough the final call is yours.\n", "Q: Can I make an iPhone ring on cue without making an actual call? The theater company I work with is doing a show this fall in which a key plot point is an iPhone ringing while it's in someone's purse. They really want to make an iPhone ring and not just use a sound cue. But cell reception inside the theater is spotty at best. Is there some way to get an iPhone to ring without making a call to it?\n\nA: You can connect Your iPhone to WiFi (so that it has access to the internet) and ring via FaceTime. \nTo change FaceTime ringtone go to Preferences -> Notifications -> FaceTime.\n\nA: Two ways to simulate the effect of an iPhone ringing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a timer in the Clock app with the alert sound set to Marimba (the default iOS ringtone). However, this would require knowing exactly how long to wait before the sound plays.\n\n*Load an MP3 file of the default Marimba ringtone into the Music app and play it via a Bluetooth controller. Slightly more complex than the first option but allows more flexibility in the act.\n\n\nUnless there is something theatrically different between these options and an actual phone call to the iPhone, these are the only options I can think of without cell reception or wifi.\n", "Q: No menu items in Itunes's Account menu work.

It also shows authorise this computer, and de-authorise this computer at the same time. Clicking any of these have no effect whatsoever.\nWhen in the iTunes store, clicking on Account in the footer does nothing. When going through the Apple Music signup process in iTunes and click \"Already have an account\" does nothing. Any ideas what could be the issue here?\n\nA: Downloading and reinstalling iTunes fixed the issue.\n", "Q: Ghost-Imaging the BOOTCAMP partition for later restore? I have a MacBook and I plan to upgrade to Windows 10 but want to be able to roll-back to the original Windows 7 in case Windows 10 is not good for me.\nI have used Symantec Ghost to do a Hot-image (i.e. create image when Windows 7 is running instead of booting from a CD), I also imaged the \"System\" partitions.\nHowever, I still haven't gone ahead for the upgrade, as I am new in doing the ghost imaging, and I'm not confident that the image I created can restore the MacBook's Windows 7 to the original. Since it is running in Boot Camp I fear the imaging might have to be done different than ordinary Windows 7 installations. Also I'm not sure if the partitioning data (partition table, MBR, GPT, VBR, boot loader, or whatever it is), or any other vital data that I am not aware of, is really successfully preserved in the image I created.\nAm I on the right track?\n\nA: I would say you're not on the right track doing an update before you test if your backup works on Windows 7 to Windows 7 first. \nWithout knowing what version of OS X and Boot Camp, people might hesitate to report success or failure, but since Apple doesn't \"support\" Boot Camp you might check with Symantec to make sure you are able to use their support if you need it. \nAre you locked into Boot Camp? It seems you would benefit from having virtual machines you could snapshot and test and co-exist so you don't need to depend on a restore to bare metal scenario. \n", "Q: How can I get an iPhone through Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program on my family's Verizon plan? My current iPhone is on a two-year contract with Verizon that makes me eligible for an upgrade in January, with a plan that I share with my family. I'm really interested in Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program, so I was wondering, is it possible to get an iPhone through the iUP, keep my current number, and put the iPhone on my family's plan that has, until now, been all iPhones purchased through Verizon? If so, how would I do that?\n\nA: Yes, virtually any postpaid Verizon customer can sign up for the iPhone Upgrade Program through Apple's web site or in store. (So can Sprint and AT&T customers, although T-Mobile is currently in-store only.)\nThis is separate from any agreements you have with Verizon, and you will still have to finish paying off your current phone with them.\n", "Q: Is it mandatory to upload screenshots for all screensizes when submitting to the app Store? I am preparing a new application, and iOS requires screenshots of the application. They ask for screenshots in the following sizes:\n\nIs it necessary to upload screenshots for all resolutions?\nWhat will be the ramifications if I only upload screenshots for 5.5-Inch and iPad?\n\nA: From what I understand if you only upload 5.5inch and iPad, they'll just reject you outright. Currently, it looks like they require at least 4 and 3.5. If you indicate it's optimized for iPhone 6, it also requires a 4.7.\nIt looks like if it indicates that it runs on iPad you need both an iPad an iPad Pro. \nCheck out the requirements for yourself here: iTunes Connect Dev Guide\nRemember, required/requirements means it's mandatory.\n\nA: Now you only need to upload a 5.5-inch screenshot\n", "Q: Wacom tablet.

I disabled the SIP by using Terminal in Recovery Mode but I still cannot replace or edit the info.plist file. Optical drive is broken so that's not an option. Any advice appreciated!\n\nA: It is pointless to solve your problem. If you succeed in creating the USB Windows installer, you probably will not be able to boot from the installer on your Mac. You are suppose to use the optical (DVD) drive. \nThere are alternative methods to install Windows 7 on your Mac. For example, see the question: Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices.\n", "Q: iOS 6.1.3 delete update to iOS 9.3 I'm upgrading my mum's iPad from iOS 6.1.3 to 9.3 and it is coming up with a verification error.

All guides say to go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud usage > Manage storage\nhowever I just have: \nSettings > General > Usage\nand then a list of apps (none of which are iOS 9.3 or even add up the the total data usage) and below that settings for managing iCloud.\nSo my question is what is the procedure to delete the update on the ipad.\n\nA: I'm not totally sure what you're trying to do, but it sounds to me like you're trying to upgrade an iPad over-the-air. This should work, but transcending multiple operating system versions on your way up can cause problems. And could you be out of storage space?\nSince this method isn't working, you should try the other method (scroll down after opening that link), which is updating the iPad via iTunes. \n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the iPad into a Mac with iTunes installed.\n\n*Make the devices trust each other (accept trust if prompted)\n\n*Ensure the iPad is backed up to either iCloud or iTunes.\n\n*When the prompt is displayed on the Mac (\"Would you like to update the software on this iPad\") choose Download and Install to start the update.\n\n\nLet the iPad update, and you'll be good to go.\n", "Q: Can a thief know my Apple ID without my PIN code? I got my iPhone stolen recently with Activation Lock on. It's been off since it has been stolen according to iCloud.\nI received a phishing email attempting to get my iCloud password and I was wondering, so they have my Apple ID email address. Does that mean that they have access to my phone's data?\nWould it be possible for them to know my Apple ID even if the phone was locked and they didn't know the PIN?\nThanks.\n\nA: Without your PIN, the thief should not be able to get any data from the phone. The ID in the phishing mail probably is just a wild guess, I got a few of those as well over the years.\n", "Q: How to check the progress of files moved from one place to another in terminal? I am new to terminal. I started moving 30 gigs of data, from my desktop to my portable harddisk with the command mv location1 location2.\nThe problem is, I cannot see, how much data has been transferred. \nHow to see the progress in a bar format or in percentage format?\n\nA: I found this https://github.com/atdt/advcpmv it adds the -g option to cp and mv which will display a progress bar.\nHere's how I got it to work on El Captain:\nRequirements:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xcode\n\n*wget (you can install wget with brew or MacPorts)  \n\n\nThen:\nwget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.21.tar.xz\ntar xvJf coreutils-8.21.tar.xz\ncd coreutils-8.21/\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atdt/advcpmv/master/advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch\npatch -p1 -i advcpmv-0.5-8.21.patch\n./configure\nmake\n\nAt this point you will have cp and mv binaries in src/ give them a try and if you don't have problem with them you can move them to /usr/local/bin.\nYou may also rename the two binaries to cpgres and mvgres (or other unique names) so that you can use the standard cp/mv commands also.\n\nA: rsync can do that for you, with a nice progress meter that (as the man page says) \"gives a bored user something to watch\".\nrsync --progress --remove-source-files {source file} {destination}\n\nThere's a lot else that rsync can do, such as mirroring directories, recursing large trees, throttling bandwidth usage, and much more. man rsync is your friend.\nOh, and since you're moving a directory tree, be sure to include the --recursive option.\n\nA: The standard mv command doesn't offer an option to show progress.

When I turn it off, the browser redirect works and opens the page in the target app. When it private mode there is no pop for \"Open in app\".\n", "Q: Changing my Home icons Apple makes it rather hard to change things like the system font and icons for the home folder. And while I understand the problems that can occur when the system font is changed; is changing your icons (for Documents, Music, Home, etc) truly dangerous?\nMostly, I ask this question because El Capitan has made a normally simple process into something complex, annoying, and somewhat confusing. If changing my icons was truly harmless, why is it protected up System Integrity Protection [SIP]? \n\nA: Dangerous? No. But it could wind up being wasted time when you at some point you update your OS and the settings you made get reverted back to the system default; that depends on what icon you changed.\nOf course, we're not talking about a lot of time spent on changing an icon here, so I'd say go for it! I actually changed my Documents directory icon 8+ years ago, and it was still the same when I retired that MacBook earlier this year, after several OS upgrades. Some changes will stick longer than others!\n", "Q: Which application to replace Superputty / PuTTY CM in macOS Is there any application in macOS (MacBook Pro) which can work like SuperPuTTY / PuTTY CM does in Windows? I am looking for a free one.\nWhat I need is to organize my ssh sessions. I can ssh to my machines using terminal but they are individual windows and kind of hard to get IP addresses / names every time I need to connect to them.\nIt can also be an application which uses terminal application in Mac for ssh .. \n\nA: Look further into terminal before you give up on it. Under the Shell menu, you'll find New Remote Connection.... The list of default servers will be auto-populated via Bonjour, but you can still create and save new sessions for ssh, sftp, ftp, and telnet. Of course, the default services in UNIX also allow you to create your SSH keys so that when you log into a remote host, you don't have to enter your password.\nYou can also customize your windows with a lot of features not seen in simple Windows packages like PuTTY. Be sure to check out your Terminal > Preferences... for customizing colors, keyboards, shell commands, fonts, screen size, key mappings, terminal emulation, and a whole lot more.\nOh, you can also create new sessions in tabs, not just new windows; the second option under the Shell menu will do that.\n\nA: If you only need the tab features, terminal has an imbedded menu for it under Windows > merge all windows.

I then have to resize all of the windows to make them fit the Dell P2715Q monitor. Is there something I can do to eliminate that hassle? \nThanks!\n\nA: So for anyone that might have this issue, in my case it was as simple as rebooting into safe mode. \nI held down the shift key after the startup sound, released it when I saw the apple icon. After it successfully rebooted into safe mode I simply did a normal restart. I suppose this cleared out system caches and the windows stay put now after I wake up the displays. \n*One weird issue when booting into safe mode that might help others as well. For some reason I had an issue with only seeing a cursor and a black screen. I assumed for some reason the login window just didn't display properly and I hit Escape and typed in my password as usual. I then noticed a spinning beachball and it logged in.  \n", "Q: Archive Button in Outlook for Mac Not Showing on Ribbon According to the Outlook UserVoice site, the latest version of Outlook for Mac has an Archive feature.\nBased on this Microsoft article there supposed to be an Archive button next to the Delete button on the ribbon.\nI'm running Microsoft Outlook for Mac Version 15.24 and I'm not seeing the new button. I'm I running the right version? What do I need to do to make the Archive button show?\n\nA: As it turns out, the Archive button showed up when I added a Google account to Outlook for Mac. It did not show for the existing Exchange account. Guess the archive feature doesn't work with Exchange. \n", "Q: iMessage went from showing what time it was read to just delivered? I sent an iMessage and it showed it was read at 18.01. Few hours later it just says delivered and the message i sent before the last one shows the time it was read. Why did it go from read at 18.01 to just delivered? Have i been blocked by this person or what? \n\nA: I have seen this too on my own device. It is a bug, though it has persisted through several iOS 9 releases. (I think it started with 9.3 but I'm not positive on that.) It does not affect read receipt display on Messages for Mac.\nRead receipts are not retroactive, so even if you were blocked or the other person changed their read receipt setting, this would not occur. If you watch, when a future message is received, you will likely see that the last read receipt shown will move forward one message, to the message immediately before the latest message (in other words, the one where it is not displaying right now).\nYou can use the iPhone feedback tool to report this bug to Apple.\n\nA: If you -or your recipient- go to Settings > Messages you can disable \"Send Read Receipts\" which will have the effect described to the other party using iMessage.\n\nFrom an article on the subject:\n\nhowever it’s also important to note that this setting only applies to the current device. If you’re using iMessage across multiple devices — such as on a Mac and/or iPad — you’ll need to turn the setting OFF individually on each of your devices if you don’t want read receipts sent from those devices. Note that users will still see that messages have been “Delivered” — there’s no way to turn this one off\n\n", "Q: Found in diagnostics on an iPhone 6s Plus.

The font is weirdly pixelated at any resolution available except 1600x1200 which I got by doing the force RGB work around. Unfortunately at that resolution everything is stretched wide. While I can handle the ugly font right now with 1080p and some underscan (I switched the profile back from the forced RGB to the default), I was hoping there was a work around which allowed me to pick whatever resolution my heart desires (I know the option + click \"Scaled\" trick, the ones I'm looking for aren't available). \nSo is there a terminal command I can use to change the resolution on my external? If not, is there something else I can do? I'd like to at least try to see what the display looks like at say 1680x1050.\nThanks\n\nA: ENDS UP - the answer is to change the name of the HDMI input through the display's menu (the samsung menu from the external) to PC or DVI PC. \nAnswer from here: https://superuser.com/questions/146841/why-does-text-look-so-horrible-on-my-hd-monitor.

If time capsule can not be set up to log the web sites that users access, is there third-party software that will accomplish this for time capsule?  Ideally something that would work through the time capsule and not have to be installed on each individual device, but would allow analysis by device.\n\nA: The router itself does have DNS caching, but that cannot be accessed without rooting the device (and probably changing a few settings that shouldn't be changed to do logging to disk). Furthermore, an automatic update may reset everything, so I wouldn't go down that path at all. Much better idea would be to set up a DNS on a small linux machine and then configure the Airport DHCP to use your small Linux computer's DNS server as the default. That will persist through updates, etc. All clients connecting will ask the linux machine for the IP address of the website they want to go to. Just log it.\nAlso, for what it's worth, even if this is your network and these sorts of invasions of privacy are easy to do, I really really REALLY recommend you make everyone (children, etc) aware that this logging is going on.

I have a Mac. It is running Mac OS X 10.6.8. It is ten years old, came out in 2006.  I go to the App Store.  The listing for OS X 10.11 claims it is \"compatible with 10.6.8\", but when I \"get\" (click on the Get button) the update, it comes up with a message that says \"...cannot be installed on this computer.\"\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: Checking everymac none of the Macs listed is eligible to run 10.11 El Capitan.\nThe latest supported system for Xeon/Core 2 Duo processor equipped Macs from the year 2006 is 10.7.5 and 10.6.8 for Core Duo.\nBeing \"compatible with 10.6.8\" means that any Mac running 10.6.8 and supporting 10.11 can be upgraded directly.

You should get a dialog box asking if you wish to Restore or Update, and you should select Restore.\nYou can also log into icloud.com and force a remote wipe on your iPad.\nFor details, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306\n\nA: Try this:\nTurn on the iPad.\nNow hold both the home button and lock/power button.

Sometimes, the screen starts to display only lines (please see pictures attched for example). They change when I click around in the menu (buttons are still operational). They used to go away when connecting the iPod to my PC and iTunes, or when leaving the iPod in my drawer for days or weeks (I'm not that into music and I got this device in a raffle) - so this didn't seem to be a permanent fault. But now even that won't help. I tried resetting (pushing select and menu for 6 seconds) as well as restoring to factory settings. The line pattern changes and goes vertical when I shake or tap the iPod (I've read in some online forum that this might solve similar issues). I tried finding a similar issue online, but haven't found anything that looks similar.\nHow could I solve this issue permanently? Please reply with anything that will or might help - this is the first Apple device I own and I've no idea how to go about fixing these.\nKind regards,\nH.\n\n\n\n(Note: This is a cross-post from my post at Apple Support Community in the hope of finding a solution.)\n\nA: Eventually, Apple Community Specialists recommended that I contact Apple Support. They said this is definitely a display fault and it needs exchanging; however Apple only provides support for devices for about five years and they have no spare parts available as of today (2016), thus recommending me to source spare parts from vintage devices.\nUPDATE: I've purchased a replacement display from Hong Kong via eBay and implemented it following this guide: https://de.ifixit.com/Guide/iPod+Nano+2nd+Generation+Display+Replacement/421 (works, but new display has no backlight) - when attempting to slide the board back into the housing, it didn't fit - only after I widened the case with a spudger. Seems like it once had gotten crushed, causing an issue with the display connector. I've later re-implemented the original display - works as well.\n", "Q: How do I recharge my ipad's SIM card? I don't know how SIM cards work in your country, either you should charge (increasing its credit) it every time when its credit is finished Or its credit is unlimited .. anyway my SIM needs to be recharge after a while. Basically I do that like this via the mobile:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recharging: *141*{16 digit code}*1#\n\n*Seeing the current credit: *141*1#\nBased on this, that's depends on the sim provide.

While conversations on my other iPhone that were IMessages from same iPhone/sender/number/etc... DO show up. Any idea what would cause this? Would sending IMessages to the email/Apple ID address rather then the cell # accomplish this?\n\nA: iMessages don't go through your cell phone provider so they don't necessarily know about them.  iMessages go through your network connection so to your provider they look just like any other network/internet/browser traffic.  \nIf your text messages were from Apple device to Apple device (using iMessage for both sides), it's not going to show up on the provider logs.\nIf your text messages were from your iPhone (or other Apple device) to a non-apple device or an Apple device without a network connection but still connected to the cell network, that does go through your cell provider.  They will have a log of those messages.  You can tell which ones those are because the chat bubble on the Apple device is green instead of blue.\n", "Q: Dimming chase on Applescript I would like to create an automated brightness/dimming chase on my Mac OS Yosemite 10.10.5 using Applescript,\nI found this script>>\nDimmer: tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 107\n    end tell \nBrighter: tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 113\n    end tell\nWhat I would like to do now is to repeat that action and control the speed/timeframe of the dimming, \nAny Applescript expert able to help on that?\nThanks!!!\n\nA: Only because you asked... The code below is an example of using a repeat statement and delay commands with your code.\nThat said, I do not believe it is going to give you the desired results because while the events will trigger in code nonetheless they'll probably not be processed at the hardware level. (It doesn't on my system.)\nYou can change the numeric value in the repeat statement to suite your needs. The value is an integer, as in repeat integer [times].\nThe delay command shown in decimal seconds as in delay number being the number of seconds to delay.

The list is now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting the device\n\n*Five failed fingerprint recognition attempts\n\n*Receiving a remote lock command via Find My iPhone\n\n*Enrolling new fingerprints in Touch ID\n\n*Not having been unlocked in any fashion in 48 hours\n\n*NEW! When the iPhone or iPad hasn’t been unlocked with its passcode in the previous six days, and Touch ID hasn’t been used to unlock it within the last eight hours\n\n\nYou probably hit the brand new last condition without knowing it. I know you said your phone was charging for only 4 hours, but depending on how long it had been since you actually unlocked, it may still have happened.\nSource\n", "Q: iPad Pro 9.7'' power charging I read that the USB-C charger (29W) can \"power charge\" the large iPad Pro, almost reducing the charging time by a factor 2.\nWould the same work with the small iPad Pro?\n\nA: The charger works and can charge the 9.7\" iPad Pro. However, it won't do it any faster than the standard 12W charger.\nTo take advantage of the fast charging, you'll need the 12.9\" iPad Pro.\n", "Q: How do I take a screenshot of the keyboard viewer with modifiers (e.g. Alt Gr, Shift)? I am used to working on a US/CA English keyboard, but I'm currently based overseas and the keyboard that my workplace got for me has a completely different layout (ISO European). It's especially difficult for me to remember where the symbols are that are being modified by the Alt Gr and Shift keys, so I thought I'd make a screenshot of the OS X keyboard viewer. I know that I can take a picture of an application window with the Apple + Shift + 4 + Space Bar shortcut, but I can't seem to get the modifier key to \"stick\" so that I can take a screenshot of the keyboard layout with the modifier. How do I do this? \n\nA: You should be able to use Applications/Utilities/Grab.app for this kind of thing, it offers more kinds of capture including timed.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 15'' Retina Mid-2015: Upgrade RAM to 32Gb Is this possible?\nI read on the crucial.com website that it is not.\nI imagine 2x16Gb would be a bit expensive but not unheard of.\n\nA: It's not that the amount of RAM doesn't exist, it's that the upgradeability doesn't exist. The Retina MacBook Pro's RAM is soldered to the motherboard. Nothing is getting in or out.\n", "Q: Some PDF bills are printed out with empty squares replacing the text I have some bills from my electricity and gas provider and all the bills are printed out with squares being displayed instead of text. \nI already restored the Font Book to default fonts. \nI have no problems with viewing any of those bills on my computer.\nI have other PDFs and they are all printed out correctly.\nIf I open up the PDF which is printed out badly and export it to PDF within PREVIEW app, the output is same as on my printer. \nWhat else can I do to restore the normal printing? \n\n\n\nA: I have seen this issue before, and it appears to be a bug in Preview on 10.11.\nIt does something weird with specific TrueType fonts (including some previously supplied by Apple) that causes this effect.\nThe documents in question view perfectly fine, but when you try to save or print from Preview, it re-encodes them incorrectly in some way, resulting in the squares.\nThe same documents view, save and print fine in all 10 previous versions of OS X, and also work perfectly fine on every other platform.\nI've seen some suggestions that replacing / fixing your system fonts will fix it - however, that won't help in a lot of cases - particularly not with third party PDFs, since the fonts will be subsetted and embedded in the document.\nYour best option is to attempt to report it to Apple.\nIt's a real problem, because there's millions of PDFs out there already created that can't just change because Apple decides they're not going to fix their product.\nYou should also report it to your energy provider - their print supplier may be able to work around the issue by changing fonts or rendering the text as an image.\nOf course, that won't help the unknown number of future PDFs you may encounter with the problem, so definitely do report it to Apple.  The more people that report it, the more they'll come to see it's a problem that needs fixing.\n", "Q: Missing keyboard shortcut in El Capitan 10.11.5 to switch between windows within app I've just started running El Capitan (10.11.5) and one of my favorite keyboard shortcuts seems to have disappeared: the keyboard shortcut that let you move between windows within the same application. It used to be  Cmd ⌘   `   (tilde) but now that shortcut doesn't work and I can't figure out how to get it back. \nAny ideas? Thank you in advance.\n\nA: The Keyboard item in System Preferences has a Shortcuts tab. The Keyboard item in the Shortcuts tab has one item labeled Move focus to next window. The binding for that has a  `   rather than a  ~   (with the  Cmd ⌘  key; I don't know how to type a cloverleaf), but either binding has the same effect for me (that box is checked on my Mac).\nIt's possible you simply need to check that box; in any case, that seems like the first place to look.\n", "Q: Connection is invalid error when running Applescript and Safari The following applescript waits for a page to load before continuing with the do javascript \"document.body.innerText\" part of the script. It seems to work really well except for one thing. If Safari is running but no window is currently open, running this script results in\n\nerror \"Safari got an error: Connection is invalid.\" number -609\n\nYet if I run this when Safari is closed it launches Safari, goes to the specified URL and once the page loads, runs the javascript portion. I don't understand why it gets an error if Safari is running with no windows open.\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    activate\n    if not (exists document 1) then reopen\n    tell front document\n        set URL to \"http://example.com\"\n        repeat until length of (source as text) is not 0\n            delay 0.5\n        end repeat\n        do javascript \"document.body.innerText\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe error always highlights the source as text part of the script. I tried changing length of (source as text) is not 0 to repeat until name is \"example domain\" but the error still occurs if no windows are open and Safari is running. \n\nA: You need to swap the position of the activate line of code with the if not (exists document 1) then reopen line of code.\nExample:\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    if not (exists document 1) then reopen\n    activate\n    tell front document\n        set URL to \"http://example.com\"\n        repeat until length of (source as text) is not 0\n            delay 0.5\n        end repeat\n        do javascript \"document.body.innerText\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nThe screenshot of the Script Editor, below, was run with Safari open and without any windows opened.\n\nFirst I had to check \"[√] Show Develop menu in menu bar\" (Safari > Preferences… > Advanced) and then on the Develop menu click \"Allow JavaScript from Apple Events\". Next I copied and pasted your AppleScript code in Script Editor and clicked the Run the Script button and it ran without error and returned the text of the http://example.com web page. However Safari was closed when I ran the script the first time.\nAfter reading your question again, I was able to reproduce the error by having Safari open without any windows open.  I then looked more throughly at your code and noticed activate was before if not (exists document 1) then reopen and activate needs to be after it to avoid the error.\n\nA: Reseting my preferences file fixed this for me.

But I just noticed there are files in AllMyFiles dating back to 1997.  Are they \"borrowed\" from the iCloud?  Although they are not arranged in folders like in the iCloud, the ones I have opened are also  in iCloud.\n\nA: You can answer this question for yourself. In the All My Files view, right click one of the files and choose Get Info. The window which opens when you do that has a Where: field. For a file in iCloud, the Where: field says iCloud Drive.\n", "Q: Restore iPhone SMS history from Mac Messages without iPhone backup I recently reimaged my iPhone, however I forgot to check my SMS history before deleting my original backup. I assumed, incorrectly, that it would sync via iCloud, or by the SMS Forwarding feature that brings these messages into Mac OS X Messages. So, I have no sms.db, but I do have chat.db and the supporting Attachments. Extensive searching turns up nothing.\nHow hard is it to translate a chat.db file into an sms.db file suitable for restoring from an iPhone backup? Major surgery? Minor hacking? Rename the file?\n\nA: This will surely frustrate later arrivals who only have chat.db available, but I later realized I have other iOS devices with up-to-date Messages. I extracted sms.db and Attachments from those backups (using iPhone Backup Extractor), merged them into my latest iPhone backup (using iBackupBot), and restored the backup. I'd suggest turning on airplane mode to avoid receiving texts in the backup/restore interim.\nThis tutorial provides details on where these files go.\n", "Q: Spotlight search shortcuts to launch apps I want to be able to open Spotlight and launch specific apps without touching my mouse or scroll down through lists with the arrow key. For example, I want to press Command + Spacebar (to open Spotlight), then press \"ill\" followed by Return/Enter to launch Adobe Illustrator. This works sometimes, but other times this will open a document which has the title of \"I'll fly away.\" Similarly, I want the Spotlight search of \"PS\" to launch Adobe Photoshop, but it pulls up my \"hp psc 1300 series\" printer, instead. \nSpotlight does seem to have some sort of learning mechanism built in. For instance, I can now type \"in\" to launch InDesign, but, unfortunately, my brain doesn't remember that shortcut and would prefer \"id\" for InDesign. This is likely because \"Id\" are the initials used on the app icon for InDesign. This is similar to the \"Ps\" in my Photoshop example above. The learning mechanism doesn't seem to be able to learn the abbreviations I associate with apps, rather, it seems to learn that if I had been in the habit of typing an entire app title, it can predict that \"ph\" will likely become a search for \"photoshop.\" It seems to learn truncated portions of my search terms over time.\nI realize that this is not the primary purpose of Spotlight and that there are likely other apps/services in which this may be possible, but please refrain from focusing your answer on these points. \nSo, again, the question is; Is there a way to make Spotlight prioritize specific apps based on user-defined search terms/shortcuts, and, if yes, how?\n\nA: Navigate to the app then in the \"Get Info\" window, add your desired term to the \"Comments\" box.

So I'm opting for a different solution over debugging the AppleScript code.\nThis solution requires exporting the entire contents of the Contacts.app to a vCard file (.vcf), modifying it using a RegEx in sed, and then importing the modified vCard file (.vcf) back into Contacts. Note that this method will replace all existing contacts with the updated new allcontacts.vcf file and should not be an issue as it's really only removing the information you stated you wanted removed, just in a roundabout way.\nNOTE: These directions were tested under OS X 10.11.5 with the Contacts.app using its default preferences.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts.\n\n*Backup Contacts, click: File > Export > Contacts Archive…\nNow that Contacts have been backed up, do the following...\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the first contact and then press commandA to select all contacts.\n\n*Click: File > Export > Export vCard…\n\n*In the Save As dialog box it will show as, the name of the first contact and n others,  change it to: allcontacts\n\n*Copy and paste the following command into Terminal, then press the Space bar to add a space afterwards.\nsed -i.bak -E '/^TEL.*\\+48.*$/d'\n\n*From Finder, drag and drop the allcontacts.vcf file onto the Terminal window. Note that in Finder, the .vcf extension may be hidden and it will show in Terminal.\nExample: sed -i.bak -E '/^TEL.*\\+48.*$/d' /Users/me/Documents/allcontacts.vcf\n\n\n*\n\n*Now press enter to modify the allcontacts.vcf file. A backup of the original is created as: allcontacts.vcf.bak\nNow import the updated allcontacts.vcf file into Contacts.\n\n\n*\n\n*File > Import and select the allcontacts.vcf file, then click Open.\n\n*On the \"Are you sure you want to import n cards?\" sheet click: Review Duplicates…\n\n*On the ensuing sheet select Keep New and check the Apply to All checkbox then click Import.\nThe Contacts telephone entries containing numbers with a +48 prefix have been removed.\n\nThe target lines in the allcontacts.vcf file will have the following pattern and note the example below is not the only way it can present and thus the need to use a RegEx aside from the phone numbers themselves being different as the value for type= can vary too.\nExample line in the vCard file: TEL;type=CELL;type=VOICE:+48 697 107 394\nThe RegEx is: ^TEL.*\\+48.*$\nExplanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*^ assert position at start of the string.\n\n*TEL matches the characters TEL literally (case sensitive).\n\n*.* matches any character (except newline). Quantifier: * Between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed [greedy].\n\n*\\+ matches the character + literally.\n\n*48 matches the characters 48 literally.\n\n*.* matches any character (except newline). Quantifier: * Between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed [greedy].\n\n*$ assert position at end of the string.\n\n\nSo, the sed command, sed -i.bak -E '/^TEL.*\\+48.*$/d' file backups the file (-i.bak) and deletes any line starting with TEL that contains +48. Which based on how lines are stored in the vCard will just remove the lines needed to accomplish the task as lines starting with TEL that have +48 in them can only be the lines you want removed.\nNOTE: The also assumes you did not previously have any numbers with the +48 prefix before you updated your Contacts with the original vCard file that contained the numbers with the +48 prefix.\n", "Q: Filevault - Wordpress website issue I decided to try to turn on Filevault; the problem is I can NOT log into my Wordpress websites back end.\nIt keeps saying that my passwords are wrong.\nI go to another Mac that has Filevault turned OFF and try and I get in with no problems.

How do I cut off all of the dead space at the end of my recording? \n\nA: By saying cut off all of the dead space, I assume you wanna crop the track to remove silence at the end of the track? If I'm right, here is 1 solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the track to your iTunes\n\n*Right click on track and Get Info (or just cmd+i)\n\n*Select Options tab\n\n*Tick stop, and select time you want track to end and press ok\n\n*Go to iTunes Preferences: cmd+, (comma)\n\n*In General tab, click on Import Settings and select your output format, eg. MP3, then ok\n\n*Click on your song, go File > Convert > Create MP3/AAC version\n\n*When this is complete you can find this track by right clicking on it and say Show in Finder\n\n\nHope this is what you wanted?

I have five virtual machines set up for various versions of Windows (7, 8, and 10).\nFor some reason, my Windows 10 VM runs extremely slowly – it boots, but then everything grinds to a halt (the Mac overall, not just the VM). Often, the only way out is to force shutdown and reboot.\nThe VM itself is a completely clean copy straight from Microsoft (indeed, I can never get it to run fast enough to actually do anything with it). My four other VMs all run perfectly fine, obviously on the same hardware, and I have all five configured identically.\nI know that Parallels 11 advertises that it's ready for Windows 10, implying that previous versions aren't – but my Parallels 10 installation does list Windows 10 as an option in the VM configuration. So it would seem it's supported.\nIs there anything I can do to fix this, or is the solution just to upgrade to Parallels 11 (even though in theory my current setup should work)?\n\nA: I've had a better experience with Parallels 11 than I did with 10 so you might be worth considering an upgrade to improve the experienced. \n", "Q: Connecting two computers via audio cable This is sort of a weird question, but it occurred to me that it might be possible to connect two different computers via a 3.5mm audio jack cable, and stream sound between them simultaneously. \nIs this a dangerous thing to try? More interestingly, if I were to re-write some of the audio handling, would it be feasible to create a custom protocol to transfer data/files over this connection?\n\nA: Dangerous?\nNo.  \nStreaming sounds from one computer to another or simultaneously isn't going to damage your computer(s).  An input soruce is an input source.  It doesn't matter if it's an iPod, and iPhone, your stereo system or your old WalkMan.   Likewise, line/speaker output sends analog audio out.  If your output device is capable of playing it, you will get audio.  \nEfficient?\nI don't see how sending sounds via an analog port is an efficient way to transmit audio.  Transferring the file or using something like FFmpeg to stream audio to a network port is much more efficient as there is no digital-to-analog-back-to-digital conversion that needs to happen.\n", "Q: How to give Airplay traffic priority on network?

No heavy traffic is going to them (only some WhatsApp and browsing) \nDuring the download, data is coming in at around 6 MB/s, and I see that 200 KB/s is going up.\nWhen I check my Wi-Fi statistics I see I have a transmission rate of 145 (Mb/s I assume), which converts to 18 MB/s so I should have plenty of headroom.\nHow can I give Airplay priority on my network, such that there's always plenty of bandwidth available to stream?\n\nA: I don't know how to fix your issue but i can help you to go around it.\nSo if you have the wifi 5GHz (dual mode) you can put your playing device on that network and the downloading device on the 2.4GHz network. This somehow helped me to fix the dropouts while watching videos online.\nmy config is: iPad playing music via airplay audio, macbook Pro downloading a video. airport express with dual wifi.\nIt is not the final solution neither the solution you are looking for but it helps in some cases.\n", "Q: Do Macs Have Custom Models of Intel Processors? Do Apple Computers use the same-exact Intel processors available to PC builders or are they custom models made just for Apple? For example, if a Mac is marketed as having an Intel i7 3.3 GHz x-generation processor and there is a matching processor listed on Ark for that chipset \"generation,\" is it safe to assume that same-exact processor is in the Mac? Or does Apple get custom models within the chipset families just for their computers?\nAlso, is there a website where I can see the processor model numbers available in Macs so I don't have to spend time trying to match Apple's marketing to Intel's specs?\n\nA: They are identical. Don't know if we are allowed to talk about it, but all I can say is to search osx86project or tonymacx86, you will see the hardware.\nList of iMac and Macbook hardware and history.\nIf you search the Intel chips the Macs are using (eg. i7-4770HQ), you will see Windows laptops are using them as well.\nMactracker is an OSX App and an iOS App that has all the details from the first Mac to the last Mac.\n", "Q: Dynamically change the default browser?

Let's say there's a web page that can be scrolled through and within that page there's also a box that can be scrolled through. Currently, if I do one scroll on the mouse while the cursor is in the main page and then move the cursor into the smaller scrollable part of the page while the larger part is scrolling, the large part will stop scrolling and the smaller part will start scrolling.\nOr if I just start scrolling in the main part of the page, move the cursor to, say, the desktop, and then quickly cursor back to it, the scroll will start, stop when I leave, and then scroll a little more when I get back.\nHow can I stop this behavior? I'd like all scrolling to end as soon as I leave the element in which I started scrolling. It's annoying for work because I'll scroll, get to where I want, then move to another element, and then that element scrolls using the scroll I started elsewhere. This seems like a design flaw to me.\n\nA: Actually, this is not a thing you can fix on the operating system as technically you still are using the same window/part of a window which is a web view (in whatever browser you are using).\nThis can only be really fixed by the webpage itself by not making some elements scrollable. For example it's possible to deactivate scroll-zoom in some map providers widgets.\nI'm sorry to say that you may not be able to switch this off on an OS Level. Depending on the web browser you are using, there might be an extension that forces to turn scrolling off for some elements but that would most likely lead to partly unusable web pages if you ever need to scroll some of these elements.\n", "Q: How can I make my Apple TV 4th generation show up as a device in iTunes on my Mac?

I don't think you can use the internal storage on the Apple TV to store media in any way, it is just used to dynamically store data like apps and their downloaded or cached data.\n", "Q: Pricing an app in the App Store - is free followed by paid strategy allowed? Can we submit an iPhone app as a free app, then after a short period, change it to a paid app?\nThe guide indicates that the higher the intended price for an app, the more closely it is reviewed.\nWe want the app to be free for an initial introductory period, but will it look like we're trying to take advantage of a loophole?\nIf we can offer for free initially, then raise the price, do we have to wait for a minimum period before doing so?\n\nA: Yes, you can change the price of your app whenever you want for whatever you want.   However, the price change will affect everyone who 'buys' your app.\nThere are hundreds, maybe thousands, of apps that schedule price changes on a regular basis.  I know 1 app that does a free-to-.99 price change every 2 weeks.  Apple doesn't care but I'm pretty sure the app customers do care.\nEDIT: As asked in the comments, here's a clarification.  I'm referring to the price people pay for the app in the App Store.  For example, you make the app free for everyone in the App Store for 2 months.  You then decide to change the app price to $1.99.  That means everyone who downloads the app now has to pay $1.99.  If you got the app for free then you get all bug-fix updates to that app for free as long as the developer doesn't create a new SKU for the updates.  \nWe've all seen this happen recently when Tweetbot updated their app to a new version and created a new SKU for it.  To Apple, and your device, this is a different app.  If you paid for the first version you need to pay again for the update because the dev and Apple consider it a different app.\nIf you want to make the app free and then have an in-app purchase to upgrade and get additional features, that's acceptable.

What I want to achieve is that when the Mac boots, my session starts without me needing to type my user and password. \nI have created a daemon that launches at boot time and this daemon will call the script that will contain the commands I'm asking for (providing by default my user and password I assume). \nI can't configure my session to start automatically in System Preferences because if my script fails by any reason, then I need the login screen to ask for my credentials.\nIs this even possible to achieve?\n\nA: I found a solution to what I wanted so I'll post it just in case anyone is looking for something similar:\nAt boot time I launch a daemon that executes the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to key code 126'\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke return'\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"password_here\"'\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke return'\n\nIn the login screen the script selects the first user account with the up arrow (key code 126),  then an enter (keystroke return) brings the textfield to input the password and finally another enter to login.\nIF there's an error during the execution of the script, then you still have the login screen to authenticate the user.\n", "Q: kernel_task and mdworker use all available RAM memory I am using a MacBook Pro 13\" retina early 2015, running macOS 10.12 Sierra public beta 2. \nFor the last two days my computer is not usable since there is no available RAM memory to use, the OS is just freezing and after few minutes the computer restarts itself.  \nI checked the activity monitor to see what is the cause of that problem and I noticed that the kernel_task, the mds_stores, the mdworker and the mdworker32 tasks are using all of my RAM memory.\n\n\nTurns out that it doesn't matter if some program is running on my computer or not, it happens every time I turn on my computer.  \nI recently purchased a TarDisk for my Mac, a microSD card for expanding the computer's memory.\nThe problem mentioned above started right after the \"Pearing\" process.\nI understood that the mdworker task is a system software that takes care of Spotlight indexing. \nSince the \"pearing\" process of the TarDisk makes the OS to think the microSD card is part of the main Macintosh HD and since I have turned on FileVault again after the installation, I think Spotlight has difficulties indexing my SSD for some reason that has something to do with that.  \nIn order to solve this, I tried to fix any possible flaws in my SSD.\nSo I have booted into Single-User Mode and run the file system consistency check command fsck -fy until it said the volume appears to be OK. I also run the First Aid tool on the Disk Utility app.\n(Just to be clear, I have preformed those steps before installing the TarDisk, as the company instructed before beginning that installation process, but right now I am describing the steps I took in order to fix the problem mentioned above, after it appeared)\nIn addition, I have also restarted the System Management Controller (SMC) on my Mac, following the instructions on apple's site.\nNon of the above worked for me.\nI saw a way to disable Spotlight's indexing for the entire SSD, but I don't want to do that, since it will make Spotlight unusable for searching things and that is the entire point of this tool.  \nI would like to get any suggestions for solving this issue.\nWhat may cause it and what is a possible solution?\n\nA: First of all, kernel_task gets higher (if I not wrong) because of the mdworker.\nTalking now about the mdworker. Maybe the problem is not on your SSD at all. In this article recommends you to turn off Spotlight all devices. I recommend you to test instead with some folders of the SSD you might think Spotlight could get stuck in (large number of files, symlinks, ...). Also, you could try avoiding Spotlight accessing your external disks. Test until you get rid of the problem. Maybe you could find where the problem comes.\nAlso, you could try mdworker process always at 100%, even when not indexing this answer. Here founds that the problem resides in a Spotlight plugin. That could also be.\n\nA: TL;DR - I haven't found a precise solution, TarDisk installation process didn't go well for the first time due to some glitch, formatting the computer has done the work.\nI have contacted TarDisk's Support Team, as I suspected that the issue was due to the external drive I bought from them.\nThey suggested me to perform file system consistency check (FSCK) and System Management Controller (SMC) reset. As mentioned in my question, I had already done those steps and it didn't help me in solving my problem.\nTheir further step was to uninstall the drive and then reinstalling it because there is a possibility that the installation process didn't go well.  \nWhen uninstalling TarDisk, one has to delete the Logical Volume Group that was created and made the computer's SSD drive and TarDisk's drive be seen as one unified drive.\nI have decided not to perform a restoration from a TimeMechine backup, so I have deleted the entire drive and reinstalled the OS from scratch.  \nAs it turns out, both from my own experience and from the support team response, the problem was caused by a glitch in the installation process.\nThat glitched process did expand the storage on my computer but it caused Spotlight trouble in indexing the drive in its unified form (containing both the computer's SSD drive and TarDisk's drive).\nI also suspect that the indexing problem was caused because FileValt was turned on back again.  In that case, maybe there were files on the external drive and their encryption was stored on the internal drive due to a problem during the installation process. That made indexing my files almost impossible and caused the mdworker process to consume all available RAM memory.  \nAfter a clear start, I've installed my programs again, then I've installed TarDisk, and only then I've activated FileVault. In that case, the encryption was made after TarDisk was installed and indexing was made possible again.\nThat has solved my problem and right now I can use my computer as usual.\n", "Q: Will it work to turn off iCloud photos on 1 mac to allow pruning library on another mac I recently turned off iCloud in order to change Apple ID.  I turned it back on before the photos were deleted from my Mac #1.  Now it wants to reupload, but has to compare the photos to what is in the cloud.  I have a huge photos library of about 700GB.  I want to turn off iCloud for photos on Mac #1, let the photos be deleted from the mac, and then cull photos from the photos library on another mac which has iCloud turned on, before turning the cloud back on for the original mac.  My hope is to decrease the ultimate size of the library and I don't want to wait for it finish comparing the photos it thinks it needs to re-upload.  Is there any reason this won't work, or is a bad idea?  Thank you for any input.  \n\nA: It did eventually work.  Mac #1 finally realized that there was nothing to upload and started downloading from iCloud. Now both macs are in sync with the pruned library.  \n", "Q: I want to triple-boot Lion, El Capitan, and WIndows. Howto? I have a late-2011 MBP that currently has two operating systems on it. Those two operating systems were Windows 7 and Lion, for a long time. However, I have to use Yosemite (or newer) for some applications for work. So I blew out my Windows partition and set up Yosemite on it. \nNow, I want to install Windows again. However, 100% of the triple-boot tutorials I find assume that I want to install Linux as my third OS, so I can't just follow someone else's recipe. I recall Core Storage hassles when going back and forth between Yosemite and Win7. \nWhat's the best approach for me? I can't use Boot Camp, because I already have the Yosemite partition. Should I blow out Yosemite, repartition to have one full-disk Lion partition, use Boot Camp to install Windows, and then... something else?\n\nA: iPartition used to be the go-to tool for this kind of task, but it cannot handle Core Storage volumes, which makes it a bit limited these days.\nParagon have just brought out a new Hard Disk Manager which I have yet to try out for myself, but looks like it's the long-awaited successor to iPartition. Personally, I don't think the interface looks as good, but you can't have everything ;-)\nBoth apps require you to boot from an external device to work on the boot drive, of course. Paragon has a built-in boot drive creator, I can't remember whether iPartition does [it had a CD maker, back in the day, but I've not used it in quite a while]\nFor your particular scenario - I'd clone off one of the Mac partitions, re-partition as a single Mac volume [plus EFI/Recovery of course] then let Bootcamp do its regular setup. Afterwards, resize then add a new partition to clone your 2nd OS X back to.\n", "Q: How do I restart my iPad mini?

I need to have different footers for left and right pages in Apple Pages to make a sort of book layout in which the page number is close to the outer page. How is this achieved?\n\nA: Facing pages/mirrored pages is not possible in Apple Pages v5.x. The last version of Pages that supported facing/mirrored pages is v4.x (iWork '09). If you have access to a copy of Pages v4.x, v5 can save in that format so you can use the file in '09. Otherwise you would need to use an alternative product, such as Microsoft Office, that supports facing pages.\n\nA: Facing Pages has now been restored to Pages V8+ (not sure when it returned), but to access it you must be in a 'facing pages' view. If you normally work in single page view, you will NEVER see the option. \nSimply turn on facing pages,\nGo to document layout ->\n    Click Facing Pages. \nYour view will now be left and right pages.\nNow turn on headers and footers\nGo to Section -> click left and right pages are different\nThe bonus, here is that the inside and outside margins are also mirrored.\nYay - Thanks for returning this functionality\n", "Q: Where have my safari, App Store, iTunes Store, and Siri gone? I was trying to manage storage and deleting pictures to clear up space. I went back to my home screen and noticed something was different. Well it seems my Safari icon is gone. Also iTunes and my AppStore is nowhere to be found. It's been this way for two weeks and I've been tryin to search all through my phone to find em. When I go to settings I can't find any if them either. I thought about askin Siri to bring em up for me but she seems to be gone also!! And it comes up some voice control thing! Can anyone help?! How can I get them back? \n\nA: Sounds like your restrictions were turned on somehow. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings\n\n*Tap General\n\n*Scroll down to Restrictions and see if it says it's On\n\n*If it is, when you tap it, it will ask for a \"Restrictions Passcode\". If you don't remember setting this then just try your unlock code or SIM PIN.\n\n*You'll probably notice that the toggles for Safari and the others are set to off. If you don't want these restrictions in place then just tap \"Disable Restrictions\" at the top of that view.\n\n*You'll be asked to enter that passcode one last time to disable the restrictions\n\n\nAnd that's it! You should now be able to access everything again!\nIf you can't, there's another possibility that the device is being managed with a provisioning profile so if the above doesn't work, leave a comment and let me know. :)\n", "Q: How can I change Finder's \"Name\" column width in \"List\" view in El Capitan? My question is essentially the same as this question:\nAskDifferent.SE: How can I change the default width of Finder columns?\nBut I am concerned about \"List\" view, not \"Columns\" view.\nIs this customization possible in El Capitan? It is a nuisance to be required to manually extend the Name column width each and every time I open a given folder.\nI have tried holding down the option key while adjusting the Name column, but when I re-open the folder, the default Name column width has returned.\n\nThe root of Finder's peculiar behavior is explained here:\n\nFinders tries to expand List View to occupy full window width. The \"Name\" column is flexible so it stretches as needed. That is why Finder does not try to remember its width. It just occupies remaining space.\n\nIn other words, Finder will under no circumstance open a window with a scrollable horizontal bar; Finder will shorten the Name column—and exclusively the Name column—as necessary to ensure that all selected columns fit to the window.\nA sub-par workaround exists:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove all of the columns in \"List\" view except for the Name column (such as the Date Modified, Date Created, Size, and Kind columns) by right-clicking on any given column title and then left-clicking on the titles that feature a checkmark.\n\n*Once you only have the Name column remaining, close and re-open the window.\n\n*You will notice that the Name column has now expanded to fill the length of the Finder window.\nBut, two downsides exist for this workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your filenames are lengthy (as are mine), they will still be truncated to ensure that the window does not have a scrollable horizontal bar. This means that you have to double-click the Name divider anyway if you want to view the truncated material.\n\n*And, of course, if you want to view any file's metadata at a glance, you would have to either \"Get Info\" or re-add the columns to the Finder window.\n\nIdeally, I would like every folder's Name column to automatically adjust to accommodate the longest filename in that folder, so that no filename is cut off or abbreviated. I've created a separate question to address this desire. \nHowever, I understand that this particular functionality is wishful thinking. I would be happy to simply set the default width of the Name column manually one time per folder, and have that position recalled indefinitely.\n\nA: Actually, the solution in your linked question still works as of 10.11.6 - I think your issue is you are confusing Column View & List View... based on your stating '\"Name\" column', which column view doesn't have. \nFor List View, just drag the column header divider.\nTo make it default,  Cmd ⌘   J  & Click 'Use as Defaults'.\nI am uncertain as to whether that will override any existing ._DS_Store setting for other windows - you may need to clear them if you want to start afresh with your new defaults.\n", "Q: Sharemouse not working after switch to USB wireless mouse I recently changed from a wired Logitech Trackman Wheel to a wireless Logitech M570 Trackball (which has a USB receiver plugged into the USB port on an Apple wired keyboard) that is physically plugged into an early 2009 Mac Pro. I use Sharemouse v2.0.53 to virtually share the mouse and keyboard between the Pro and a 2012 Mac mini.\nSince changing mice, the mouse's scroll wheel no longer works on the \"remote\" mini (neither do the new thumb buttons, but I can live without those). Everything else with the keyboard and mouse still works. I tried installing the Logitech Control Center software on the mini, but since the USB receiver isn't actually plugged into that computer, it doesn't even recognize that a Logitech mouse is \"attached\" to it.\nI tried plugging the USB receiver directly into a USB port on the computer, instead of into the keyboard, but that didn't make any difference. Any ideas? Or alternatives to Sharemouse? (My \"free maintenance\" time is up and I would have to purchase another license to get an updated version, and I don't like that they want $50 instead of $20 just because I have three monitors.)\n\nA: After trying a bunch of tools to modify the scroll wheel's behavior, such as Karabiner and BetterTouchTool, with no change, I realized that the way Sharemouse controls the \"remote\" computer (mini) is through Accessibility, and so probably doesn't fire the normal events for those applications to catch and modify, therefore I'd probably need to adjust the events that were actually firing on the host computer before Sharemouse intercepted them and passed them to the remote computer. I did, however, figure out that the scroll wheel is working - it's just scrolling horizontally instead of vertically. (It's a two-way wheel that does not tilt side-to-side, so it should always be scrolling vertically.)\nI then tried installed Karabiner on the host Mac Pro and created a custom bit that got the scroll wheel going vertically on the mini, but it was like scrolling through molasses. Figuring I had nothing to lose, I tried uninstalling the Logitech Control Center software and after rebooting, scrolling was back to horizontal on the mini. I turned off the Karabiner setting I had created, and scrolling now correctly works vertically...except the thumb buttons do nothing, since LCC was handling the functions of those buttons. I'll have to play with Karabiner and see what I can get them to do, but at least scrolling works on the mini again.\n", "Q: Control-Command-Space opens Search When I use the  Cmd ⌘   Ctrl ⌃ \n Space  , It does not open the Emoji viewer, but opens a 'Search My Mac' in the Finder.\n\nA: You need to make sure that key combo hasn't been set up as a new command in System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Spotlight\nDefault should be  Cmd ⌘   Opt ⌥   Space  \n\nYou could also check it wasn't added as a specific menu command in App Shortcuts...\n\n...which would then show in the Finder's File menu too [together with a new 'Find By Name' item] compared to the original using  Cmd ⌘   F   \n \n", "Q: How does Time Machine works across upgrades? I have created my Time Machine backup in El Capitan (and updated the backup few hours later). Then I decided to enroll in Sierra Beta. At the moment I'm writing this, TM is backing up my content to my ubuntu server via AFP (in Sierra PB1). \nDoes Time Machine modify the backup by OS version on it's own or does it remove the old OS backup?\n\nA: Basically, an upgrade just makes a lot of the files that are included in a backup write a newer copy. There isn't any major change to the storage format and hasn't been since Time Machine was implemented.\nAll the changes have been in the code that runs the backup or changes to the rules about what files are excluded, but those changes revert when you install a clean OS before you go to restore files from any of the intervals stored in the backup.\nTime Machine backups are not bootable and they don't include all files - so you might not even end up restoring the files that change when you go from one OS update to the next.\nSpecifically - here are files that get excluded by rule:\n\n\n*\n\n*On OS X, what files are excluded by rule from a Time Machine backup?\nTime machine just backs up all files that aren't on a list to be skipped. It goes forward, time interval by time interval - writing any new files and updating any changed files. Assuming you aren't running low on space in the backup destination - you won't have any older files deleted from the backup and could restore files from before you made the upgrade.\n", "Q: How to upgrade SVN on OSX 10.11 El Capitan With SIP enabled I am trying to upgrade my SVN version on OSX 10.11 El Capitan. I installed the latest SVN version by brew install svn. When I am typing svn --version I am still getting the old version. From a lot of reading, I understand that I need to change the symbolic link form the old SVN to the new SVN that was installed with brew. This is made by deleting the old symbolic link with sudo rm /usr/bin/svn and then creating the new one by sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/svn /usr/lib/svn. the problem is that the new \"System Integrity Protection\" of the OS X El Capitan is blocking the accesses to /usr/bin directory. I found a simple way to disable the SIP but I am searching for a way to do this without disabling SIP. Is there a way to do this? What will be the best practice?\n\nA: Instead of changing a protected file, why not change your path so that the newer SVN is called by your scripts and users?\nThat's best practice since you don't control the OS but you control the environment. Second best would be disable SIP and overwrite the file you intend to, then re-enable SIP. The reason it's second best is it takes longer, needs you to learn SIP disable, and the next time Apple patches the tool, your work is undone.\nChanging path doesn't get undone when Apple updates the OS. This is the same even before SIP:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I upgrade git on Mac OS X?\n\n*Use downloaded Git instead of preinstalled Git\nJust replace git for svn in the examples above.\n", "Q: iOS continuous photo App I'm searching for an app (for my iPhone 5S) that takes photos (without stopping) every X seconds.

So my iCloud email told me I didn't have enough storage. I couldn't send or receive emails. Which I just realized I wasn't getting any new emails. I just added more gb. My question is will I never get those emails sent out during the time I didn't have enough storage? \n\nA: In general - it depends on how long you missed emails.\nA call to Apple Support would get you specific information about your account as well as an answer. You can also try sending yourself a message from another provider to see if you get a hard bounce error or if the message queues.\nWith iCloud - my experience is you get some leeway and Apple stores messages for a short amount of time (days to a week) for you to realize you are full and then clean up space. They block sending immediately so you notice the error condition and seek help.\n\nA: depends on your provider, but normally you get the \"not-collected\" emails later, with imap as well as pop.\n", "Q: Deleted /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin on OS X Guys yesterday i asked my brother to delete python 2.7 and install python 3.5 but rather than delete parts of python, he deleted all /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin.\nAt this point /usr/bin is empty and /usr/local/bin just has the python files that i downloaded today.

When your brother deletes everything in /usr/bin, he basically deletes most of the executable files that the Terminal and the system use. So the only way to get them back is to reinstall the OS. To do that, boot into recovery mode by holding cmd+r during startup, then after it boots up, select Reinstall OS X and follow the steps to reinstall OS X. It will not erase all of the files that you have. It only writes some system files (all the files in /usr/bin for example) back to where they belong.\n", "Q: iTunes Store Doesn't Recognize iTunes Library About two weeks ago, iTunes stopped recognizing my iTunes library.

I am working on an app that manages authentication keys, and I need to store them in hardware, because maximum security is absolutely essential. I did some research and only newer versions of Android actually integrate the KeyStore with hardware, but I can't find any source that clearly specifies the earliest version of iOS in which the KeyChain API or the like can be used to cache keys in the Secure Enclave.\n\nA: If you want to have the private key actually stored in the Secure Enclave you need to be running at least iOS 9 and you must generate the keypair using the SecKeyGeneratePair() function.\nThis means that the private key is stored in the Secure Enclave, while your app gets the public key.\nNote that this also means that:\nA) You cannot use a private key you have generated yourself in your own code, or retrieved from somewhere else (like one of your servers)\nB) You cannot retrieve the private key, so you must use the Secure Enclave functions for actually encrypting with the private key.\nIf your app requires you to do either of those, you can generate a keypair using the aforementioned function and use it to encrypt your own data (i.e. your self-generated private keys) with the public key from the Secure Enclave. Then you can ask the Secure Enclave to decrypt your keys when you need them. This is roughly similar to storing keys in Keychain.\n", "Q: Is it worth is to get a headset with AAC codec for iPhone?

During my search, I found that some of Bang & Olufsen headsets are supporting AAC codec, such as  H5 and H7.\nDoes it worth to get a headset with AAC codec considering that AAC is an Apple standard?\nIs there a noticeable difference between a headset that supports AAC codec and a one that doesn't?\nI'm an Apple Music user.\n\nA: It's hard to say whether it is worth it as it highly subjective.\nA headset with AAC codec support will be able to receive audio at a higher quality than the alternative SBC codec at similar bit rates.\nThe question is whether you are able to hear the difference in sound quality, and if that translates into enough value for you that you're willing to pay a premium for it.\nSo basically, if you're into high quality audio - go for the AAC support. If you don't care, you're probably not going to notice the difference between AAC and SBS anyway.\n", "Q: Is there an inverse command to open in the Terminal? By using open, I can open a file via terminal.\nFor example: \n$ open ~/Documents/notes.pdf\n\nopens the file notes.pdf in the Documents folder of my home directory. It shows up as a window. Now I'm wondering: \nIs there an opposite terminal command with which I can close the opened window (besides kill <pid>)?\n\nA: Use AppleScript via osascript\n osascript -e 'quit app \"Preview\"' \n\n", "Q: Cannot connect to OS X SMB server from Linux I set up an SMB server on my Mac by going to System Preferences > Settings > Sharing and enabling File Sharing. Afterwards, I tried to access it from my Arch Linux laptop. It asked for my password, as I expected, and I enter my Mac's login password. The dialog keeps showing however.\n\nUsing the terminal and entering smbclient -L 192.168.0.64 yeilds the following output on both my laptop connected to the network, as well as in an Arch Linux virtual machine running on my Mac:\n mike@ArchLinux > ~ > smbclient -L 192.168.0.64\nsmbclient: Can't load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it\nEnter mike's password: <I enter my Mac's login password here>\nsession setup failed: NT_STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE\n\nUsing PCManFM as my Linux file manager, going into network:/// shows \"Windows Network\". Going into there links me to smb:///, which then shows \"Failed to retrieve share list from server: No such file or directory\"\n\nA: I had this behaviour with my Mac Mini running MacOs 10.13 after activating File sharing, but NOT authorizing specific users. So my guess is that you simply forgot to enable login for your account.\n\n", "Q: How to see Contact Duplicates in Mac OS El Captian I am using the Mac OS Contacts app version 9.0 (latest).\nI only have the option to \"Look for duplicates...\" which will then allow an auto-merge option if it finds duplicate. What it doesn't do is show me which entries will be merged. \nOther Apple apps and the old contacts app allowed showing duplicates. This feature seems to have been removed in the last 3 (?) major Mac OS releases. Mac OS 10.6 had it.\nHow can I find out what will be merged before using the auto-merge option?\n\nA: I don't think there's a window to approve changes anymore (Contacts v9 on OS X 10.11), so you would need to parse a contact export or track the changes with a different tool than the contacts app. I just export the contacts database to a file on the desktop. Do the merge and see if it's what I wanted. \nIf not, restore from the backup or undo the merge.\nThe only thing to be aware of is checking whether you have zero, one or more than one cloud backed contact syncs - when the same contact is in two containers - the merging combines the data but preserves the each entry in each sync class.\nAlso, I make sure I'm connected to the internet when I make (potentially) large changes so that the contacts app can accurately feed my changes to the cloud sync.\n", "Q: How to change opera for mac's search engine for special dial page? I can change the address bar search engine but it doesn't effect the special dial search engine. I like to know where to find its setting.

Even if you change the browser's search engine, it does not affect that special box.\n", "Q: How to install OS onto a MacBook Pro with no OS installed I have MacBook Pro \"Core i7\" 2.3 17\" Early 2011 (Model: A1279). \nOut of ignorance I've delete the previous OS (Yosemite) to install Windows – I had some difficulties but i could do it.\nThe problem is that Windows couldn't detect my macbook drivers (video card , network card ...).\nAfter that I realized that there's a tool called Boot Camp Assistant that makes it possible to install Windows on a Mac.\nThe problem now is that I don't have any OS X on my machine. I've downloaded a couple of Yosemite DMG files and made a bootable disk using TransMac, but it didn't work.\nFirst dmg file: didn't detect the boot usb at all.\nSecond dmg File: no pass sign after booting from the USB in the loading phase .\nAny ideas how to install any OS onto my machine? \n\nA: EzOr, first read the note a the end of this document. \nThe procedure given below is for 2011 and older Macs with a working optical (DVD) drive.\nWhile it is possible to install Windows on your Mac without an other operating system, you would need to install the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" after installing Windows. In your case, it would be best to first start with the OS X that was originally shipped with your Mac, then install Windows. The steps are outlined below.\n\n\n*\n\n*To reinstall the version of OS X that was shipped with your Mac, you\nneed to boot using OS X Internet Recovery. Once booted, use the\nDisk Utility application to partition the internal drive with a\nsingle \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" partition using \"GUID Partition\nTable\" scheme. The reinstall OS X.\n\n*Once booted to OS X, use the Boot Camp Assistant application to\n\"Download the latest \"Windows support software form Apple\". This\nwill download the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" to a USB flash drive.\n\n*You will need a 64 bit Window installation DVD. If you have an iso\nfile, you will need to burn this to a DVD.\n\n*Enter the following command in a Terminal application window.\nsudo bless --device /dev/disk0 --setBoot --legacy \n\nThis will allow the Windows operating system to boot properly.\n\n*With the DVD inserted in the optical (DVD) drive and the \"Boot Camp\nSupport Software\" flash drive inserted in a USB port, restart the\nMac and hold down the option key. When the Startup\nManager displays the DVD icon with the label \"Windows\", select this\nicon to start installing Windows.\n\n*You will need to navigate to open a Command Prompt window. The\nprocedure varies depending on the version of Windows you are\ninstalling. (For Windows 7, see instructions given after these\nsteps) In this window, enter the following commands.\ndiskpart\nselect disk 0\nclean\nconvert mbr\nexit\nsetup\n\n\n*Install Windows. When finished, install the \"Boot Camp Support\nSoftware\" on the USB flash drive. This should complete the\ninstallation of windows.\n\n\nOpening a Command Prompt window using a Windows 7 installation DVD\nBoot from the Windows 7 DVD. Press the space bar, if prompted to \"Press any key to boot from CD or DVD.\"\nWhen the display below appears, click the \"Next\" button.\n\nWhen the display below appears, select \"Repair your computer\".\n\nWith the button \"Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows.\" selected, click the Next button.\n\nSelect the \"Command Prompt\" option.\n\n If you have already install Windows and need to install the \"Boot Camp Support Software\", this may help.\nHere I assume you have installed a 64 bit version of Windows. You can try downloading the \"Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621\". If you can not download this using your Mac, use a different computer.\nAfter installing the \"Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621, you will need to bless your Mac. Open the Control Panel and then open the Boot Camp icon. Select the Windows icon and then select the button to restart the Mac.\n", "Q: Have my Mac wake me up I am currently a thousand miles away from home and will be for 2 months more. Today, another bad thing appended on my Weekend, locking myself out of my mobile, since I wrote the PIN wrongly 3 times. However, tomorrow I will have to go to work, how am I going to wake up?!\nI went to Calendar and set up an event with a message with sound, but this does only make a very short sound and pops up a screen notification. These two are unlikely to wake me up.\nHow to tell my laptop to behave like an alarm clock?\n\nI am not worried at all for energy consumption at the moment and I have my laptop charging.\n\nA: Open the Mac App Store and search for \"Alarm Clock\". Take your pick from the many apps that will do the job.\n\nA: If you have a reliable internet connection, you can try this site, which has Countdown, Alarm and Stopwatch modes.\nMy brother uses this free (with in-app upgrades) OS X app available in the App Store.\n", "Q: Text on center of menu bar As shown in the picture below, within the highlighted green area, is there a way to put a text in the center of the menu bar? \n\n\nA: AnyBar with Text should do what you want. I have used the project it is forked from (AnyBar) to successfully monitor things.\nThis free app runs in the background and there are a variety of ways to issue it commands, including from the command line, AppleScript, or through programming languages like Go, Node, PHP, Ruby, Java, and Python.\nEdited to add: Note that the text won't be in the center of the menubar, per se, but it will be toward the \"inside\" of the status icons on the right hand side, towards the middle.\n", "Q: Is it safe to upgrade iPhone 5C to iOS 9? I want to do it before iOS 10 launches and it becomes impossible to use 9. But I'm skeptical given the low-config nature of 5C.\nAre there any known performance degradation in 5C if iOS is upgraded to 9 from 8? So far it is working good with 8 and I don't wanna ruin it. The usage is very basic, I have bought it for my Mom.\nAnd, is it really necessary to upgrade? I mean, is it possible that some apps might not work in future because I have not upgraded?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The iPhone 5C will run iOS 9 fine, as iOS 9 requires no greater hardware than iOS 8. My inferior iPod Touch 5th gen (comparable to an iPhone 4S, two years older than the 5C) became slow upon upgrading to iOS 8 but didn't get any slower when upgrading to iOS 9.\nAs always, do a backup before upgrading.\n", "Q: Three computers one Apple ID I have three Macs and one Apple ID.  If I remove a folder or individual photos from Photos on one computer, will it disappear on the others?  What's the best way to  manage this so each computer can be used independently?\n\nA: If you delete a photo from iCloud Photo Library, it prompts you whether you're OK with the picture being deleted from all of your devices.\nThe best way is to each person to have their own Apple ID. If all the three macs are your personal machines, disconnect two of them from iCloud Photo Library and switch on Photo Stream, that way the two machines will get the new photos and you can delete the ones you don't need.\n", "Q: iMessage Message not found My daughters iPhone (iOS 6) has been getting text messages from Unknown. There is no way to block this message. The content of the message is Message not found.\nMy carrier is AT&T. Is this a bot or an issue with AT&T? Is there a way to prevent these messages?\n\n\nA: A posting on the Apple Support Communities suggests: \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4356067?start=15&tstart=0\n\n\"You must contact your cellular service provider. This is not an Apple issue, that causes this. The reason, that the phone just started doing this: when you power cycle your phone, it clears the system cache files. Your network has text alerts, from your basic Voicemail, where someone used a service, called \"Cut-Through Paging\". CTP allows a person to leave a text message, with their callback number, instead of a voicemail. Visual Voicemail smartphones can not utilize the feature. Your provider may have to delete your old voicemail box, and then re-add a new basic Voicemail feature, to correct the problem. You will have to pwr cycle the phone, after the chane and setup a new VM box. CTP was designed to be used, with basic and messaging phones, that do not utilize Visual Voicemail.\"\n\nBut please note, this is from 2014.\nTwo questions to ask yourself would be:\nDoes this happen when you restart the phone?\n\nDoes this happen when using or accessing voicemail?\n\nAssemble as many details as you can about the event, including what may have triggered it. The same link above also has a comment indicating this happens on Windows Phones, too. It may be a carrier issue. I would recommend recontacting your carrier and ask them if the above scenario is plausible. \n", "Q: com.apple.xpc.launchd Report crash process constantly shows up with high CPU There is a process »Crash Report« in the Activity Monitor which uses 10-25% and constantly disappears and shows up again.

I tried to delete the app so I could reinstall it. However, nothing happens, and now it remains shaded grey and says 'waiting' at the bottom.\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Storage: Manage Storage\nScroll down until you find Facebook Messenger.

So once the MagSafe AC adapter is unplugged, the system goes down hard - zero power.  It loses system time every time I remove the AC power & reboot.\nSo, while I wait for a new battery to arrive, I would like to make the laptop at least hibernate before I unplug it.  So far, trying things like sudo pmset hibernatemode 25 standby 1 standbydelay 0 haven't made this work yet.  If I close the laptop or do pmset sleepnow, wait even a few hours and then unplug the AC & then reboot, the system is always starting afresh (no previous state to be restored, and loses system time).\nIs this because there is no low-power battery backup (the cause for losing system time), or because the system never went into hibernation?  Ie., would a system in hibernate mode, that then lose the system time due to absoluytely zero power, also lose it's hibertaion state?  (This doesn't make sense to me, as I'd expect the system to restore from the hard drive.)\nFYI, a hibernate file was indeed written, eg.:\n>>> ls -fal /var/vm/\n-rw------T   1 root  wheel  1073741824 Jul 31 18:31 sleepimage\n\nPerhaps losing system time causes the hibernate file to be skipped?\nThanks for suggestions.\nSystem Specs: MacBook Pro 13-inch late 2011, OS 10.11.6, SSD drive as primary, HDD in-place of DVD drive.  \n\nA: I've used the DeepSleep app for years to put a Late 2012 Mac Mini into hibernation.  After \"upgrading\" from OS X 10.11.5 to 10.11.6 two weeks ago, DeepSleep stopped working.  It would only put the computer into normal sleep mode, not hibernation.  I spent a few days communicating with the author of DeepSleep and none of his suggestions fixed it, so I reverted the system to 10.11.5 using Time Machine restore and DeepSleep again works.  So your problem may simply be that you're running 10.11.6.\nI have also tried sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 on the command line, as well as sudo pmset -a standby 0 and sudo pmset -a standbydelay 0.  None of those have ever made my Mac Mini hibernate when the power button is pressed, even if left overnight, and even on earlier OS X versions.  However, those commands are supposed to work on laptops.  Since you say they don't, that's more evidence that Apple completely broke hibernation in 10.11.6.  However, someone here says they got pmset options to work only after resetting SMC and NVRAM so maybe give that a try.\n", "Q: How do I forcibly unpair my Magic Keyboard from my Mac, so that I can pair it with my iPad? I have a Mac, and a Magic Keyboard paired with it.\nI now want to use the keyboard with my iPad. To do so, I first need to unpair it from the Mac.\nBut what if the Mac isn't with me right now? Is there a way to force the Magic Keyboard to unpair itself from whatever device it's currently paired with, perhaps by pressing some key combination?\nSome articles say to hold the power button down for three seconds, but the keyboard doesn't have a power button to hold down.\nPS: The reverse direction is easy — getting a Magic Keyboard that is paired with an iPad to pair with a Mac. Just plug it in to the Mac, and it will pair. This question is about the opposite: the keyboard is already paired with my Mac. How do I force it to unpair itself from the Mac?\n\nA: Fixed, I had to remove the wired USB keyboard i had plugged in, and I also held the power button down on the magic keyboard while bluetooth searching for it.\nThe response on this forum dated Dec 24, 2010 2:29 PM helped me:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2693201?start=0 \n\nA: No - the pairing record on the Mac will remain until you remove it from that Mac. It's a sleeping dog situation when the Mac isn't nearby.\nYou can get a factory wipe of Apple's Bluetooth keyboards using this debug feature in macOS: - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/15291/5472\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold shift and option (only) when clicking on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar of the Mac\n\n*Select Factory Reset for each device you wish to reset\n\n\nA: if the Mac it is paired to is out of Bluetooth range your keyboard will have no problems pairing with your iPad(providing the batteries are good). If it is still in range simply turn off the Bluetooth on the Mac temporarily until it connects to your iPad. If like me you store your iPad turned off(fully charged is best) then your keyboard will reconnect automatically to the Mac as soon as it has BT turned on and the iPad is turned off(or just disable iPad Bluetooth to give it back to the Mac whilst both are on) Your Bluetooth device can be paired to multiple devices....it can however only connect to one at a time. Keep the \"Show Bluetooth in menu bar\" option ticked in preferences to make this a simple option.\n", "Q: Dark theme for El Capitan? How can I enable dark theme of GUI? I can not believe that it is not possible. As I googled - theming was possible at the past but now for security reasons I need look to the bright screen at night.\nQuote from flavours.interacto.net:\nApple introduced a new security policy on OS X El Capitan, preventing every process (even privileged ones) from modifying system files, either on filesystem or dynamically at runtime.\nNo workaround?\n\nA: I can suggest the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*You could use the Freeware 'XtraFinder' (http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder). There is a workaround for OSX 10.11 to enable and it works great. I use it for File- and Folder Colors/Labels, a feature i missed very much and now i got it back ;-) \nThe function you are looking for is \"bright Text on dark background\" for which you can define the colors to your liking for the window content. You cannot change the color of the window Frame, Title and Tabs, though.\n\n*You could use the commercial 'Pathfinder' (http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/). It's often promoted as a Finder-Replacement and has tons of useful functions. One of them is hidden in the Preferences - the \"Appearance\"-Settings. Here you can configure nearly all display elements of PF. They offer a 30 Day Trial.\n\n\nI hope one of these help you solve your Problem. \n", "Q: iTunes 12.4.1 cannot sync music to my iPad I have tried syncing mp3 files I downloaded from a youtube converter (youtube-mp3.org), imported them to iTunes and then tried unsucessfully to sync them. My school has requested that I download a certain list of apps to use at school, i don't have an Apple ID so my dad synced the apps using his computer. Problem is that my iPad only syncs to his computer ever since he synced the apps. Are there any FREE solutions to fix this?\n\nA: First of all, you had better create a free Apple ID. \nI think iFunBox is what you need. A tool for iOS management from Mac/PC(without syncing iTunes and using an Apple ID). iExplorer is another app that is a little bit easier to use.\n\nA: I simply enabled \"Manually manage Music and Videos\" in iTunes and then dragged the music to my iPad via \"On my Device\" in iTunes.\n", "Q: Persistent vertical blue line (Macbook pro 13 mid 2010) Can anyone help me understand what this is?

Similar happened on one of my devices recently.\nOnly fix is to replace the screen.\n\nA: Most likely it's the LVDS cable.  You'll need to take it in for service.\n", "Q: What will happen to our Mac if using higher RAM than Apple \"allows\" it? I am thinking to upgrade my RAM to be 16GB. However Apple states up to 8GB only.\nAnyone has experience upgraded RAM more than Apple allows?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro (Early 2011) support up to 16 GB of RAM just fine. Apple stated 8 GB of RAM as maximum when the model was released, but it has later been confirmed that it actually support 16 GB of RAM without problems. For example check this link:\nMacBook Pro Early 2011 - EveryMac\nThe Mid 2010 and Mid 2012 Mac Pro's support at least 48 GB of RAM.\nSo all in all, there should be no problems in upgrading to 16 GB of RAM if you have one of these Mac models.\n", "Q: pgp on macOS 10.12, Sierra Rrunning macOS 10.12, Sierra, on my secondary Mac and am fairly happy with stability and all that.\nNonetheless the one thing bugging me to the max is the incompatibility of GPGTools.

I was not able to find this answer in the license agreement of Pages, and Keynote, or may be i missed it since i am not a lawyer. Are these default content opensource?\n\nA: Almost certainly not.\nWhat pages license are you looking at? Section D starts on page 1: You may not and you agree not to ... create derivative works of the Apple Software or any services provided by the Apple Software. \nI would recommend you focus on finding images that are unequivocally granted under creative commons license and perhaps getting a lawyer or at least pay someone to guide you on keeping records of how you source your app and web images.\nJust like taxes and accounting - we aren't all accountants, but we need to know when to employ them and the same goes with lawyers.\n", "Q: Where is `defaults -currentHost write domain key value` written to?

It is consistent between system startups, so it must be somewhere on the disk...\n\nA: If you use -currentHost with defaults it acts on .plist files in:\n$HOME/Library/Preferences/ByHost/\n\nAs an example, I did not have a com.apple.finder plist file at that location and when I executed the following command, one was created at that location.\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.finder GoToField \"/foobar\"\n\n\n$ defaults -currentHost read com.apple.finder GoToField\n/foobar\n$\n\n\nNote the full file name contains a UUID however you do not need to include it when -currentHost is used, the normal naming is all that's needed as shown in the command line above.\nExample: $HOME/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.finder.6966D045-28DC-544A-97C2-98CDB668DC8B.plist\n", "Q: Mulitiple wifi connections on Macbook I have an external, long range, wifi antenna that I use for picking up internet and I also have a wireless nmea network on my boat for my marine instruments.  The problem that I am experiencing is that I must disconnect from my nmea network in order to get anywhere on the internet because when I have both wifi nets active, the Macbook Pro wants to use the nmea network to connect to the internet and it can't.  It doesn't matter which way I connect [internet on airport/nmea on external, or the other way around] the internet is inaccessible when the nmea net is active.\nCan I make it so that the internet will only come through the external antenna and the nmea net will only come through airport?\nThanks for any help \n\nA: If the external wifi device shows up in system preferences network pane, ensure that the internal adapter is above it in the \"set service order\" dialog (get to this by clicking the gear icon near the bottom left corner and selecting \"set service order\")\nDo note that some external wifi devices do not show up in system preferences or don't obey this setting, so YMMV. If it doesn't show up or doesn't obey the service order, your only option would probably be to change it manually in Terminal.\nNote that if you don't have a valid IP address on one of them it will automatically be lower than one that does.\nAlso, if the two networks also share the same IP scheme (ex 192.168.1.xxx), the computer might be getting confused by this. The way you describe this makes me think this is the problem, but service order is also a distinct possibility.\n", "Q: Turn off the SSH Agent How do I turn the SSH Agent off?

As long as you share the same iCloud account with your kids, or anyone, they'll be able to view and edit your documents.\nYou didn't mention the ages of your kids, but Apple allows you to create iCloud accounts for minors so you can have parental controls over various aspects of their accounts.  FWW, I had the same problem and created accounts for my kids and wife.  Doing that solved the problem for me.\n\nA: I'd highly recommend, not only separate AppleIDs for each family member, but also Family Sharing \nOne account becomes the Family Organiser, any others can be set up as adult or child, with parental controls.

Chrome does not outwardly expose the chrome:// and chrome-extension:// URL schemes, handling them internally (when you access chrome://history, chrome://settings, etc.). \nFor example, open chrome:// does not work in Terminal:\n\nThe file /Users/user/chrome: does not exist.\n\nYet, typing open twitter:// in Terminal causes the Mac Twitter app to open on my machine.\n\nHowever, you can use a bash alias to achieve a similar effect, with an even easier shortcut:\nalias chrome_ssh=\"chrome-extension://pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/html/nassh.html /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome\"\n\nAdd the above to your ~/.bash_profile.\n", "Q: IOS 9.3.3 - 9.3.4, no dictionaries I recently updated my iPad Pro to iOS 9.3.3 and noticed that my dictionary always gives the message \"No definition found\".\nThis might have started earlier and I just didn't notice until now.\nI tried selecting Manage from the bottom left of the empty dictionary message, however, I still get the same message and no dictionaries to add.\nI already tried to restore my iPad with no success.\nNow I updated it to 9.3.4 and the dictionary problem isn't fixed.\n\nA: I had the same issue, to fix it go to this directory in your device: /var/MobileAsset/Assets. \nThere is a folder (com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionary2).

I tried to use Disk Utility in recover mode many times but it would fail either to erase or mount the SSD, even though it recognized that the SSD was plugged in. I thought it was the faulty SSD. \nThen I hooked up the SSD using USB and proceeded to install OS X on it (using my HDD). The SSD functioned very well using the USB, so I put it in, and hooked up using the flex cable that was previously used for my HDD. However, it doesn't function, the OS sees that there is a drive hooked up, sees the name, size and etc, but won't load, gives me the question mark folder sign, when I try to verify or repair the disk, it fails to do so. \nSo I think it is something with the SATA cable. But the cable functions perfectly when used with the HDD. So I was wondering if the HDD cable that comes with MacBook Pro Mid-2012 is compatible with SSD. I have watched several videos of people upgrade from HDD to SSD, but they all seem to be using the same cable. Any ideas what might be the issue or if I need a different kind of cable?\nEDIT: The issue has been solved. As people have suggested here, it was just a faulty cable, or just the original cables don't work with SSD. I bought the same cable, 821-1480-A from a vendor on Amazon and it works quite well with SSD for now. Thanks everyone for your help. \n\nA: I have read where the logic board is capable of working with SATA III drives which allows for the installation of either a HDD or SSD. When a Mac is sold with a HDD, usually this is a SATA II drive. Therefore, the cable used is designed for this type of drive. The cable can not be used with SATA III drives. When sold with a SSD, this is a SATA III drive. In this case, the cable used is designed for a either a SATA II or SATA III drive. \n\nThe end result is that if you started with a HDD, then a upgrading to a SSD may require a different cable.\n\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2015 fan at 7000rpm I have a brand new Macbook Air and since first start fan is pretty loud.\nI've tried SMC restart but that didn't helped.\nNow I have installed SMC FAN CONTROL and it's showing that fan speed is currently 6945rpm after the restart, and before it was at 7065rmp.\nAnd fan is pretty loud since I press power button on.\nAny idea how to fix it and is it even possible to be 7000rpm?\n\nA: The difference between 6945rpm & 7065rmp might just be the noise in the measurement - these are both basically saying \"7000 rpm\".\nPerhaps one of the thermal sensors isn't attached/set properly (although this would be unusual for a brand new computer), so it always runs at maximum fan speed just to be safe (which might be nominally 7000rpm in your case).\nSince it's brand new I'd take it back and ask the Apple Store to check it.  \n\nUpdate:\nI found out after years that DropBox (along with some other progs) would caused my fans to blaze. \nPerhaps because I was syncing a massive work DBox drive, it was always computing at max power. \nI quit DropBox and the fans start to slow down to a reasonable level. Quitting would DropBox drop the CPU temp and fan speed within ~15-30 sec, although quitting other programs (such as MS Office apps, NetFlix in a browser window) sometimes had some effect if DropBox was already closed.  Since I wanted DBox syncing on, and this indicated that the fans were just blazing due to actual CPU usage (not some hardware problem), I would just learn to live with it (or quit DBox when I wanted a quieter computer).\n\nA: Since you mentioned you tried SMC Restart, I would also try resetting your PRAM:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Turn your computer off\n  \n*Turn it back on and wait until you hear the startup sound\n  \n*Press and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound.\n  \n*Hold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time.\n  \n\nThe timing of the key presses (after the chime but before the computer starts) can be a bit tricky - if you don't hear the chime a second time, it did not work. It usually takes me a couple tries.\nI had an older (~2012) Macbook Pro that had the fans constantly running at full blast a couple years back, and that fixed it for me. Your issue may not be the same, but maybe it can be helpful.\nIt's unusual to see fans running at 7000 RPM, on my computer they max out at 6000 (possibly because of model differences). For comparison, my current Macbook Pro runs with the fans between 2000-3000 RPM almost all the time, according to SMC Fan Control. The only times it hits 6000 is doing intensive work, like rendering a video.\n\nA: I tried all your solutions, and bunch others I found on internet. Nothing helped so I'm taking macbook for official service. Guess it's something mechanical.\n", "Q: Two-part AppleScript key sequence?

I want to use Google/Android emoji (noto font) instead of the standard apple emoji set. Can I do that on mac? \nsudo cp Downloads/NotoColorEmoji-unhinted/NotoColorEmoji.ttf /library/fonts/Apple\\ Color\\ Emoji.ttf doesn't change anything and SIP prevents changes to /System/Library/Fonts/Apple Color Emoji.ttf\nI'm running 10.11.6 on a 5k iMac if it makes a difference\n\nA: Yes, you can!\n--EDIT--\nThe below still works, BUT, turns out, JoyPixels (close Google emoji / Noto Font) has an emoji set including a .ttc file directly for download on their website for free that you can simply download and install as a font: https://joypixels.com/download\nFonts are in a .ttf file format, but Apple compiles those files using a SBIX format and others use other methods, typically CBDT/CBLC is used. Because of this, even though you have a .ttf file, it has to be compiled in the SBIX format. There is a user (vXBaKeRXv) on Github who has compiled multiple emoji fonts using the SBIX format. There's a Github thread and a Medium article on what to do. Quoting from the Medium article:\n\nThe Step-by-Step\n\n*\n\n*Head over to this Github repo and download the .deb archive that contains your emoji set of choice.\n\n*Extract/open the .deb archive. Once inside, extract the archive named data.tar.gz. You’ll now see a folder called var. Inside that is a folder called mobile. Keep on going deeper and you’ll eventually reach your destination: a font file named AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf.\n\n*Rename AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf by putting spaces between each word and removing the ending, so that the new file name is Apple Color Emoji.ttf.\n\n*Keeping that Finder window open, start up Font Book (the built-in app where you can manage all the fonts installed on your device). In the left side panel at the top, select the ‘Computer’ option to show all the fonts you’ve installed as well as the default system fonts. If you scroll down the list of fonts, you should see an entry called Apple Color Emoji close to the bottom. This is the font file you’ll be overwriting, but don’t worry, this process is easily reversible!\n\n*Drag the Apple Color Emoji.ttf from the Finder window into Font Book. You’ll be prompted to install the font. It may warn you about it being a duplicate, but we already know that, so keep on going. Once you finish installing the new emoji font, you’re good to go! Try out your new emoji set by opening up your browser of choice, selecting a text field, and press CTRL+CMD+SPACEBAR to quickly bring up the emoji picker.\n\n\nFor step 2, this works on a Mac to unpack a .deb file without installing it:\nar -x path/to/deb/file.deb\n\nA: Yes and no. You can change the default emoji font used by Mac OS X, but I don't think you can change it to Google's Noto fonts, although that may depend on your version of OS X.\nBasically if you have a font file in .ttf format that contains emoji, you can replace Apple's emoji font with that font using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ignore the default location for Apple's emoji located in system/library/fonts. In other words, leave this alone.\n\n*Obtain another emoji font file. HINT: The emojione font is similar to Google's.\n\n*Rename your other emoji ttf font file to Apple Color Emoji.ttf\n\n*Move the newly renamed font file to the /library/fonts folder. \n\n\nI know the above process works for El Capitan, but your situation may be different.\n\nA: No, you can't.\nApple uses different type of ColorEmoji font, SBIX if I'm not mistaken, Google uses another different CBDT/CBLC format, so they are incompatible for each other.\nIf you want to use Google's NotoColorEmoji, you need to decompile ttf file, and recompile it as Apple compatible version.\n", "Q: Freezing after update to iOS 9.3.3 I just updated my iPad to iOS 9.3.3 this morning and immediately have been having problems with glitching and freezing.  Hard restart will usually work but then within 2 minutes of using it, it freezes again.\nIs there a way to fix this problem?  Either with another update or within my 9.3.3 update itself?\n\nA: Try some basic steps:\nFirst of all backup all data of your iPad and restore the iPad from the backup. If it still happens, restore the iPad to factory settings.\nIf that doesn't work, try downgrading to 9.3.2 (you can still do it) by downloading the IPSW file from ipsw.me and download the iOS 9.3.2 IPSW file for your iPad model.\nIf problem continues, you may have to take it to the Apple Store and let them service your iPad because it might be a hardware issue.\n", "Q: Second partition to keep data safe? I am new to Mac and I don't know very much about the operating system. I am used to Windows where I had a C partition for the OS and other partitions for data.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my photos and videos so please advice me.\n\nA: It is rare to need to reformat the operating system only part of your Mac.\nRecommended: Use one partition\nI believe the overwhelming majority of Mac users have a single partition on their internal drive. This lone partition is used to store everything: operating system, applications, and documents.\nThe UNIX-like file layout does a good job of keeping all these files organised and separate. With OS X 10.11, new security measures have further isolated the core system files from your own files.\nBack Up and Use Time Machine\nIn order to avoid loosing photos and documents, attach an external drive and turn on Time Machine for that drive. Time Machine is macOS's built-in back up mechanism. This will protect you from most problems.\nIn the worst case, you can wipe your Mac's drive, re-install macOS, and restore your documents with Time Machine.\nUpgrades and Recovery\nUpgrades of macOS only update the operating system part itself, leaving both your data and user-installed applications untouched. The same applies for reinstallation of macOS which can be done from the Recovery Partition without touching your data.\nOptional: Isolating your documents\nAs a developer, I do separate my operating system and applications from my user documents.

Therefore, you want to start at \"character 3.\" I have made the correction here.\nDo it this way:\nset the_short_name to characters 3 thru -2 of the_original_name as string\n\nThat's all there is to it.\nSince you're working with Hazel you can get the name of the file this way:\nset the_original_name to name of theFile\n\nYou may want to pull off more than just two characters since the last four characters are probably \".png\" so take off 6 characters, and then add \".png\" to the short name. \nOne more thing: Hazel may think that the renamed file is a \"new\" file, and consequently run the AppleScript on the renamed file over and over until the name is so short it can't get shorter. The way I'd handle that is I'd move the file out of the watched folder first, and rename it after that. In my case I have a folder called \"Renamed Screenshots\" on my desktop-- your path is going to be different.

I understand this precaution is made by Apple against malware. However I still want to install Panda3d, how can I be sure it isn't a malware or has malware in it? \n\nA: Checking for malware is a complex thing. Something that might be a dangerous operation for a program to make (like deleting the entire contents of your hard drive), might be an unintended action (making the program malware), or it might be a feature of the program and exactly what you meant to do.\nThe way OS X generally decides if something is \"unsafe\" is by checking for a code signing certificate. Code signing certificates themselves don't guarantee that a program isn't malware. What they do is provide traceability back to the original developer that build the program, and verifies their identity through third parties. This is generally the same process used for certificate validation on websites.\nThat said, OS X still doesn't know if this is malware or not. It just knows that it can verify the program was built by someone who has verified their identity with a third party. Not have that verification only means the person who built it didn't have a certificate. It might still be someone you trust but the system can't tell.\nMalware detection systems generally check code for copies of malicious code fragments that have been identified before. They will often also check to see if the code will do something it knows is dangerous (like deleting your entire hard drive, or accessing files it knows it shouldn't), but these things are still difficult to define.\nThe easiest way to avoid running malicious code is to use a virus scanner (I personally don't have one to suggest for OS X), but the best way is to do your own due diligence and only run code that comes from a trusted source. Be thorough about reading the address of any links you download software from and make sure they point the the website you think it should. Sometimes a software distributor will publish a hash (MD5 or SHA1/SHA2) of the file, which you can use the verify that the file you've downloaded is an exact match to that which was published.\nIn most cases, you will need to assess how much effort you need to take to verify that code is safe, which usually depends on how much is on the line. Are you running this code on your personal computer, or a hospital computer with patient records on it? Is this a computer you use for fun, or is the operating a nuclear power plant? These are things to consider when deciding how much effort you're willing to go to in order to stay safe from malware.\n", "Q: How Can I Create A Service To Alphabetize A Comma Separated Text String? My understanding is that RegEx will not do this. What will? \nMy issue, specifically, is extremely messy iTunes genre tags. I would like to merge genre tags that have the same or similar comma separated values, and to merge those values in alphabetical order.

How to fix that? I have MacBook Pro (Late 2013) and a router, that serves two wireless network (2.4GHz and 5GHz) with different names. Most of my devices are connected to 2.4GHz network, while some are connected to 5GHz network. I'm running on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\nAfter MacBook goes to sleep or gets rebooted it couldn't find ANY of my networks, while it could see a number of neighbour's networks. After some time it suddenly finds both of them and connects to 5GHz.\nI've tried everything, removed network configuration from /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/, created new location, turned wifi on and off, you name it. Nothing works, as soon as it goes to sleep it looses my networks.\nMy other devices could see both my networks perfectly at all times.\nScan utility from Wireless Diagnostic is unable to detect any of my networks as well. Actually running wireless diagnostic doesn't yield any results, because it also couldn't find my network.\nThis started as soon as I bought new router, but I did have different problems with my old ones and this same MacBook. Seeing as my other devices work just fine, I assume router is not to blame. Anyway I could post my network settings if it's somehow relevant.\nReinstalling OS X is not an option, since 1) it's not an actual solution and 2) this is corporate MacBook.\n\nA: Yesterday I've played with the router a bit (even though I thought it's not to blame) and figured that my country code (transferred via 802.11d) was set to TW (factory default I guess). And almost every other network has RU country code. So I've changed my router's country code to RU (lost couple of channels and ability to serve 802.11ac) and after that I haven't experienced any problems with connection (yet).\nI think (not 100% sure though) that my other devices just ignore country code or don't use 802.11d protocol at all.

Right now, it will only back up the Mac internal hard drive.  I need it to also back up the external hard drive.\n\nA: Yes - you should be able to backup your external drive with the photos by removing it from the \"Exclude\" tab in the Time Machine pane in System Preferences (in this case the external drive is FCPX):\n\nAs Nancy Casas also mentioned, a disk in gray will have to be reformatted for Mac, while one in black will not.\n\nA: You should be able to back up any external HD, if it's formatted for a Mac. \nBy default, all externals are excluded and shown in the exclusion list in Time Machine Preferences > Options.\nIf you see it there, in black, just select it and click the minus sign at the bottom.\nIf you see it in gray, that means it's not formatted for a Mac, and Time Machine can't back it up.

It shipped originally with 10.10, so that'll be the earliest that you can install on it in any officially supported way.\nIt's important to note that when installing supported older versions of Mac OS X on a Mac, you can use the standard installers for all versions except for the original OS version that the model shipped with. To install this version, you should use the Internet Recovery based installer (or for older models, the recovery discs that came with your Mac).\nHere be dragons...\nIf a machine is sufficiently similar to a previous generation and has enough driver support, it might be technically possible to get a prior version of OS X to boot on it, but it's almost certainly going to require manual tweaking to bypass the system identifier checks that happen. It's a totally unsupported thing to do and very likely to be unstable. You're almost in Hackintosh territory here.\nIf you really want to try this, borrow a friend's older Mac and make an installation of 10.9 to an external drive and try booting it on your Mac mini (holding down the option key at boot to boot from the external drive). If it doesn't boot, try booting it into safe mode. If that doesn't get you any further, try verbose or single user mode, which can give you hints as to what's stopping it booting and what you might have to tweak.\nNote: If you're booting from an external hard drive, you'll have to be quick to press the keyboard shortcuts to trigger these different boot modes after you hit the return to boot the Volume.\nWhy do this?\nIt's common for Mac developers to need to do this. If you're developing software for the Mac and you're supporting anything older than the latest version of Mac OS X, you should be testing your app on all OS versions that it's supported on.\nFor example, I've got a 13-inch MacBook Pro (Early 2011) that has partitions (~35 GiB each) for every Mac OS X version from 10.6 onwards that I keep up-to-date with system updates, plus extra partitions for the beta releases of the current stable Mac OS X release and the beta releases of the upcoming Mac OS X release. Keeping an old machine around (at a frugal spec) for this purpose is also a good for QA because it ensures that you're also maintaining acceptable app performance on slow old hardware that your customers might be using (I've also keep a 2008 MacBook Pro and PPC Mac mini for this purpose).\n\nA: You probably can not do this. The older versions of the Apple OS X operating systems are not capable of running on hardware yet to be designed. For this to work, Apple would have to have released an updated version of OS X 10.9, which they have not done. Therefore, OS X 10.9 will not be able to recognize your newer machine's hardware.  \nPS: Apple has a support article for this as well, see Use the version of OS X that came with your Mac, or a compatible newer version.\n", "Q: Control packets with pfctl Looking for a way to control precisely which process or application is allowed to communicate with the network in a low connectivity context, I found the pfctl command which seems to be designed for the job.\nI would like to allow only a few applications to connect to the network (ie: ping and Mail) and remove Apple unnecessary services.\nHere is my current /etc/pf.conf file:\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nnat-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nrdr-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\ndummynet-anchor \"com.apple/*\"\nanchor \"com.apple/*\"\nload anchor \"com.apple\" from \"/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple\"\n\nI try to understand the pfctl status with this command:\n$ sudo pfctl -sr\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\" all fragment reassemble\nanchor \"com.apple/*\" all\n\nIs it possible to achieve the filtering I want with pfctl and how?\n\nA: PF (Packet Filter which command line interface of is pfctl) can't do this, because it's not application but port/interface based. You may block port 80/443 for a web browser (like Safari) but this will also block Mail fetching an web-based embedded picture in an email.\nYour best bet is to use a host-based application firewall like Little Snitch. The app allows a fine-grained control of outgoing traffic. You may even allow a browser to connect to text based (low traffic) websites while blocking all other sites.\nYou can even set up several profiles for low- or high-bandwidth locations.\n", "Q: Having to hold links and webpages to open them I'm having to hold and press links in Safari to open the pages - I used to just touch it and it would open.

For most people, most of the options should be disabled (except for shaking the screen to undo an action which is by preference).\nI have a possibility. Are General > Accessibility > Touch Accommodations > Touch Accommodations + Hold Duration both turned on? Because they make it so that you have to hold on the screen in order to register a touch. That seems to fit your context because they should be off in general.\n", "Q: iMac13,2 (Late iMac 2012) I have 2 questions. The first is does it matter if the memory in the four memory slots are from different manufacturers? What is the best memory chip for this model iMac? I need 2 x 8 memory chips.\nThank you\n\nA: While it would be best to always use the same brand and part number for all your memory, this can not alway be done. You have to also consider that even if you this, there is no guarantee the chips were made during the same fabrication run or that they were even made by the same manufacturer. All you can hope for this that the chips were tested to insure they meet the brands published specifications.  \nThe best advice would be to add memory in pairs and to buy the pairs together in the same memory kit. Otherwise, make sure the store has a good return policy (just in case).\nYour computer uses PC2-12800 DDR3 memory.\nBuying the Apple brand is probably the most expensive way to go. On line stores such as Micro Center sell Mac memory from the brands Crucial, Centon, Kingston and Patriot. The Patriot 2x8GB kit sells for $60 US.\n\nA: The specs on the RAM is: 4 slots for 204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM with a maximum of 32 Gb.\nAlthough RAM is supposed to be electrically identical from manufacturer to manufacturer, I recommend you get RAM from a single manufacturer. There are many sources for purchasing RAM.\nMy personal (and professional) go-to for RAM is Data Memory Systems. I've purchased from them for many years, and my school has used them almost exclusively for at least a decade.\nDisclaimer: I (and my school) are satisfied customers of DMS, and have no financial stake in the company,\n", "Q: Apple TV, xfinity, and remote app I have my 3rd gen Apple TV connected to an xfinity hotspot (that's the only wifi I have right now) and the remote app from my iPhone 6 Plus S isn't finding it on the air play menu?

I tried three different apps too and none of them are working.\nSome help would be best appreciated.\nThanks\n\nA: Although I can't say for sure, my \"gut feeling\" is that this is a firewall issue - your router could be blocking ports 3689 and/or 5353.\nSee also: If the Remote app won't connect\n", "Q: What could cause a new network route to be added every time a website is accessed? We noticed strange behaviour on a Macbook Pro running OSX 10.11.6 where the routing table is populated with hundreds of host entries for every website/host that the user has accessed. If he accesses a new host you can immediately see the new routing entry. Examples of these entries below:\n17.171.8.16        10.0.0.1           UGHWIi          1        3     en0\n17.172.232.142     10.0.0.1           UGHWIi          2       14     en0\n17.172.232.150     10.0.0.1           UGHWIi          1        3     en0\n\nThe BSD docs show that the 'W' flag is 'The route was auto-configured based upon a local area network'. \nIf you disable the network adapter the entries are removed. If you re-enable it then immediately about 30 routes are created and then as the user accesses the Internet it continues to populate. This happens when using a web browser, Curl, SSH etc. However the routing entry is not added when you ping the host.\nDoes anyone know what could be causing this or how we can troubleshoot it?\n\nA: I discovered that these are cloned routes unique to BSD networks stacks which are displayed when you use the '-a' option to netstat.

The number of tabs has quietly grown over time, primarily through following links in Gmail that then opens a new tab in Chrome.\nBut how can I easily manage and view all these tabs? (To ultimately close what I no longer need.)\nThe only methods for viewing/switching tabs, that I'm aware of, is to carefully slide the tabs left/right to slowly reveal the tabs or swipe on the address bar to navigate forward/back through the tabs. Neither of which is a practical solution to managing an enormous number of tabs. (I don't even know how many tabs there are - there are loads!)\nIdeally, I would like to view a vertical list of all the tabs (as you can on the Android app), or maybe even a thumbnail of each open tab (as you sort of can on the Android app - as part of the aforementioned list). But there does not appear to be anything like this on iOS?!\n\n\nA: In the most recent version of Google Chrome (currently on version 55.0.2883.79) has actually gone a long way to resolving this problem. There is now a Windows-like button to the right of the tabs (and the new tab button) that now displays a scrolling page of tab thumbnails.\n\nTapping that button results in a page of thumbnails representing the open tabs (you can swipe left/right to show Incognito Tabs and other devices that you are logged in to). However, the first few times I did this, only a few of the tabs were represented by thumbnails. It either took a bit of time or some navigating between the tabs for the remaining thumbnails to display...\n\nI had amassed in excess of 111 tabs (rough count of 37 lines of 3 tabs)! Some tabs were seriously old! Chrome itself worked perfectly OK with this number of tabs (I think the tabs just go to sleep as navigating back to them triggers a full reload), but scrolling through this long list of thumbnails the first time was a bit jerky on an iPad Air 2.\n\nA: One way to navigate a lot of tabs with Chrome on the iPad would be to somehow get a list of them out of the device, since this would then allow you to finally close them and start over. Using the list, preferably a clickable webpage, you'd be able to refer to the sites you want and click to re-open them as needed. The problem then becomes that with Chrome/iPad there's no obvious way to get a list of the open tabs either.\nFor that, a solution is that you can essentially \"export\" the list of all your open tabs by using Chrome Sync to synchronize the iPad to your Google account in the cloud. To do this, you have to authorize the Chrome browser itself to log in to your Google account. Don't head for a web page to do this; instead look in the Settings menu for Chrome itself. After you enter your Google account information, a sub-option for \"Sync\" should appear; swipe it for the detailed options and make sure the option to synchronize 'Open tabs' is enabled. Immediately, your iPad will upload the set of open tabs to your Google account online. \nIdeally, now you'd be able to inspect the Chrome Sync data by logging into your Google account online—this time on the web—and viewing it in your Google account profile, right alongside the tons of similar tracking data you can find at https://myactivity.google.com/more-activity. You'd be able to browse this secure webpage with any device from anywhere and you'd even be able to use an iPad—such as the same one the data came from—to browse around and click.\nUnfortunately however, it seems that Chrome Sync is a separate product that's not totally integrated with the rest of the Google data harvesting apparatus, so the only online hint that I could find of the data you captured is via the a single summary page https://www.google.com/settings/chrome/sync, which acknowledges the number of \"Open tabs\" that were synchronized, but doesn't seem to provide any way to actually list them (I did spend a long time searching to no avail, but since I always find the Google account pages entirely byzantine, it's still possible that the data is accessible somewhere).\nIn any case, failing the online option, you can still examine the \"Open Tabs\" list by using Chrome Sync in its intended way: on another device. Using a different, non-iPad machine, repeat the steps above to enable Chrome Sync and then go to the Chrome History menu. You'll see an additional section for your iPad in the pop-up menu, and if you go to the full page History view, you'll see a separate tab along the left margin which finally displays a clickable list of the open tabs uploaded from your iPad device.\nThis list is an HTML skeleton with most of its content generated by javascript. If all you want are the titles of the open web pages you can simply copy/paste from this page into any other app. But if you want the underlying URLs as well, you have a bit more work to do. You can either paste into an app (e.g. Microsoft Word) that supports a richer format which preserves the links—and where you know how to separate out the links, or use Chrome's Inspect Element developer features (or the [F12] function key) to grab the fully-resolved HTML after having been rendered by javascript.\nNow having walked through this approach, I must confess that the procedure does not work for Incognito tabs, for the simple reason that those pages are specifically excluded from participating in Chrome Sync.\nI thank @w3d for posting the question, and for his helpful answer too. Indeed I was already aware of the new thumbnail view feature in Chrome/iPad when I put a bounty on this question. That new view does not allow text selection or even displaying each site's URL, so they doesn't address my own specific need. In fact, since many of the tabs I'm trying to salvage are incognito, even the solution I describe here remains incomplete for me.\nI'm still hoping someone will describe any way to manually export a URL listing of all the open tabs—including incognito—from Chrome on iPad.\n\nA: In iOS (9 at least - my 4s wont accept 10) the Chrome browser window has a box with the # of tabs open. Pressing that expands the open tabs/pages and let's me scroll through them, or, close them by touching the X in the corner of the tab. Is there anything similar in the iPad interface?\nAlso, while I don't have an iPad, on my iPhone and AirBook I've synced my Chrome tabs (and likewise, I have 116 total tabs right now... heh.) It might be easier for you to sort them out on a desktop if you have a lappy or workstation. To do this you may need to reset your Chrome sync (which is at the bottom of your Google dashboard) on each of your devices and log in per each devices browser (even if you are logged in to the Google homepage already).\nHope that helps.\n\nA: If you're wanting a close all tabs solution, here's something from google's help site:\n\nClose all tabs\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Chrome app.\n  \n*At the top right, tap Switch tabs (the window). You'll see your open Chrome tabs.\n  \n*At the top right, tap More (three dots).\n  \n*Tap Close All Tabs.\n  \n\nIf you're looking for something to see all your tabs, the tab viewer, which looks like a window, seems to do a fine (albeit buggy) job.\n", "Q: Always boot windows, unless option is held down I have a 2012 Retina Macbook pro I use for work, with software that is windows only. \nI'm getting a bit tired of having to remember to hold down the option key every time I reboot.\nI know I can tell bootcamp to \"reboot into windows\", but that only sticks for one reboot.\nI want to always boot into windows, unless I hold the the option key.

I can't install it from the appstore on my phone because the latest version of iBooks require iOS 10.\n\nIt says \"This app needs iOS 10.0 or later\"\nBut according to this link, I can install it through iTunes and then synch it with my phone to get an older version.\nExcept for the fact that in iTunes (latest version) on my 2 computers (Win10) I can't click on the \"get it\" button, it is grayed out like shown on the capture :\nBut I can download any other app without any problem.\nSo how can I get iBooks on an Iphone 4 OR any free app wich allow me to read pdf (not from links or mail, but the one I've synch with my phone) ?\n\nA: As the above comment states, you do not need iOS 10 to download iBooks. However, given the info in your screenshot, it is possible that iBooks is not available in your country.\nEDIT: iOS 10 is not out. I have no idea why it would require you have it.\nPlease review the following article and make sure your device is compatible.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201478\nSEE ADDITIONAL EDIT BELOW\n\nI just looked at the App Store, and it DOES appear you need iOS 10!\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8\n\n", "Q: Letter 'c' is randomly inputted by dragging mouse on Mac I'm running Windows 8.1 on Parallels 10.4.0 for Mac. My issue is that every time I double click my mouse there is a 'c' character randomly inputted, which is very annoying. There is a solution from this link talking about the same issue, but I am unable to get this to work.\nHas anyone ever had the same problem?\n[Update] I found that the same issue exists when I use mathematica on OS X. When I drag click and drag the mouse, there will be an 'c' inputted. I doubt that it may be some software from OS X that caused the problem...\n\nA: This was caused by a dictionary app called Youdao.

However, how do I remove a colour?\nAll the articles I have read suggest dragging an adjacent white cell onto the colour, but the empty cells are no longer white and and attempting to drag an empty cell does nothing.\nThanks\n\nA: \nThe Colors dialog can be used to modify the swatch selection.  Specifically, selecting and using the delete key, or by dragging to the trash can. You can also use this to rearrange swatches \nHigh Sierra 10.13.4 Beta\n\nA: A good way of doing this is editing the ~/Library/Colors/NSColorPanelSwatches.plist file. Open this file in a plist editor or in Xcode, and remove all the Item 1, Item 2 and so on entries, leaving Item 0 as it is.\nThe .plist should end up looking like this:\n\nRestart the app/color picker and the color swatches should be removed\n\nA: This does not apply to your case with El Capitan (still don't know how to easily delete a color in that OS). But things have changed with High Sierra (untested in Sierra). Simply drag a swatch to the trash to remove it.\n\nA: You can actually just drag & drop them to your desktop trashcan.\nThis works in High Sierra, I'm not sure if it does for previous versions.\n\nA: Just discovered today, March 2018, you can now just select the color chip (soft online indicates it's selected) and use \"delete\" key.\n\nA: You can drag a defined swatch onto another defined one. One gets overwritten, the other blank again. Kind like playing \"musical chairs\" …Works even in El Capitan.\n\nA: Using the eye dropper actually does work. What is interesting is that once you drag it to a swatch that swatch becomes \"blank\" you can continue to drag that to other swatches and \"blank\" those out, but if you go back to a swatch you blanked out, that one is no longer draggable. The only draggable \"blank\" swatch is the last one you \"blanked\" out.\n\nA: Just drag the saved color to the Trash on the dock!!!\n\nA: After searching and testing, I've found two ways to remove your color swatch, TV under MacOS Catalina.\n\n\n*\n\n*drag the color swatch to the trashcan in the dock\n\n*click the color swatch your want to remove and press cmd+delete on the keyboard\n\n\nA: I found another way to do this\n1) Go to your desktop\n2) Click control+click on the trackpad \n3) Go to \"change the desktop background\"\n4) In the options choose \"fit the picture to the screen\"\n5) You will see the margin color in the right side and click on it\n6) Now the color plate will open and you can click on them and click command + delete\n", "Q: MacBook Pro El-Capitan erase / format CD-RW I have a 2012 MacBook Pro running OSX El Capitan 10.11.6.

Run this script, which downloads the Yosemite Recovery Update, copies out Disk Utility, and patches the version for use on El Capitan.\nNote: It also tries to copy it over the current El Capitan Disk Utility, which failed on my machine due to system permissions.

This is the first time I open it since I installed el capitan.\n\nA: Are you logged into your apple account, and is it active with Game Center?

But as long as your host is a Mac, you could also try looking at the partition via the command line tool diskutil, although in my experience in El Capitan this tends to work almost as poorly as the new Disk Utility GUI.\n1. List your disk partitions with:\ndiskutil list\n2. Find your VirtualBox partition on this list - it will probably be something like /dev/disk1s2\n3.

When I plug in my Apple earbuds to record audio, much like I do on my iPhone for video blogs, I can use the earbuds microphone to record crisper audio than the internal mic. I want to do the same on my Mac.\nWhen I open Quicktime and I select an audio input (whether I'm doing a screen recording or audio recording), it only allows me to select the internal microphone, whether they're plugged in or not.\n\nI tested to see if it was picking up my earbuds and if I had the speakers on, and take a screenshot. The internal audio mic picks up the noise every time.\n\nA: A simple google search pulled this Apple document. According to this, your mac must be equipped to use the Mic and Remote for the Apple Earphones. A simple way to check is to go to System Preferences > Sound > Input.  If there is an \"External microphone\" listed in the Input tab, your computer can use the microphone included with Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic.\n", "Q: How do I boot up my laptop from an external backup drive, or how do I verify that a backup is good? I want to upgrade my Mac to at least OS 10.9. It's running 10.6.8 now and has an Intel Core i5 processor. I've been making backups to an external drive via Time Machine, and I read that one step before upgrading is making sure my backups are good.

But I was recently told that my current OS doesn't support booting up from my external drive, which I confirmed (the drive doesn't show on the screen while I have Option pressed during startup). What are my options for making sure the backups are good?\n\nA: Head over to System Preferences < Time Machine and then select the \"Show Time Machine in menu bar checkbox\". From the menu bar, select time machine and select \"Enter Time Machine\". Now make sure your latest backup is visible there and you can see your files, this will ensure you have performed your backup correctly.

I would not bother with Apple-branded connectors. They are called \"duckhead connectors\" and other brands are widely available, individually and in sets, online both in the U.S. and in Europe, and much less expensive than the ones that say Apple.

This will still briefly open a window, but there's no way to have Terminal on launch do absolutely nothing.\nYou might want to check out iTerm2.\n", "Q: How do I destroy postfix on mac os x I see these two log statements non-stop in my console logs..\n\nI have previously tried to eliminate postfix using this command\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n\nand\nsudo launchctl remove /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist\n\nBut it keeps coming back to life after every reboot.\nDo I really need postfix? I am a regular GMail user and I don't need any system apps to send emails.\nI tried using the instructions at \nHow can I revert my etc/postfix/main.cf file?\nto reset my postfix configuration to the stock version with the hope that it might start working normally but it did not help.\n\nA: sudo rm /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist  will prevent postfix from starting at launch and being daemonized (if it has been installed in a usual way). This will effectively prevent postfix from running. However, removal of all files and config is another matter. If you installed using a package manager then that’s the way to remove it. Otherwise you have to search your computer and remove postfix-related files.\nThe unload comando just stops a service from running but, as you have noticed, starts again at boot because the plist file is still present.\nYou probably don’t need postfix on your Mac. It’s mostly for use for sending mail from a server (smtp server)—Gmail, yes, does that for you. You might have installed postfix so PHP can send emails, but for development you could try a faux postfix that logs instead of sends like Mailhog.\n", "Q: iTunes cannot sync photos to the iPhone because your iPhoto library is not yet available How to fix this issue and sync iTunes to iPhone correctly?\nOS X Yosemite, iPhoto 9.6.1, iTunes 12.4.3.1; iPhone 5, iOS 9.3.3\nI imported my pictures to iPhoto then tried to sync some unrelated changes to the iPhone through iTunes and got this error message.

FAT and FAT32 file systems support file attributes like \"read only\". How can I change those under OS X? The standard chmod command does not seem to do the trick. How else can I do this?\n\nA: Under OS X, the FAT/FAT32 file system Readonly attribute is set when a file is locked. When a file is viewed in the Finder application, a small lock will appear on the file icon. This Readonly attribute can be set or unset by highlighting the file and then selecting \"File->Get Info\" from the menu bar. The Readonly attribute can then be modified by checking or unchecking the box labeled \"Locked\". \nThis also can be done from the command line. First, to view the attributes use the command below.\nls -lO <filename>\n\nTo set the Readonly attribute use the following command.\nchflags uchg <filename>\n\nTo reset the Readonly attribute use the following command.\nchflags nochg <filename>\n\nTo set the Hidden attribute use the following command.\nchflags hidden <filename>\n\nTo reset the Hidden attribute use the following command.\nchflags nohidden <filename>\n\nTo set the Archive attribute use the following command. Note: this command is the opposite of what one would expect to enter.\"\nsudo chflags noarch <filename>\n\nTo reset the Archive attribute use the following command. Note: this command is the opposite of what one would expect to enter.\"\nsudo chflags arch <filename>\n\n\nNote: The System attribute does not seem to have an OS X equivalent.

I installed it via Homebrew (brew install mtools).\nThen I took a look at which device I wanted to manipulate: diskutil list. In my case, this was /dev/disk3s1. So I unmounted the disk: diskutil unmount /dev/disk3s1.\nThen I followed the instructions from this blog:\n\n*\n\n*Create a ~/.mtoolsrc with this content: drive s: file=\"/dev/disk3s1\" mtools_skip_check=1\n\n*Use mdir and mattrib to navigate around and change file attributes\n\n*Unmount the whole disk: diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3\nI would have to use the tools with sudo, though: sudo mdir s:, sudo mattrib +r s:/some/path.\n", "Q: Can I have different audio come out of my computer and monitor? I previously had my monitor set up through a VGA cable and I was able to play music through an audio jack on my monitor — All while listening to something else through my headphones plugged into my computer. Now that I switched from VGA to HDMI, it doesn't seem to do the same thing. \nIs this possible with an HDMI cable? Or is this only a VGA thing?\n\nA: HDMI (unlike VGA) combines audio and visual in a single cable — VGA just does visual. \nYour monitor was using the audio jack as an input, and playing sound from the source connected there (music player, etc.). Your computer was using its audio jack as an output, playing music to your headphones.\nNow that you have an HDMI cable, your monitor most likely uses its audio jack as output, because it already has an input for sound — the HDMI cable. My guess would be that if you plugged in headphones to your monitor, you would hear the sound coming from your computer.\nThere is a way to have the monitor and computer speakers play the same output (Audio MIDI Setup), but I don't think you have have two different outputs.\n", "Q: Windows 10 Update Anniversary I have installed Windows 10 on my Mac with BootCamp.

So what else can I do?\n\nA: If it's greyed out, you obviously have an Admin restriction.  Your option is to get the Admin to change this setting for you.  I am assuming that Outlook is the default mail client of your organization.  Just explain to him/her that it's very inconvenient to have Mail as the default that always pops up when Outlook is the company standard.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina 2012 - sensor issue I have a late 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina Display and recently I've had some issues with it. Firstly it began to not charge properly - the charger light would stay orange and never go to green, and it wouldn't boot up (I imagine the battery was discharged and was failing to charge). This seemed to resolve itself but lately it has been unusable due to the system being extremely sluggish (taking 10 minutes just to open Safari), and the fans being at top speed constantly.\nAfter some research I discovered I could run the Apple Hardware Test to diagnose any hardware failures/issues, and it indeed find a failure with the code below\n4SNS/1/C0000008: Ts0P--124\nAfter some research I discovered this is an issue with the palm rest temperature sensor - which makes sense as obviously the system is running away with itself and running the fans at max speed. I've tried resetting the PRAM and SMC to no avail.\nI'm unable to get an appointment at the Genius Bar for at least a week and I do not drive so I can't drive to one with more availability so I'm wondering if there is anyway to fix this myself. If not, would this likely require a full logic board replacement or is the sensor quite simple to replace?\n\nA: The temp sensor is in the track pad so if you choose to undertake this repair, this is the part your are going to have to replace.\n\nThe PN# for the track pad for MBP 2009-2012 is PN# 922-9063.  The good news is that it's under $30 at the time of this writing.\nTo change out your track pad, you will need to remove the battery from the top case assembly.  iFixit.com has an excellent tear down which details how to do this.\nNote:  You won't have to completely disassemble the unit, but you will have to remove the battery to gain access.  You can remove it by gently prying it up with a plastic putty knife.  I have even seen dental floss used to slowly work the battery loose.\n\nIf you are not comfortable doing this repair, I suggest you let a tech handle the repair.\nI was able to find a YouTube video showing the battery removal.  Once it's removed, you will be able to get a good idea of where the track pad is located.\n\n", "Q: Why is this playlist copying the wrong songs to my iPhone? I have a rather complicated playlist in iTunes called \"Headbang.\" It looks like this:\n\nThere are about 50 artists included in that final criteria. This works perfectly in iTunes and the playlist gives me about 1,500 songs.\nWhen I sync my iPhone and tell iTunes to include that playlist, I get a playlist on the iPhone that is named \"Headbang,\" but the playlist has 5,995 songs, and I have no idea how they're selected. All of the songs that in the iPhone's version seem to be 4-star, and I do have another playlist called \"4 Star Music\" that is copying over, but it has only 5,935 songs, so it isn't exactly the same list of songs, although \"4 Star Music\" might be a subset of \"Headbang.\"\nI tried duplicating the playlist, but that didn't work, and neither did renaming it. I haven't manually recreated it yet because of how many artists are included. The only way I was able to get a playlist on the iPhone with those 1,571 songs was to select all the songs in the smart playlist and manually create a new playlist from them. Obviously I'd like to use the smart playlist if I can figure out what's wrong.\nNote that I don't seem to be having problems with other smart playlists. So, any suggestions on how I can get this playlist to copy the correct songs to my iPhone?\nHere are the current version stats:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro 17\" (mid 2010), macOS 10.11.5\n\n*iTunes 12.4.3.1\n\n*iPhone 6S Plus 64 GB, iOS 9.3.3\n\n\nA: Well, I tried a different tactic. Barring the \"Location\" criterion, the playlist is basically, \"All the 4 and 5 star songs by this set of artists that isn't Christmas music.\" I have a 4 star smart playlist, a 5 star smart playlist and a Christmas playlist, so I took the time to create a \"Headbang Artists\" playlist (BTW, 97 artists), and created a new smart playlist that had the criteria of, in \"Headbang Artists,\" not in \"Christmas,\" and in either \"4 Star Songs\" or \"5 Star Songs.\" This synced successfully.\nI'm guessing the other playlist is corrupted somehow and that the duplication of it also duplicates the corruption somehow. But I'll keep it around for a little while in case anyone else knows how to actually fix it in case someone else has a similar problem.\n", "Q: Recover Files in iCloud I uploaded a garageband song-file to iCloud on my iPad. Unfortunately i deleted it from iCloud (on my iPad) and its gone on both my iCloud drive and iPad local storage. Is it possible to recover my deleted file on iCloud or iPad?\n\nA: Yes, you're in luck — this is in fact possible!\nLogin to iCloud, and then click your name in the top right of the page, and then click \"iCloud Settings.\" Scroll to the bottom of the page, and in the bottom left hand corner you should see an \"Advanced\" box:\n\nThen, click \"Restore Files,\" and it will take you to this window:\n\nIf your files are not in this window, then I'm afraid you're out of luck!\n", "Q: Multiple screens Apple community!\nIn a couple of months, I will be setting up a booth at my high school. My booth will probably have some sort of table or desk for my MacBook (see below for specs) and more relevantly, some type of tv or screen. I will need to be able to loop a video either from a file or YouTube (it doesn't matter as I will have it as both) on the screen, which I will probably connect to through my Thunderbolt port, which I can adapt to HDMI.\nHere's the tricky part: I will need to be able to show people various things on my MacBook's screen at the same time as the video is looping. I am well versed in screensharing, but that will (obviously) not work in this case.\nSpecs:\n\nThe Apple MacBook \"Core 2 Duo\" 2.0 13-Inch (Unibody - Late 2008/Aluminum) features a 45 nm \"Penryn\" 2.0 GHz Intel \"Core 2 Duo\" processor (P7350), with two independent processor \"cores\" on a single silicon chip, a 3 MB shared \"on chip\" level 2 cache, a 1066 MHz frontside bus, 2 GB of 1066 MHz DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-8500) installed in pairs (two 1 GB modules), a 160 GB Serial ATA (5400 RPM) hard drive, an 8X DL \"SuperDrive\", a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M \"graphics processor with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory\", integrated iSight, and an LED-backlit 13.3\" widescreen TFT active-matrix \"glossy\" display (1280x800 native resolution).\nConnectivity includes AirPort Extreme (802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports, optical digital/analog audio in/out, and a new \"Mini DisplayPort\" that supports an external display at 2560x1600. It does not include a Firewire \"400\" port.\n\nI will say that I've updated to Yosemite, a 500 gb solid state memory, and 16 gb of ram.\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to extend (not mirror) your desktop.\nHave your video playing on the external monitor while your MBP screen will be free to show other items.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure each display is properly connected and powered on.\n\n*From the Apple () menu, choose System Preferences.\n\n*From the View menu, choose Displays.\n\n*Click the Arrangement tab.\n\n*Disable (uncheck) \"Mirror Displays\".\n\n\n\n", "Q: iPhone heats up and uses lots of data once a day I've got a new iPhone SE with all settings transferred from iPhone 5. \nI noticed that once a day, at around lunchtime, the phone heats up for around an hour or two, eats half of the battery and presumably also sends or receives a lot of data over 3G because every few days I get a SMS from my provider alerting me that I used 80% of my prepaid 1GB data. The phone is not on charger when this happens (I usually it recharge overnight).\nThis wasn't happening on the old iPhone 5 - there the 1GB of data lasted for a month or more and battery on light use easily for 2 days. \nI doubt it's the iCloud backup - it should only run over WiFi and while the phone is in charges (or so it says at least). I also have the background refresh turned off, email on manual fetch, firmware 9.3.3 (latest as of now), etc. All I could think of that could trigger some background activity was disabled. Yet still it happens every day.\nWhat's going on here? Thanks!\n\nA: Go into your cellular setting and start turning off apps that you don't want using cellular data. You might be able to narrow down which one is doing it. Also, make sure your hotspot setting is turned off.\n", "Q: iCloud Mail Not Deleting - Very Slow - Have to Delete Multiple Times I can't pin this bug to anything specific so I'll try to give as much info as possible.  This bug started about 3 or 4 months ago for me.  But around that time I did enable the \"Today\" inbox and that is what I use 90% of the time now.  The problem is I'll swipe left to send a handful of e-mails to the trash then leave the app.  Next time I check e-mail most of them are back.  I have to swipe left to delete them all over again.  Usually after two or three deletes they stay gone.  What gives?\nI'm running iOS 9.3.4 & OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.\nUPDATE: I downloaded Airmail. In Airmail I added my @icloud account and one of my @gmail accounts. @icloud.com e-mails still won't stay deleted, they keep reappearing (not all, just random ones).  @gmail seems to be fine. So it doesn't appear to be the app that I'm using. Is this an issue with @icloud email?\nUPDATE: I tried rebuilding the mailbox twice using the default Mac Mail app.  No joy.  After it was rebuilt I selected about 10 emails to delete, press delete, it says in the bottom left \"Moving Messages\", stays that way for 2-10 minutes, then finally goes away. I switch to my gmail inbox then switch right back to the icloud inbox and they are back again.  I've repeated this many times.  When it says \"Moving Messages\" in the bottom left it seems to take a very long time.  Very frustrating.  Sometimes I've seen an error message popup saying it couldn't delete because mailbox was busy (something like that).\nI also tried accessing mail via www.icloud.com, after selecting a handful then deleting, and waiting a long while, it would throw a message saying it couldn't delete them.  I then tried deleting 1 at a time via the icloud website and they delete but it thinks for a long time before it actually disappears.  So it seems like deleting is veeeeery slow and works 1 at a time via icloud website, but multiples don't delete/timeout or something.\nAny help would be appreciated!  I couldn't find any solutions on the Apple forums.\nUPDATE: I changed my icloud password just in case it was something malicious.  Didn't help.

This was not an issue with any of my work emails or gmail address or yahoo address, etc... It was only a problem with my @icloud.com address.  I finally gave up and just started deleting years worth of e-mails via www.icloud.com.  It took a long time because like I said, deleting was VERY slow.  It did seem to gradually get faster the more and more e-mails I deleted.  After deleting about 3 years of e-mails (and along the way deleting them from trash also), the problem has now seemed to resolve itself.  Deleting/moving/etc from www.icloud.com still seems slower that I think it should be, but at least I can delete icloud e-mails using the mail apps on my iPhone and they no longer reappear.\n", "Q: Have a mac acccess apache through localhost on a windows environment Some people on my network use Mac so I have to configure my local server for them to access it. I installed Apache on my Windows Vista PC and you can access it from any other WINDOWS computer on the network just by entering localhost on the address bar. But you cant do that on a Mac for some reason.\nThe only way I know is to enter the local IP of the server machine but since it changes every time is really not practical at all. How can I fix this?\n\nA: It has nothing to do with Mac vs. PC; it's a Windows Server network one. Even still, it's not an issue of deficiency in Windows Server or Apache, but rather one of knowledge of network administration.\nResolving hostnames in a multi-platform, networking environment is basic. It wasn't even hard to do 16 years ago, when I first encountered this issue as the sole Mac user in my company.\nI do not know, but suspect, that you need an IP address to the DNS server, which you can then manually supply through the Networking pane in System Preferences (or some such). This, though, is just a guess, but I doubt I'm that far off.\nAs far as whether the Mac is worse or better than Windows on any networking issue is a ridiculous argument to have, as anything networking-related on the Mac is older than the Mac itself (and therefore not really Apple's own machination), and any such thing found in Windows is probably a derivative of the same thing found on Mac.\nThis argument could have been had in the days of AppleTalk and what-not, but that's been over since 1999.\n", "Q: How can I enable WiFi calling on an iPhone 4S? iPhone 4S (VZN Model) with IOS 9.3.2 unlocked and works with TMO.  What is the procedure / process to configure it for wifi calling.  As I understand it IOS 8 supports wifi calling.\nAs Bill Tanner has graciously pointed out, Apple indicates a 5C or newer model is supported.  I suspect that the 4S has the hardware necessary to perform wifi calling.  If this is not the case, I'd like to understand the gap that prevents wifi calling: I have successfully made SIP calls (a form of wifi calling) with the device. \nI do not believe this to be a duplicate of the question posed regarding the iphone 5   The question is not whether 4S is supported for wifi calling, but what (if any) procedure would be needed to enable wifi calling functionality.  It would not surprise me this feature is feasible with the 4S and that Apple is in a position to easily add it to the list of model that are valid for wifi calling code / instructions\nInsight into the procedure to enable wifi calling on the 4S would be appreciated.

When I check Console.app I see they are all having Excessive Wakeups.\nAny ideas on what to check or how to debug this would be much appreciated!\n\nA: The concept of excessive wakeups is just a checkpoint to start data collection for programs that cause a large energy usage.\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing if the program is expected to do significant work, but without this monitoring, system admins and Apple don't have actionable data to find misbehaving or misconfigured programs.\nThe wakeups may or may not be related to the crashing - so I would focus on identifying candidate programs and then see if the crashing itself is related to the code or the data.\nMake a new user account and then when you log out of the affected user and  in to the new user without any saved settings - you can launch the same program that was crashing.\nIf the program still crashes - you can conclude that the OS and/or specific build of that program have issues to investigate. If not, then you can conclude that the history of opened documents or the specific document is causing the program to abort or otherwise behave poorly.\n\nSo, I would gather a little more data in the following categories if I were to tackle a problem like yours:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the list of all programs on the watch list for a 24 hour period?\n\n*What count of errors for each?\n\n*For each program, is the error reproducible on a new user account?\n\n*For each program, is the error reproducible on the main account (launch three times, all three abort)?\n\n\nYou might find that there are different causes for different apps and need to be methodical to isolate and then use different approaches to remedy each instance. Or they might all trace back to a bad system that needs to be backed up and installed cleanly.

I have tried SO MANY TIMES to get a bootable USB working, but nothing is working. I have reset PRAM, used many different software, and more. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \nEDIT: I have gotten it to boot, but it gets stuck on this line:\n[    15.419970] fb: switching to radeondrmfb from EFI VGA\n\n\nA: I tested booting from a USB flash drive on a (20 inch, mid 2007) iMac.\nFirst, download the file ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso from the Ubuntu web site: Download Ubuntu Desktop.\nSecond, erase and format a flash drive for a single MS-DOS (FAT) volume using a Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme.\nNext, transfer the iso file to a USB flash drive using UNetbootin. This application runs on Windows, OS X and Linux. The instructions, when using OS X, are given at this site: How to create a bootable USB stick on OS X.\n\nNote: The message shown below is wrong. The USB flash drive can be used to boot off a Mac.\n\n\nThis flash drive did appear on the Mac Startup Manager menu. By selecting the icon, I was able to boot to a live version of Ubuntu.\nThe Ubuntu installation software places the Ubuntu startup files (GRUB) in a EFI partition. Unfortunately, the Mac firmware ignores these files. Therefore, nothing representing the Ubuntu installation appears on the Startup Manager menu. \nWhen holding down the Option ⌥ at startup, the Mac firmware will look for the \\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTx64.EFI file on each EFI partition of all drives accessible at startup. Each occurrence will generate an icon with the label \"EFI Boot\" on the Startup Manager menu.\nSearching, for the BOOTx64.EFI file in the folder \\EFI\\BOOT on a EFI partition, is part of the UEFI specification. For example, if you go to the \"uefi.org Specifications web page\", you can download and view the \"UEFI Specification Version 2.5\". Sections 3.5.1.1 Removable Media Boot Behavior and 3.5.1.2 Non-removable Media Boot Behavior (on pages 88-90) describe the naming of the BOOTx64.EFI file and that it should appear in the \\EFI\\BOOT folder.\nWhen Windows installs, some of the startup files are stored in the folder \\EFI\\MICROSOFT. These files are also duplicated (with some renaming) in the \\EFI\\BOOT folder. Not all non-Apple operating systems do this when installing. For example, Ubuntu Linux does not. (Well, last time I installed in EFI mode it did not.) The Ubuntu installer does create a folder \\EFI\\UBUNTU with startup files (GRUB), which the Mac firmware by default ignores. To get Ubuntu to appear in the Startup Manager, you have to manually mount the EFI partition and copy the files in the \\EFI\\UBUNTU folder to the \\EFI\\BOOT folder. (Also, the copied grubx64.efi file needs to be renamed to BOOTX64.EFI.)\nIf you need to do this for two operating systems, then you will need a second EFI partition. This should not present a problem since an EFI partition is fairly small (<200 MB) and the limit on Macs by default is 128 partitions. However, to tell one operating system for the other, while viewing the choices presented by the Startup Manager, you may want to change the icons.\nFor example, I have rEFInd installed in a second 134 MB EFI partition on my iMac. (This happens to be the last of 9 partitions.) Additionally, I have Windows 10, Yosemite (on volume \"Steelhead\") and El Capitan (on volume \"Steelhead2\") installed. Below is a image of my Macs Startup Manager menu. (For a better view, click on the image or open in a new window.)\n\nThe icon can be changed by mounting the EFI partition and adding the icon file .VolumeIcon.icns to the root folder. A collection of these icons, for popular Linux and other operating systems, can be found here.\n\nNote: While the Mac Startup Manager can be used to boot Ubuntu, this extra step is unnecessary when Ubuntu is the sole installed operating system. In this case, one would be better off by blessing Ubuntu so this operation system is always chosen at Startup. The process for doing this is beyond the scope of your posted question.\n\n", "Q: USB devices intermittently disconnecting For a long while now I've experienced USB devices intermittently disconnecting on my Macbook Pro Retina 2012 (El Capitan 10.11.2).\nI'm currently using a Targus 7 port USB 3 hub (http://targus.com/au/usb-30-7-port-hub-with-fast-charging) but this problem existed when I was using an older USB hub. I bought this one in the hope it might resolve this problem, but it didn't.\nThis USB hub is connected to its power adaptor.\nFrom memory this problem also existed before El Capitan update.\nFor work I use Microsoft Lync for Mac, and I sometimes notice than when a new instant message arrives, my keyboard, mouse and headset will disconnect. But they also sometimes disconnect without this trigger.\nTo reconnect them, bizarrely, i seem to need to unplug and replug each device in 3 times specifically.\nIt's very frustrating and inefficient for my workflow. Just wondering if there are any suggestions or recommendations as to how I can troubleshoot or resolve this?\nFollowing are screenshots of the USB map (two separate screenshots as the contents of the USB 3.0 Bus details page didn't fit in one screen)\n\n\n\nA: Disclaimer: this is an answer under construction.\nOpen the  > About This Mac > System Report...,\nselect Hardware > USB,\nand open every small ▼.\nSelect the USB bus where is connected your USB hub, and enlarge the\nlower part of the window to have a complete vue of all your USB equipments.\nMake a screen capture: commandshift4, space, select the USB map window and click.\nYou will get something like:\nInclude this screen capture within your OQ (original question).\nVerify that the sum of the Current Required (mA) of all the equipments\nconnected to the same internal USB hub don't exceed the Current Available (mA) for the hub. This value might be different depending on the USB port available outside and what is already connected on it internally.\nAs a basic simple rule, avoid the external USB port which is on the bus where is connected the FaceTime HD camera (Current Required (mA) = 500 mA).\nFor example, on a MacBook Pro, I discovered through trials that my FaceTime HD camera is on the bus with the USB external port nearest from the front.\nTo check this hidden cabling, just use your external mouse.\nConnect it on port nearest from the front. Hit commandR in System Report... to refresh the USB connection information.\nNote on which bus is this external USB port.\nRepeat the same operation for port farthest from the front.\n\nA: After trying every possible combination of hubs and configurations I could try, and with the very helpful guidance of daniel Azuelos (other answer) it turns out that in my scenario, everything started working seemlessly when I attached a USB 2 hub to the USB 2 port in my Macbook Pro (on the left), and attached only USB 2 devices to that hub.\nI attached the USB 3 hub to the USB 3 port (on the right) and attached only USB 3 devices to that hub.\nIt seems when doing this everything stays connected and stable.  \nIn particular the problem seemed to be arising when having USB 2 devices attached to any hub on the USB 3 port (regardless of whether the hub was USB 2 or USB 3). I don't know why this behaviour occurs, but keeping 'like with like' has worked in my situation. \nInterestingly, the USB 2 hub is unpowered.\nI do audio production meaning I sometimes use a LOT of USB devices, including eLicensers, an audio interface, synthesisers etc. And the USB 2 devices just did not like being on the USB 3 port. \n", "Q: Find all illegal Windows characters in a folder and subfolder I need an Automator script which finds all files with illegal Windows characters like <>:/\\\\|?* and replaces these characters with an underscore. The rest of the filename should remain unchanged.\nAs an alternative, I would use a terminal script. I know how to find them with find . -name \"*[<>:/\\\\|?*]*\", but I don't know how to change the names properly.\nHow do I do this?\n\nA: I found a bash one-liner that finds each file and folder with invalid characters in the name and renames the file/folder, changing each invalid character to a dash:\nfind . -name \"*[<>:\\\\|?*]*\" -exec bash -c 'x=\"{}\"; y=$(sed \"s/[<>:\\\\|?*]\\+/-/g\" <<< \"$x\") && mv -n \"$x\" \"$y\" ' \\;\n\nIt is possible that a file has an illegal name that would be corrected to the exact same legal name as another illegally named file (Example: two files named \"fle\"). The one-liner above will not change the name of the second (or further) illegally named file that would be corrected to the same name as the first. This means that you may still have some illegally named files after the one-liner runs. After you run this one-liner, run\nfind . -name \"*[<>:\\\\|?*]*\"\n\nagain to identify any illegally named files that still exist. One way to deal with this situation is to change the dash in the sed substitution to another character, e.g. underscore, and run the one-liner again.\n", "Q: Where is the mic located in apple earphones?

I'm trying to create a virtual machine for Windows 7 x64. However VMWare Fusion automatically decides that the disk size can be 60GB and no smaller.\nHow do I create a virtual machine with a smaller disk?\n\nA: VMWare Fusion (which I'm assuming you're using since you're posting in the Apple section) has some presets for disk space depending on the OS (20 GB for Linux, 60 GB for Windows, and 40 GB for OS X) when you create a new virtual machine.

This would be really useful for my online college assignments because half of the screen would be taken up with the notes I take on the iPad and the other half with the problems and I could easily solve algebraic problems.\nI would prefer not to use screen mirroring just so it was easier to save the files on the Mac and interact with the scribbles directly on the Mac (zoom in, rotate, etc)\nI would prefer to do it over Lightning cable just to avoid any WiFi delays my school has.\n\nA: There is an app called Astropad that allows this. http://www.macworld.com/article/2885834/first-look-astropad-turns-your-ipad-into-a-graphics-tablet-for-your-mac.html\n", "Q: Use Windows XP sounds in OS X? I have a zip file of all Windows XP sounds. Is there a way I can replace the standard OS X sounds with these?\n\nA: You technically can't replace the sound files as they are protected by SIP (well... you could by disabling SIP, but that's another discussion altogether), but you can add sound files to your own personal library.  This is much easier to do.\nThere's basically two steps to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert your WAV file to AIFF.  \n\n*Copy the file to ~/Library/Sounds (Note that this is located in your user directory and not the SIP protected /System/Library directory).\n\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to use FFmpeg1  Just issue the command ffmpeg -i <path><name of file>.wav ~/Library/Sounds/<name of file>.aiff and it will do both steps in one shot.\nThe nice thing about using FFmpeg is that you don't have to manually open each file in QuickTime as you can do it right from Terminal.  This also means you can write a quick batch file to do all your sounds if you like.\n\nOnce you do that, it should show up in Sound Preferences as a \"Custom\" sound (I created an \"Ask Different Sound\" specifically for this example).  Be sure to completely close out of System Preferences (if open) before going into \"Sound\" so that it can load up the new files.\n\n\n1  FFmpeg is open source, free software that converts almost any audio/video file from one format to another. Simply download the binary and make sure it can be found in your path.  I just copied it to /usr/local/bin so I didn't have to modify my path at all.\n", "Q: Mirror iPad Pro to MacBook Air I use the PDF Expert app on iPad Pro to annotate documents using the Apple Pencil, and it works brilliantly.

The account is logged in on Safari, but I don't know the password.\nIs there any possible way to save the password and get Safari to autofill the password when I log out and fill the username?\n\nA: No, there is no possibility to retrieve the password at this stage.

How can I get rid of the partition and the Free Space?\n\nA: If you are using El Capitan (OS X 10.11), then the document you are referencing will not work as expected.\nAs for your question. The command below will remove the Linux Swap partition.\nsudo diskutil erasevolume \"Free Space\" \"\" /dev/disk0s3\n\nThe next command expands your Macintosh HD volume to contain the free space.\nsudo diskutil resizevolume /dev/disk0s2 R\n\n\nNote: I am not sure if the prefix sudo is necessary. (But, it will do no harm if you include the sudo)\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Try: open Disk Utility, select the Linux Swap partition, in the toolbar there should be a delete disk option, try that, and try to remove the partition.\n\n*If 1 didn't work, try use First Aid in Disk Utility (first on the partition and then on the main drive)\n\n*If 2 didn't work, try to boot in to Recovery Mode, select Disk Utility from the menu, and try option 1 and 2 again.\n", "Q: iCloud container taking excessive disk space I have almost no disk space left on my MacBook Air.\nHaving run Disk Inventory X, one of the main hogs is the files under Users/MyName/Library/Containers/com.apple.cloudphotosd/Data/Library/Application Support/com.apple.cloudphotosd/services/com.apple.photo.icloud.sharedstreams/assets (assets contains several folders with gobbledygook names).\n**The content here seems to be my iCloud Photo Sharing shared photos (ie. \"Shared\" in Photos), which is about 21.9Gb large.\nI don't understand why this is the case, since my \"Photos\" folder (ie. library) is only 12.94Gb large (local storage is optimised, real library more like 52Gb).**\nMy MacBook Air early 2015 has the 120Gb storage and runs OS X 10.11.6\nSo, what is this folder mentioned above, why is it so large, and can I delete any of it without losing my Shared photos or the photos streams which I have been added to?\n\nA: The iCloud files come down from the cloud, so you can't really delete a local copy as it will start downloading again. Instead, let's review the settings that control what data comes down. \nIdeally, you can turn off iCloud on the Air and let the OS delete all the content so you have space to work. (Bad things break in odd ways when the boot drive fills). \nOpen iCloud preferences and under photos turn off either/or/both:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo library \n\n*iCloud photo sharing \n\n\nThe first will be your pictures existing only on other devices and Apple servers. The second is all of the shared photos that other people have shared with you and you have shared with other people.  I even know of some people who use iCloud photo sharing to share photos only with themselves because these photos don't count against the free 5 Gb storage limit.\nYou are correct that the folder you found is for shared photos. If you can't free up other space on the Mac - you can opt out of some sharing of images / movies that are large. I also find the optimize photo size option handy on mobile devices when I don't need the full resolution of photos in my local copy of the Photos library:\n\n\nA: MacWorld has an interesting article on this subject. Unfortunately, it boils down to there's not much you can do, but you can try disabling iCloud Photo Library and deleting the com.apple.cloudphotosd folder, then re-enabling iCloud Photo Library.\n(Not sure why you have to disable iCloud Photo Library first, but that's what the article says.)\n\nA: I found this answer was the cure to my problems; a disk space shortage.  I just put a new SSD in my imac from 2009, which runs like a rocket now, and after 3 months, I was running out of space without putting hardly anything on it!  \nAlso, unless you are willing to pony up for icloud space, then you'll most likely have to store photos on your imac locally, taking up space or prescribe to another clound storage solution.  We use dropbox, which was the bellweather before Apple got into the cloud storage realm.  We use that, but our account is so large now, about 110GB, that linking dropbox and any of our computers, takes up a lot of space on them.  So we access it through a browswer and that works fine for our needs.  Primarily its for backing up photos anyway.  We pay $99/yr for 1TB of storage.  \n", "Q: How can I get 2560X1080 resolution on my LG 29UM58 monitor, connected to a Mac Mini? I just bought the LG 29UM58 21:9.

Preferably free, by the way, and also not counting Air Display since the newest version doesn't work on Windows.\nThe goal is this: just like you could extend the display of a Mac to a monitor using Thunderbolt, I would like to extend it to a Windows 10 screen using some software\nSo far, I have looked into multiple apps, such as AirDisplay, Splashtop, WIDisplay, Synergy, and ScreenRecycler as mentioned by bwall's answer. \n\nA: This looks like it will work. It's not free, but I haven't seen anything else that works. It uses a VNC client for the \"other\" computer, but it says any VNC client should work so you don't have to buy theirs. You only have to buy the Mac program. There are plenty of free VNC clients for Windows. There's a free trial so you can download it and see if it works. \nhttps://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html\n\nA: I found Avatron Software that works on both Mac and PC hosts and will extend your display to iOS, Android, Windows and Mac devices.\nThe software isn't free ($20), but they have a free trial.  I downloaded a copy this morning and I am currently testing it out.  So far, it installed with no problem and I extended my iMac display to it quite easily.\n\nA: I had reasonable success using airserver which can make a windows laptop behave like a airplay device (and a chromecast device, and a miracast device). This feels like quite a nice \"standards-based approach\" in that it uses protocol.\nI could then set the airplay device in the \"displays\" sections of settings to this device. I needed to tweak the firewall rules to allow inbound connections to built-in services for this to work as outlined here.\nairserver has a 30 day trial and then charges money. There is also a free program called 5Kdisplay, which also implement airplay, but the display resolution is rubbish.\nI would kind of prefer to do something over USB, the refresh rate was a little low over airplay for me. I ended up using my phone as a hub when I didn't have access to a network.

Paste this into Terminal (after you read it and understand it, as always, because pasting random commands from the Internet into Terminal is dangerous):\nsetalarm() {\n    sleep $(echo \"$1 * 60\" | bc)\n    say \"Beep boop\"\n}\nsetalarm .1\n\nThat's 0.1 minutes (in other words, 6 seconds).\nIf you want to make the alarm repeat until you press Ctrl+C, then paste this instead:\nsetalarm() {\n    sleep $(echo \"$1 * 60\" | bc)\n    for x in $(seq 1000); do say \"Beep boop\"; sleep 0.5; done\n}\nsetalarm .1\n\n\nA: Try this: https://www.apimac.com/mac/timer/\nIt has a clean and easy to use interface. It can be used to start multiple countdown timers, stopwatches as well as set alarms.\nYou can also set simple tasks instead of just an alarm tone like, open an application or read out some text, etc.\n\nA: I use http://www.timer-tab.com and I love it. I don't need multiple timers so its effective at doing its job and staying out of the way. You can run it in your browser. You dont need an app since its web based.\n\nA: This isn't necessarily a regular MacOS application, but if you are alright with using the Terminal, termdown is a really nice Terminal Stopwatch. Starting a timer is very simple. For example, termdown 1h30m starts a 1 hour 30 minute timer. .\n\nA: I use a countdowm timer that works great and is simple. It's called Countdown Widget and you can select to countdown based on days or time. I'm currently using it to countdown days till baseball season starts again. But it will countdown in seconds as well.\n\nA: Dont know when they introduced it but macos has an app on board. \n\nA: This little script might be useful for small tasks.\nCopy & Paste in the Terminal\nalias timer='for i in `seq 1 65535`; do sleep 1s; clear; echo $i $( echo Seconds ) ;done'\n\nType timer\n", "Q: Disable 'find cursor' shortcut in iTerm2 By default iTerm2 uses shortcut ⌘/ to find cursor on screen.\nAnd I want the sortcut ⌘/ to apply to another action.\nBut I can't find out how to do this on new version of iTerm2.\nHow to disable find cursor shortcut in iTerm2?\n\nA: If you want to define the key sequence in another app, then make iTerm2 ignore it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iTerm2 Preferences... --> Keys\n\n*Click on + under the grid\n\n*Press ⌘+/ with cursor in the Keyboard Shortcut field\n\n*Leave the Action field value set to Ignore\nIf you want to use different action in iTerm2, assign the appropriate action in step 4.\n", "Q: My entire music collection is gone from Finder I do not use iTunes but instead store my music files in nested folders in /Users/User/Music. I recently downloaded Tomahawk, a music player. \nI decided quickly that I preferred to stick with VLC for playing music, only to find that I can no longer use VLC as all my files are removed from my music folder. I restarted, and some of the files appear in Tomahawk program while other are gone. It seems unlikely (and would be very unfortunate) if the files have been totally deleted; I imagine they are hidden somewhere on my computer. Where can I find them, and/or is it possible to reset my system to a few hours ago or restore them in some other way?\nNote: it is not the entire folder that has been removed. The folder structure (subfolders for each artist, etc.) remains, and other files, like images of the album covers in .jpg format, remain.\n\nA: It seems unlikely it would delete them, but I don't know how that app works at all...\n...so, assuming Tomahawk has moved the files to its own cache/storage location, you could try using something like EasyFind (freeware) - which can search hidden locations far more easily than Spotlight - to look for either Folders containing the name Tomahawk, or one or two actual music file names.  \nChances are, you find one, you've found them all.\nWithout Time Machine as a quick revert, moving them back to their original locations may not be so simple - it might be a case of dragging each one back to its correct folder, one at a time.\n", "Q: How to delete one specific file permanently in OS X Yosemite? My MacBook is running Yosemite 10.10.2.\nI want to delete a single file permanently using command-shift-delete but it asks \"Are you sure you want to permanently erase the items in the Trash?\" which is something I don't desire.\nI only want to delete this one single file from my Macbook. How can I achieve this?\n\nA: From what you said in your question, I'm assuming the file you want to delete is already in the Trash.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/) type the rm command followed by a space.\n\n*Click the Trash Dock Tile to open a Finder window to the Trash. (Note that if the target file is not in the Trash just bring up the target file in Finder.)\n\n*Drag and drop the target file from the Trash (or whatever Finder window it's in) onto the Terminal window. This will add the fully qualified pathname of the file to be deleted to the rm command.\n\n*Example: rm /Users/me/.Trash/googlechrome.dmg\n\n*Press enter and the file should now deleted.\nFor additional options to the rm command have a look at: OS X Man Pages for rm\nIf the target is a folder use rm -dr ... where ... is the pathname of the folder to be deleted.\n\nA: The answer of rm is best; however if Terminal and the command line make you squeamish, you could create a temporary folder on your desktop, move all the Trash contents except for the file you want to delete, empty the trash, then move the files back to the Trash from the temporary folder. \n", "Q: How to remove EPSON Projector Audio driver? I made the mistake of installing the EPSON Projector Audio driver. It gets selected all the time, now, even when there is no EPSON Projector around. There's no obvious way to get rid of it. How do I make it go away?\n\n\nA: Had the same problem, note that the folder name is actually EMP_UDAU.kext. Once you delete this folder and reboot your Mac, the EPSON projector audio option is gone from the system.\n\nA: Also to remove the toolbar app, search for \"usb display uninstaller\" in Spotlight.\nStart the app and confirm uninstall (you will be asked to restart the computer).\n\nA: Go to /Library/Extensions and delete the \"EPSONProjectorAudio.kext\" kernel extension. The pesky EPSON Projector Audio driver should be gone after reboot.\n(If you can't see the Library folder on your hard drive, try Finder > Go > Go to folder… and paste /Library/Extensions)\n\nA: As mentioned in: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6778963\n\nGo to Finder and select your user/home folder. With that Finder window as the front window, either select Finder/View/Show View options or go command - J.  When the View options opens, check ’Show Library Folder’.

While opening up my iPhone 5s to replace the screen, I ripped this ribbon that was stuck to the LCD shield plate and I was wondering what it's called and what it's function is?\n\nA: It's the grounding plane.  Basically it reduces electrical noise and interference. Replacing it would be ideal but, if it's a very small rip, you should be okay.  Very small being 1mm or less.  It may function with a bigger rip but I'm not sure how that will affect the performance of your device.\n\nA: I removed this when installing a new flex and so far I can't see any problem. Only thing that doesn't work is the auto brightness (there is not option at all). I don't know if this is related but maybe could be ? the sensor is in the same flex of the camera etc.\n\nA: It's a grounding ribbon, connected to Touch ID and works to ground the static from our touch.\n\nA: Ground plane...  don't remove it.\n", "Q: Can I Upgrade My Mid 2009 15 Inch Macbook Pro past it's maximum memory limit to 16gb? I have a 15 inch macbook pro (mid 2009 1.8ghz core 2 duo) and I want to upgrade the memory. It currently has 4gb (2x2gb) and the maximum Apples says will work is 8gb. I am wondering if I could get away with 16gb (2x8gb). I know this is possible on certain other macbooks, I am just wondering if it will work on my model. \n\nA: According EveryMac.com no Macbook Pro models build before 2010 had an actual maximum RAM of 16 GB. If your Macbook Pro is a 2009 year model, then your maximum actual RAM should be 8 GB.\n", "Q: Do alternatives to the default Twitter app use less data? I'm currently using the default Twitter app, and it's apparently used 13.9 GB since I purchased my phone in December. Do alternatives to the default Twitter app use less data, and if so, what are they?\nIdeally, the app should not have a purchase price, but that isn't a hard requirement. I'm only using one Twitter account, not multiple accounts. I have an iPhone 5S.\n\nA: I'm not aware of another app that uses less data but you can reduce your data usage on Twitter for iOS 10: \nSettings -> Data -> Video auto play -> Use wifi only\nThis will stop videos from playing automatically. I suggest you reset your cellular statistics and see how much data you use now. If you want to go even further you could turn off Image previews on that same \"Data\" page.\n", "Q: \"Offline mode\" in iOS disabling radios I want to put my iPhone on offline mode completely. That way no-one can find me using Cell Towers or GPS. I want to keep my phone on.\nWhat is the best way for doing that?\n\nA: Switching Airplane Mode on entirely disables the Wi-Fi, cellular and Bluetooth radios in your iPhone. To disable GPS as well, go to Settings → Privacy → Location Services and switch the toggle off.\n", "Q: Language spelling menu switch I understand that Mac OsX should recognise the language automatically - and to say the honest truth - it does but... on rare occasions I need to see which language in\"ON\" and what are the choices...\nMenu indicator-switch would be of great help - maybe an extra function to the keyboard indicator would solve the problem.\nI use 4 languages in many programs... \n\nA: One way to maximize the ease of changing the spellcheck language is to use an app which allows you to synchronize the keyboard layout and the spellcheck dictionary.  I think both Nisus Writer and Mellel have this feature.\n\nA: You should be able to see your selected lanugate in your menu bar if you have the option turned on.\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard, make sure you have the option \"Show Input Menu in Menu Bar\" checked\n\nYour Menu Bar should now show a flag with the corresponding language\n\nWhen you click on it, you should get a selection of the input sources you currently have available.\n\n", "Q: Storage not displayed properly in \"About this mac\" section Please refer to the image to see how Storage is showing me the space division.\n\nIts showing amount of space available correctly but the division below is incorrect as you can see it is showing 249.72 GB for Apps and I only have 249.78 GB total space.\nWhat can I do to correct this?\nEdit :\nHi guys, thanks to everyone who responded and provided there inputs to solve my problem, really appreciate it.

Still not sure what does other signify and I am pretty sure that the space allocated to apps is wrong, is there anywhere I can check other than storage about how much space is allocated to Apps?\n\nA: I had a similar problem, and rebuilding my Spotlight index solved it for me.\nSimply restarting my computer (a less time costly operation), has also worked in the past.\n\nA: The spotlight database and indexing process does generate the data, so if you are able to use Activity Monitor to look at all processes (or top -u -s 10 at the unix command prompt) you might let spotlight finish indexing and see if this is a temporary situation due to poor estimates of the files on the disk.\nIf this is something that persists more than 48 hours (set the OS to not go to sleep), I would capture spotlight diagnostics in terminal by running mddiagnose and then make a full backup and contact Apple Support.\nIf you don't have support, the next step would be to erase the drive and reinstall the OS. After a clean install, spotlight should index over an hour or three and the settings should be 100% correct.\nAt that point, you know the OS works, the hardware works. Then you can restore files and apps from the backup.\n", "Q: 6S Plus iOS 9.3.4 no dictionary The iPhone 6S plus has no dictionary. No matter which app I'm in. If I highlight a word and ask to define it it shows no results. I click manage to try add dictionary and nothing shows up. There is no list just an empty page. This happens in EVERY app. How can this be rectified?\nI have tried resetting keyboard dictionary, reset all settings, restoring the phone. All to no avail. \n\nA: Change region or language or both.

Specifically, I would like to start and stop play of an MP3 on iTunes, or a track on Spotify, using an Arduino connected to the Apple computer with USB.\nI can print to serial from the Arduino. I can use Screen in Terminal to access the Serial info from the Arduino. I can start and stop playing of tracks on iTunes and Spotify using Applescript. I need some way of having keywords in Screen to trigger start and stop in iTunes or Spotify. I have searched for this in various ways, but cannot find anything other than suggestions to write a script to interface between Screen and Applescripts. This is where I am stuck.\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: This is probably far too broad to provide a practical answer, but here's an outline of how you'll need to reason about automating OS X.\nTry to pick an app that is built for automation: https://www.macosxautomation.com\nIf you can leverage that interface, you'll be very much closer to a solution. If not, there are three more general purpose methods to control OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*command line scripting - so you'd need to have the arduino ssh in to the Mac OS as a legitimate networked device just as you could ssh in to OS X from ubuntu, Windows, iOS or any other OS. Once your arduino can open a network connection to OS X - you can use AppleScript, JavaScript, bash, swift and many other languages to send messages to iTunes or other scriptable apps.\n\n*USB interface - Apple designs the OS to be accessible to foot switches, screen readers, breath control, joysticks. If you were savvy enough to program your arduino to emulate an assistive device then you could go to the Accessibility system preference pane and then allow your arduino to control the mouse, the keyboard, etc...\n\n*voice control. The macOS changes would let you start work on your arduino to synthesize a voice and then connect the voice synthesizer to your sound input (or just use a microphone) to speak to the OS. http://www.practicalarduino.com/projects/speech-synthesizer\nAgain - these might be a large project for anyone that has no background, so you will want to focus on automating your OS X automation first. Once you can play/pause things on OS X to OS X - then you can see if you can replicate those things from arduino.\nIf you wanted to have the arduino send serial commands to a program on the Mac - you'd need to first learn to program how to process serial input and then you'd need to learn how to have that program script one of the above methods. Again - you'll need to focus on small achievable steps and then build on them to make a system.\n\nA: I got it.

If you the format either the 2nd, 3rd or 4th partition as MS-DOS(FAT), the partition method should change to hybrid.\nYou probably will not be able to install Windows 10 using a EFI boot method. You should use the legacy BIOS boot method. This means you want to use a hybrid partitioning scheme.\nYou should be able to download the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" (BCSS) using the Boot Camp Assistant. Although, for some Macs this download is the same as for a Windows 7 installation.\nWhen running the Windows installer, you will need to reformat the MS-DOS(FAT) volume as NTFS.\n", "Q: IOS accessibility: Turn page in iBooks with headphone buttons / bluetooth keyboard? I am trying to help someone with disabilities to turn pages in e.g. iBooks on the iPad. All I need for this is a single button, possibly one that iOS can interpret as an accessibility switch. \nI have looked at bluetooth switches that are made for this purpose, but it always seems like I have to purchase at least two devices (that amount to the equivalent of about USD 200) even in this simple use case. We're not aiming to control the whole OS, just to turn pages.\nIs there no way to just use $10 earphone controls as a switch instead? Jailbreak or not.\nOr can pages be turned in iBooks with a paired Bluetooth keyboard? That would be great.\n\nA: I found out the hard way (went to a store) that you can use arrow keys on a Bluetooth keyboard to change pages in ePubs, but not in PDFs. At least in iBooks. \nThe problem now is that it doesn't work in apps that can read Adobe copy protected ePubs.\n\nA: The e-reader app Marvin has a feature that let you turn pages using the arrow keys on a Bluetooth keyboard :)\n", "Q: How do I delete a purchase that is on my music that I don't want How do I delete a purchase which is on my music that I don't want\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*In the Music app, find the name of the song, album, or playlist that you want to remove, and tap the More Options icon. \n  \n*From the menu that appears, tap Delete.\n  \n*To remove the song, album, or playlists from only the device that you're currently using, select Remove Download or Remove Downloads.

I want to restore my iPhone 6 because I can't temper my restrictions passcode. Will restoring my iPhone also take away the money I have in my iTunes gift card? And will my phone number be deleted too?\n\nA: The money in your iTunes account will remain as it is linked to your iTunes account (the Apple ID) rather than the specific device. Your phone number is obtained through the SIM card in the device, so this is not affected by restoring either.\n", "Q: Extract Installer Package Signing Certificates from xip archive It's possible to extract Code Signing Certificates (CSCs) from an .app or signed .dmg as ASN.1 (DER) with\ncodesign -d --extract-certificates prefix /path/to/file.dmg\n\nAfter that you can do stuff with it using openssl, security etc.\nMy goal is to do the same for signed xip archives, which use Installer Package Signing Certificates (IPSCs). You can verify xip signatures with\npkgbuild --check-signature /path/to/archive.xip\n\nBut there doesn't seem to be an option to actually export the certificates the way codesign can do it with CSCs.\nIs there a way to do it from the command line?\nThe eventual goal is to deal with xip archives that are signed with self-signed/self-issued IPSCs. It will be a script that first checks the signature with pkgbuild, and then, if the user wants to, it should export the certificates, and then add them to the keychain as trusted. I know you could always just dequarantine the xip file with the self-signed certificate, and this will be an additional option, but this is always on a per-file basis, so there also has to be the ability to extract the certificates (root/leaf) and import them into keychain as trusted (or trusted root). How I'll do the latter I don't know yet, but first thing's first.\nThank you for your help.

A marginal machine can keep running for a long time past when it can actually pull off an install let alone an install/upgrade in one pass.\nThe benefit of this is you keep your data safe (assuming you don't have a backup) and don't have to wait hours/days for migration of settings and data to know if the simple OS install worked or not.\n\nA: Why don't you apply for membership of the MacProUpgrade Facebook group ?

More than likely, not all 30 iPads will be in use, probably 15 on average. I bought this router thinking it could handle the load of iPads, but we seem to be having major slow down issues every now and then. I thought it was related to the speed of the Internet, but turns out the connection from the iPads to the router was severely degraded. I couldn't even get the Routers configuration page to pull up on an iPad connected directly to the wifi. I ended up completely turning off half the iPads and rebooting the router and speed increased drastically.\nTherefore, what would be the best way to go about hooking up 30 iPads to the same network? \nFYI, I'm using Configurator 2 to push the same profile to all iPad's to automatically connect to that wifi network. \n*Side Note: Anyone know of a way to stop an iPad from requesting automatic updates? This could cause a lot of network strain if 30 iPads try to update at once. The messages are also quite annoying.\n\nA: This can be easily solved by getting the proper infrastructure, not just a router.\nThe specs of your router don't matter.  What you are going to find is that after about 5 (maybe 10) devices simultaneously connect, your speeds are going to drop.  This is because each iPad (device, actually), regardless of what you are trying to do is attempting to use 100% of the bandwidth.  It's the nature of the TCP/IP stack; not your router or device.\nI know this from having to deal with a government client that provided free wireless for the jury pool.  When people would come in one at a time, wireless was fine.  When they came in en mass, the WAP would crash.  It didn't matter if there were less than 30 people in the pool or 100.  If they came online en mass, Wi-Fi was down.\nWhat you need is\n\n\n*\n\n*At minimum 4 WAPs\n\n*Enterprise Grade WAPs that allow you to throttle bandwidth to each client.\n\n*The AP's configured in as a mesh (Ubiquiti has this baked in)\n\n\nTry Ubiquiti Networks WAP's.  They will have the features you are going to need.\n", "Q: I put some mp4 videos into a working iTunes U folder. How do I get iTunes to recognise them? I want to play videos using iTunes U. I put them into the correct folder. But cannot see them in the iTunes U section in iTunes on os x.  Do I need to tag them or something?\nMy files are mp4. They are in the same folder as other files which work which I downloaded from the iTunes Store. What is different about the iTunes store files? How do I get my mp4 files to work in iTunes U?\n\n\nA: The meta data for a video file destined for iTunes must have the right internal identifier for the file type.  \nFor example, I might rip a DVD then encode it with handbrake.  If I throw this file in iTunes to move to my iDevice it thinks it is a home movie.  Slight inconvenience.  I use a free program, meta z, to set the internal identifier to \"movie\" and now it will show up in the right place.  Meta z also can set cover art and other web scraped data to make rips look professional.  A similar kind of processing needs to happen for iTunesU content.\nYoutube will not preserve the internal file meta data that iTunes needs for the file to be identified as an iTunesU file.  Meta Z can set whatever bit of meta data needs to be set for the file to be associated as an iTunesU file.  iTunesU is in the video type dropdown in Meta Z so it should work though I have not personally tried it.  Though you will also have to set all the other meta data too, which may be annoying.  \nMeta Z is free so give it a shot I guess.\nGriff.github.io/metaz/\n", "Q: macbook pro blank display I am facing the issue with my laptop as when its starts its booting and chime sound is present but the display is blank and after sometimes, the display becomes grey. Sometimes it will work fine means display is working perfectly\nI tried with changing RAM, reassembled display cable, but sometimes it will work, sometimes not.\nMy laptop is not in warranty, I checked with the service center they said some issue with either LCD or logic board, so they have to replace and it costs similar to buy a new laptop. \nIf I use with an external display, will it work?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my Macbook Pro (Not in Warranty). Apple Genius Bar was able to get it fixed in $150. They replaced the logic board and screen. For the time being, using the external display is probably the best choice.\n\nA: I think that the graphic card is damaged... Apple service obviously suggest you to replace the entire logic board, but you can save some money and bring it to a eletronics lab: look for \"reballing service\" (means replacing the solder contacts between the gpu and the board).\nIt should cost you about 150$. \n", "Q: When I drag a pix from Photos to the desktop, why doesn't it stay where I dropped it? I'm using El Capitan and the Photos app.\nI drag-and-drop a photo from Photos onto a visible spot on my desktop.\nThe problem is, the photo icon appears elsewhere on my desktop, so to do anything with it -- double click to open in another app -- I have to minimize my application to locate it wherever it end up on the desktop.\nI feel like Mac OS X didn't used to do this, that it file icons appeared exactly where they were dropped.\nIs there some setting I have to enable/disable to make this work?\nThanks!\n\nA: It seems you have some kind of auto arrange enabled. Right-click on the desktop and disable Sort By / Arrange By.\n", "Q: Is it enough to install Xcode? I use OS X El Capitan. I installed Xcode 7 from AppStore and macports from an official website.\nWhen I'm trying to install something using macports: sudo port install nodejs4, I'm getting the following warning: Warning: The Xcode Command Line Tools don't appear to be installed; most ports will likely fail to build.. But compiler (cc) works, make works, and I actually installed few macports packages without any problems.\nNow if I run xcode-select --install, I'm getting dialog to install Developer Tools. But I think that Xcode already has all those tools: \n$ xcode-select -p\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n\nSo the question is: is it some bug in macports or is there some tools not included with Xcode 7 which must be installed separately using xcode-select --install? I don't want to introduce unnecessary clutter.\n\nA: So I've inspected macports sources and it turns out that this warning is displayed, when directory /usr/include or executable /usr/bin/make is missing. While I have working /usr/bin/make, directory /usr/include was indeed missing. Installing command-line tools using xcode-select --install fixed it.\n\nA: You have to install the developer tools to run the C compiler and other build tools (e.g. linker, make) from the command line and provide support files e.g. include and libraries\nThe command line tools  are in places like /usr/bin and so installing via the AppStore cannot put the tools in the correct place. This a separate install step has to be done. \n\nA: As a comment on the original question said, you must go to Xcode's settings, then to the last tab, Locations. The options for which command line toolset to use is there.\n", "Q: MacOS dmg file question Not entirely sure if this is where to ask this, but I can't find another place to...\nI've recently switched from Windows to Mac and I am trying to understand more in depth what I'm working with.\nMy question is: are .dmg files the equivalent of .zip files in Windows? I came to this theory when downloading a .dmg and when I opened it, it contained a .app and and text file read me. To me, this seems like a compressed file. \nIs this correct?\n\nA: A DMG file (Apple Disk Image) is a disk image file that is mounted as a volume, just like a physical disk. They can be password protected and compressed (like ZIPs), and are usually used for packaging and downloading Mac software (amongst other things). \nDMGs are exclusively an Apple file format (though can be opened as read-only on Windows computers with 3rd party software), while a ZIP file is universal, and can be opened on both Mac and Windows. The nice thing about them is the ability to mount them, as I mentioned earlier. When you open a ZIP, it extracts the files to your computer, taking up more space on your hard drive. A DMG once mounted, however, can be interacted with and ejected without copying any files or taking up space on your hard drive. \n@klanomath said it best in their comment on this answer, so I will quote them here:\n\nAll valid DMGs contain a file system - so they are mounted exactly like a real partition to a file system. They get their own device/disk identifier (like all disks) Check diskutil list after opening a DMG.\n\n\nA: The .dmg file can be seen as a parallel to the .iso image file (only in a smaller size). \nYou can mount this kind of image file:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Windows) in a virtual drive and access it from there \n\n*(OSX) in /Volumes\n\n", "Q: Updating OS X to newer version Does updating of OS X operating system updates built-in software like Apache, git, PHP, Ruby ?

If you wish for more control over the versions used by certain software, you can use a package manager such as Homebrew.\n", "Q: How do I export iPhone contacts to Excel or CSV file?

What do I do to hit agree and update it? (I have a keyboard)\n\nA: Connect a USB mouse and you should be able to get online and accept any updates. \n\nA: Try to access the Mac remotely.

I'm using Gboard for iOS. Often when I enter a word using the swiping technique it comes up with the wrong word and no suggestion for the word I actually want. The word I want is often only 1 or 2 characters different so my instinct is to press backspace to correct the word but backspace deletes the entire word forcing me to re-enter the entire word again. Usually I end up doing this twice before I realize I have to enter the word by tapping instead of swiping to get what I want. \nAre there other methods of correcting/editing a word using Gboard?\n\nA: You can move the cursor by sliding your finger on the spacebar. Using this technique I can move the cursor back and fix a letter although fixing the last letter is a little problematic.

Truly a fantastic app.\nSome of the benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*plain text/markdown. So I can sync the data folder via dropbox and have access to all my data on iOS or another computer. Plaintext also allows me to use TaksPaper for task management.\n\n*Sparse and performant interace. Even though I have more than a thousand notes, search is extremely fast. Creating new notes is easy.\nWhat's becoming apparent though, is with that with such a relatively large amount of notes navigating and search is an issue. If I'm looking for a common word I get tons of hits. nvALT 2 supports rudimentary tagging but it's very basic (can't search or navigate by tags). \nWhat I'm looking for is an app that's similar to nvALT in spirit but supports:\n\n\n*\n\n*hierarchical folders \n\n*tags \n\n\nI've considered the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Evernote, the elephant in the room. However evernote uses a proprietary format and is slow. \n\n*Quiver looks almost exactly like a dream note taker, but it uses a custom (though \"open source\") file format.

It meets all of your criteria: it supports creating and organizing (with tags and hierarchical folders) notes in plain text, markdown, and other formats, as well as PDFs, images, and URL bookmarks. It also has a unique semantic artificial intelligence engine and other features.\n\nA: I've just ditched Evernote, 5 years too late. It's been a tough decision, since even the simplest of exported notes is buried under piles of formatting and metadata.\nnvAlt does the job for me. It has all the advantages you mentioned and tagging is not  problem for me. I just include the #tags anywhere inside the note's text. When searching nvAlt, you can filter results by words and tags; it will only show you the notes that contain all of them.\nAs with evernote, a good tagging system (and discipline) lets me do away with folders.\n\nA: The native Notes iOS app now supports tags for iOS 15+, see the support page Use Tags and Smart Folders in Notes on your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch\n\nThe tagged notes roll up like seen in this screenshot below\n\nThere appears to be a caveat however with reverse compatibility.

How can I have the name of the sender (from contacts) displayed in the SMS so I know from whom the SMS or iMessage is from?\nTo be more specific, this is not the problem with short names, but the names are not displayed at all, only the person's number. Obviously, I don't remember people's phone numbers, so I really need this to work.\n\nA: I just had this issue happen on iOS 10.0.2. It started after I signed out of iCloud and back in (all of my contacts are stored on iCloud). I tried some of the same things you tried, all to no avail.\nIn my case, I noticed that all of the old message threads showed \"+1 (nnn) nnn-nnnn\", but all of my contacts use the \"(nnn) nnn-nnnn\", i.e. no country prefix. On a whim, I edited just one of the contacts that was having the issue and added the +1 prefix to their mobile number. I switched back to Messages, and right away, not only was that message thread fixed, they all were! Then I went back to that contact, removed the +1, and everything was still fixed. An easy fix, but very odd!\nOf course, if you're outside the US you may need to use a different country prefix.\n\nA: I had the same problem as the OP, and the above answer from sclamage gave me the hint I needed: I had gone into my iPhone 6s (iOS 10.3.1) and turned off: Settings->{My Name}->iCloud->Contacts.

(Ran out of the warranty at this point so had to DIY, also no Apple Store near me, have to fly to one if need be). A while ago the right speaker starts to produce cracking sounds so I ordered a speaker online and replaced it myself. It worked for a while until today it started to produce similar noise again. I can take photos of the inside later today. I wonder if any of you might know how this malfunctioning appeared. I suspect it might be a software + hardware problem (meaning a software malfunction results at the speaker getting broken) but I might be wrong. Could it be overheating? It is really hot lately.\n\nA: This is a well known issue of macbook pro since 2009 and it effects even the latest model. The reason being the macbook speakers are not designed to resist heat. If it has been working for hours over 100 degree (or 30 some celsius idk) the rubber will melt and tear under high volume. The left speaker will less likely to have such condition since the ventilation is better on the left corner. Why does Apple keep using this type of rubber? I guess they want the rubber to be bouncy enough to make decent sound while keep the cost low. Besides Apple products are never built to last anyways. All you can do is to cool your macbook while using it or you can try to use superglue to cover the rubber, which would make it tougher but the sound will be worse. For a quick fix, you can put gel around the rubber or just the place of the torn mark(s). Take a look at this picture. This is how I did it.\n\n", "Q: Stuck after reset all settings + Home button doesn't work Thanks for reading. I'm in a bit of a pickle here.

In Finder, if you right click a file → Get Info, you will see a checkbox in the Name & Extension section that offers users the ability to Hide extension.\nIf you press Command (⌘)-Shift-3 to take a whole-screen screenshot on your Mac, a screenshot is saved as a .png file. By default, the .png extension for a screenshot is hidden.\nCan I change this hide extension status using AppleScript?\n\nIf you are curious as to why I'm trying to perform this action in AppleScript, it is because I have a script that involves taking & saving a screenshot, and then naming the file based on the text on the clipboard.

When one right-clicks selected text on a Mac, one is presented with various contextual menu items. Is it possible to rearrange these items?\nSpecifically, I would like to move the last item in this menu, which is a Service I created in Automator.app, to the top (or somewhere near the top) of the menu.\n\nA: I don't think that it is possible to reorder Services in the context menu.\nHere is the predefined order of Services in the contextual menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Local services (those available to all users).\n\n*The user's services.\n\n*Base system services.\n\n*Services that are loaded from the various applications that may have them.\n\n*Contextual menu plugins (located in the various /Library/Contextual Menu Items folders).\nThe Services in the context menu are sorted in reverse alphabetical order.\nApple is so strange sometimes.\nI don't know if others are the same way, but my brain is not sharp enough to quickly, mentally run through the alphabet in reverse. It probably takes me three times as long to scan through a list to find what I want (when a list is in reverse alphabetical order).\n\nI have one (admittedly unsatisfying) workaround to order one's Services\nalphabetically.\nIn Finder, navigate to:\n\n/Users/Me/Library/Services/\n\nThis is where one's custom Services are necessarily saved.\nSort the files in reverse alphabetical order in Finder by clicking on the \"Name\" header. First, rename the file that starts with the letter in the alphabet that is closest to Z. Specifically, add spaces to the front of the Service name. For this Service in particular, the number of spaces that precede the name should be equivalent to the total number of custom Services in this folder, minus one.\nDo this for all of your Services, adding one fewer space to the front of the filename as you progress, until you reach the file that starts with the letter in the alphabet that is closest to A. You can leave this file alone; the filename should contain no leading spaces. The more spaces that a filename begins with, the closer to the bottom of the context menu that that Service appears. You want this Service to appear in the very first slot. Thus, no space.\nIn short, one can use spaces as an informal way of manipulating the context menu's ordering of Services system-wide.\nOnce these updated titles appear in your context menu,*(see my below note) they will finally be in alphabetical order. The downside to this workaround, of course, is that now your context menu looks like the side profile of a staircase. Visually, it looks like each Service is nested within the previous Service, which may or may not bug you more than having your Services ordered in reverse.\nMe? I would rather have the staircase.\n\n*The process of how Service names are reflected in the context menu, in my experience, is haphazard. Sometimes, the Service title updates immediately after I change its filename in Finder. Other times, even after I restart my computer, the new name doesn't show up in the context menu.\nI have found that the method that I describe here is the only 100% reliable way to have a new Service name reflected in the context menu.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have a variable in the title of an Automator Service file? When one right-clicks selected text on a Mac, one is presented with various contextual menu items.  You may notice that some of the item titles contain the selected text.\nFor example, the Dictionary.app shortcut:\n\nLook Up \"selected text\"\n\nCan this level of title adaptability be replicated with a Service created by Automator.app? Or are Service titles completely fixed?\n\nA: The filename given in the \"Save service as:\" sheet, to the saved Automator Service, is what will appear on the Services context menu, sans the file extension.  It is fixed, sans renaming it, and cannot be a dynamic name automatically, as no mechanism is provided for it in a user made Automator Service.\n", "Q: How do I obtain the FileVault2 recovery key after it has been modified? The Mac is encrypted using filevault. If the user changes the recovery key using 'changerecovery' command, is there any event generated? And is it possible to get the new recovery key? \n\nA: In theory, you might be able to use the MDM hooks which are not publicly documented by Apple. In practice, it's easier to place an institutional key on devices so that you can manage things and not hope to receive updates to any personal keys.\nSee: https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=314\nOne MDM provider's framework is covered at http://resources.jamfsoftware.com/archive/Administering-FileVault-2-on-OS-X-Mavericks-with-the-Casper-Suite-v9.2.pdf\n", "Q: internal SSD and HDD together speed Hi I was thinking about adding an SSD drive inside my iMac mid 2011. I found that you can have both two drives in the iMac as long as you remove the dvd drive. \nI want to color correct a short film. The footage is Apple ProRes HQ (data rate around 300mb/s) and the total size 45GB (i found this using tha aja datacalc application). \nWould this be a good idea? Or should I buy an external SSD thunderbolt instead? Which set up would be faster? \nAlso if I buy an external SSD, would a size of 256GB be suitable for the job?\nThank you all in advance,\nRafael.\n\nA: The DVD drive is connected via SATA rev. 2.0 / 3Gbit/s. That means the SSD is gonna run at a max. of 300 MB/s approximately.\nThis link seems to indicate that there's at least a second drive bay (excluding the optical bay) inside the iMac, which runs at SATA rev. 3.0 / 6Gbit/s speed. It would be wiser to use either the second bay or upgrade your primary system SSD.\nSince the above link mentions the need to upgrade the EFI firmware, one should be aware the latest firmware updates can be found at the Apple web site \"About EFI and SMC firmware updates for Intel-based Mac computers\".\nIf you want to add an internal SSD, you can take a look at the ifixit guides, they can be used as a very good indicator as to how difficult the procedure would be.\nI would not recommend an external SSD. They are extremely expensive and don't really give you a plus. Thunderbolt SSDs are even more expensive because of their rarity. If I were you I'd consider the internal upgrade first.\n\nA: There are basically 4 options available to you. I will go through each one. I happen to have access to a 21.5 inch 2011 iMac. So, I am able to look up some of the specifications by viewing the System Report.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the optical drive with a SSD. The current optical drive has a transfer rate of only 1.5 Gb/s while the logic board is capable\nof 3 Gb/s. Therefore, this option would lead to a transfer rate of no\nmore that 3 Gb/s. This is usually far slower than the internal\ntransfer rate of a typical SSD. Therefore, this is probably your worst option.\n\n*Replace you HDD with a SSD. With the proper firmware upgrade, the logical board will be able to transfer data to a SSD at a theoretical\nrate of 6GB/s. The problem here is the your Mac was not designed for\nthis situation. The power cable connection to your HDD has additional\nsignals that determine the temperature of your HDD. Replacing with\nSSD will require inserting a aftermarket conversion cable between the\nexisting power cable and the SSD. This cable will also have a temperature\nsensor you will need to attach to the outside of the SSD. This option\nmay not be desirable, because you will loose your existing internal\nHDD. You will also need to purchase a kit, with conversion cable and\n3.5\" drive converter bracket, to install this drive.\n\n*Add a SSD without replacing the HDD. This option will be far harder to install than the previous two options. Again, with the proper\nfirmware upgrade, the logical board will be able to transfer data to\na SSD at a theoretical rate of 6GB/s. You will also need to purchase\na mounting kit with cables to install this drive.\n\n*Purchase an external Thunderbolt drive. The Thunderbolt interface operates a 10Gb/s which exceeds the internal transfer speeds of a\nSSD. So this option would not be slower that any of the previous\noptions. Most of these types of drives also come with a USB 3\ninterface. This may come in useful, if you need to use the drive with\nthe latest PC models.\n\n\nAs for the size of the SSD.

See screenshot attached.\nThe trashcan is empty so nothing is in there. Is there a way I can see what happened? \nI didn't have time machine turned on :(, so does that mean there is no chance for me recover my files?\n\n\nA: Time Machine is the only built in recovery solution, so the file changes are not logged in a way you could guarantee a trace of what happened if you didn't configure Time Machine to make external and/or local backups.\nIf you shut down the computer soon after you discover missing files, sometimes you can use software to look at free space and reconstruct missing files. That tends to work better on HDD as opposed to SSD, but some recovery is often possible. Not having the machine on actually increases the odds of recovery since you are counting on no other program over-writing the free space where those files used to be stored.\nI'd start with something like Data Rescue if you want to try to recover any files.\n\nOnce you've decided to not seek recovery or you've done the recovery, you might check the storage in Disk Utility to see if the catalog needs repair.\n", "Q: Disable user's ability to change FileVault recovery key How can we disable user's ability to change FileVault recovery key using fdesetup changerecoverykey ?\n\nA: Remove the user from the admin group would be the simplest method.

I have updated rsync to 3.1.2 (using homebrew) on my iMac running 10.11.6.\nMy problem: I use Finder to originally copy /source to /destination. Using Get Info, I see the size and number of items in source and destination are exact matches. Then I run the rsync command above to ensure destination is an exact match to source, but it rewrites many files (incl resource forks, .DS_Store files, etc) before completing successfully. But if I do another Get Info on source and destination the size and number of items no longer match.\nShouldn't destination be an exact copy of source after rsync, with the same size and number of items, etc? Shouldn't rsync exactly match destination to source, incl resource forks, hidden files, etc.? I am very inexperienced at Terminal and would appreciate any help and guidance.\nA further oddity: if I run rsync twice in a row, the second run still finds files to write/rewrite. Why is this? Shouldn't the first run have exactly synchronized the directories?\n\nA: rsync option -E is OK for the standard but too old version 2.6.9 of rsync which is provided with MacOS X (Mavericks, Yosemite & El Capitan).\nBut this option -E has another function with standard rsync.\nFor a user installer version 3.1.2 which is the right one on MacOS X,\nthen the standard options to maintain ACL and extended attributes are respectively -A and -X.\nHere you should use:\nrsync -aAvX --progress --delete /source /destination\n\n\nA: This is not the answer I was looking for, but it is the best answer to my question of how to use rsync to backup up folders/files. After a lot of research and testing, I finally gave up on doing rsync, it is beyond my limited capabilities and I could not get it to do what I wanted. Fortunately, I found a very good, cheap GUI to rsync in the App Store: SyncBuddy.

On my MacBook, I have various lists and information, of which I use TextEdit to edit. Usually, these will have indents where I use tab to create kind of charts with columns. Like so:\n\nItem 1 [TAB] Info 1 [TAB] Info 2\nItem 2 [TAB] Info 3 [TAB] Info 4\n\nI also use Evernote. It is a great app, but the text format support seems awful. When I copy these lists like the one above to Evernote, apart from the first column, I get a zig-zag of all the various parts.\nI've researched for a way to correct this within Evernote, but there doesn't seem to be one. Is there a way, to convert (using an application, AppleScript, etc.), type everything in a completely different text software as TextEdit, modify the settings in TextEdit, or anything else to make it so that copying text to Evernote results to what the original text was?\n\nA: For me, this only appears to happen when copying from a plaintext document to a rich text document (or vice versa.)\nMake sure your source and destination text programs are the same format. If your setup is like mine, Evernote is rich text, so make sure you haven't set TextEdit to plaintext. With TextEdit open, go to 'Format > Make Rich Text' (shortcut: Shift + Command + T).\nIf your setup is different then mine, then maybe Evernote is plaintext. Which would mean, if this error is still occurring, that your TextEdit is set to rich text. Use the same menu shortcut to switch it (or go to 'Format > Make Rich Text'.)\nIn either case, switching your TextEdit document will result in the table zigzagging like you mentioned. But if, going forward, you format your tables in the text mode that matches your destination's text mode, the problem should abate.\n", "Q: applescript trim number from variable Is it possible to trim a number to only keep the last 3 numbers ?\nFor exemple a phone number save in the variable, and I would like to keep the last 3 digit.\nKind regards\n\nA: Here's one way.

This solves the problem as required, i.e. giving me access to man pages for coreutils, and only then to their BSD versions, if no GNU version exists.\n", "Q: BOOTCAMP | No choice to locate ISO This is my first time ever trying to use Boot Camp Assistant.

Is there a way to keep all data backed up? It's iphone. I want all data, like save games for my infinity blade to be stored somewhere.\n\nA: I have used an iTunes backup to restore my phone on more than one occasion. I personally prefer an iTunes backup over iCloud for many reasons. The time required to complete a backup is significantly reduced with a wired connection. With iTunes you have the ability to backup any apps .ipa files. This is useful if you've ever updated an app you love and then immediately regretted the update. \nBe aware that when you backup your data with iTunes, by default every time you backup your data it overwrites the old backup with the new one.  This is not always such a good thing but you can overcome this easily with the following steps. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes and click Preferences in the menu bar \n\n*Once inside Preferences click on the section labeled devices.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Devices section you will find a list of backups for your device. \n\n*Right click on any backup listed and you should then see an option to Archive. \n\n*Select Archive for any backup you want to keep. This will prevent it from being overwritten the next time you back up your device and from any future backups. \n\n\n\nIf nothing is listed in the Devices section of Preferences, that means you don't have any saved backups for your device in iTunes and might want to go ahead and do that.\nHope this helps. \n\nA: *\n\n*iCloud backup would be the right choice as it'll backup everything as is sort of like a snapshot of your current phone, you'd want to assure that all your apps are checked on so that they're accounted in your backup.\n\n*iTunes backup would technically also backup everything but I've seen cases whereas users didn't get back all of their data.\nTake a look at Apple's documentation called About backups for iOS devices.\n", "Q: Add permanant pronunciation to text to speech dictionary Is there any way to add a permanent pronunciation to OSX text to speech dictionary?\nFor example: I would like the word 'mkdir' to be read as 'make directory' each and every time I use the \"Start Speaking\" service.\n\nA: I couldn't find a solution so I wrote an automator script that does the job: Custom Text To Speech\n", "Q: How to reset iBooks app in OS X 10.10 How can I reset the iBooks app, I mean completely reset it to the version that was installed and when first opened, where the app would show \"Welcome to iBooks\" and \"Get Started\"?\nI think I must remove a .plist file or something similar from Library, right?\n\nA: In Terminal.app (found in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder), run this command and arguments:\n/usr/bin/defaults delete ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iBooks\n\nThis will wipe the plist file, but may not trash it.\nNow when you open iBooks, the settings will be back to the default.\nThis same command will work with other apps using the appropriate arguments.\n", "Q: 2010 MacBook Pro 8 gb ram When my 2012 mbp went down with a bad ram stick, I installed Windows 8.1 on a bootcamp partition on my wife's 2010 mbp.  I got my laptop working, not longer needed to borrow hers and attempted to remove the bootcamp partition. It is gone but when ever she reboots, she has to remember to hold the option key or she automatically boots to a black screen.  I assume something didn't get properly uninstalled and its attempting to load Windows bios but it doesn't exist. Is there a way to fix this?  There is no time machine or back up pre bootcamp installation to restore to. \n\nA: I would Recommend installing windows 10 only and getting rid of the mac partition completely. There are tons of online tutorials on how to do it. BUT if you want to use the partition and have that be the default when you hit the option key to choose your startup disk, HOLD CONTROL before you select it that you’ll notice that upward-pointing arrow—the one that points to the selected disk—will change into a circular arrow instead, indicating that the chosen disk will not only be used to start your Mac this time, but that it will also become the default boot disk. \n", "Q: Overcast Podcast - how to automatically play next podcast in a playlist? The Overcast podcast app (from Marco Arment) used to play all podcasts in a playlist sequentially. Now, the player stops after each podcast.

That will give you the option to play next or stop.  \n\nA: Click on the podcast, click \"All\" in the center, and then in the top right click \"All...\" which brings up the option to \"Add # Episodes,\" and after clicking \"Add # Episodes\" the continuous play function works as expected.\n", "Q: Automator Calendar and Events Dissapears after OS X Update I have some Applescripts that I schedule to run weekdays to do various things.  I record radio programs for offline listening, I download CSV files for analysis, and do file folder cleanup.  These actions run at different times of the day.  These are scheduled in the \"Automator\" calendar as Events.\n\nFor the 4th time, I have noticed that all of my Automator events are gone and I have traced this to an OS update.  Prior to going on a short vacation, I updated OS X from 10.11.5 to 10.11.6.  When I came back, I noticed that none of the Automator actions had taken place.  Upon investigation, I found that all of the Automator Events were gone, even past ones; it was like they never existed.\nAfter some reflection, I realized that this usually happened after an OS X update.  The Automator scripts were still there, they just didn't exist in Calendar.  Strangely enough, my Exchange, and Holidays calendars with all their events were (and still are) completely intact.\nHas anyone seen behavior such as this and if so, have you found a fix/workaround?\n\nA: My solution to this was to abandon the Automaton Calendar in macOS and instead opt for using launchd.  My other option was cron but that has since been deprecated in OS X\n\nDarwin note: Although cron(8) and crontab(5) are officially supported\n  under Darwin, their functionality has been absorbed into launchd(8),\n  which provides a more flexible way of automatically executing\n  commands. See launchctl(1) for more information.”\n\nI have created and backed up all of the .plists that I need running on my machine and created a bash script that installs all of them in case I need to do a clean install of macOS in the future.\nFull documentation on lauchd can be found on Apple's Developer Website\n", "Q: Personal Hotspot question So I have an iPhone that's connected to wifi. I forgot the Wifi password and want to connect a device to my phones personal hotspot, does it cost extra money if I do?\n\nA: That depends on your service provider. In the US if you use T-mobile with an unlimited plan the answer would be no.\nIf you pay for data the answer would be yes. The hotspot on your phone is set up to use your mobile data.\nOne way or another, you pay for tethered data based on what service provider you choose and what plan you choose. \n\nA: Unless you use USB-Tethering for the connection between your iPhone and the other device, there is no way to start your mobile hotspot as long as you are connected to the WiFi. If you try to, your phone will automatically disconnect from the WiFi.\nThat is because your phone has only one WiFi card/module on the hardware side, and thus can only manage one WiFi network at a time.\nWhen you connect your phone to a stationary WiFi network, you configure the WiFi module to be the receiving end of the connection (although it of course also sends data).\nWhen you start the hotspot, your phone configures the WiFi module to be the broadcasting end of a WiFi network (although it of course also receives data), exactly like your normal WiFi router at home is, just with a weaker signal.\nThese two modes cannot operate at the same time.\n", "Q: External monitor blurry When I connect my Macbook Pro 13\" 2015 to an external monitor, the quality is horrible.

Also, the contact won't get a notification that the call or message was blocked.\nI'm inferring from the wording ...the contact won't get a notification... that only a phone call/message from a number in your Contacts will not see a 'blocked call' response.\nOne solution is to add these phone numbers into your Contacts.

The FAQ page for the Public Beta Program includes the following entry:\n\nIs the public beta software confidential?\nYes, the public beta software is Apple confidential information. Don’t install the public beta software on any systems you don't directly control or that you share with others. Don’t blog, post screen shots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software, and don't discuss the public beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the Apple Beta Software Program. If Apple has publicly disclosed technical information about the public beta software, it is no longer considered confidential.\n\nWhy is it considered confidential if it is completely free to enrol in the beta program and anyone with an Apple ID can do it? Is there some kind of weird legal issue or is Apple just reusing some parts of their TOS from other things?\n\nA: One reason beta software is restricted and considered confidential is that by exposing features could result in revenue recognition issues for the company, which could result in the company refunding money or needing to restate their corporate financials.\nLets say you play with the beta, and are extremely excited to discover that this beta has support for left-handed keyboards. As a big user of left-handed keyboards, you begin tweeting about the support, write blog posts, etc.  Many users decide to purchase new Macs because they too are anticipating left-handed keyboards. However, Apple decides that supporting left-handed keyboards doesn't work well enough, and decide to not ship the support in the golden master release. Customers sue Apple, demanding not only refunds but reparations for lost time because of the \"missing\" support. The SEC investigates Apple, because they feel Apple may have mislead investors, who anticipated that there would be lots of sales of Macs, partly due to left hand keyboard support....\nYou get the idea.\n", "Q: Photoshop—\"scratch disk is full\" error Using a Macbook Air, I have 60Gb free space on my hard drive, yet I can't crop an image (W x H, Resolution setting) because \"the scratch disks are full\".\nWhat does the error mean? How do I fix it? I can't imagine Photoshop's doing an operation that requires more than 60Gb of spare disk space...\n\nA: I found this guide here with a simple Google Search. \nIf you are getting a \"scratch disk full\" error when attempting to crop an image, you probably have accidentally entered the size and resolution values in the options bar for the crop tool. You could have also possibly entered the values in the wrong units. This can cause massive render issues as it will try to generate an incredibly large file, ultimately causing the error. The solution to this issue is to press clear in the options bar after selecting the crop tool, but before you drag a crop selection.\n", "Q: How to remove people from search in mail app?

I know that this is a fairly common problem, but I've never had it before: if a pdf is displayed in a Safari window, clicking the download icon in the overlay in the bottom middle of the window doesn't do anything. I know that a common cause is the presence of an AdobePDFviewer plugin, but it isn't installed and Preview is my default app for reading PDFs. I know that I can do a \"Save As,\" but I'd like to regain this functionality.\nI've tried various other remedies, to no avail.\n\nA: The problem appeared to be that Safari didn't support downloading the PDF from the popup provided by the website (in my case 1Password with its Emergency Kit PDF). Instead I had to use CMD + S or use the File menu in the Menu Bar to save the PDF.\n1Password informed me \"That is expected behavior — Safari doesn't fully support downloading the PDF from the popup we provide.\" One is supposed to press command-S or \"File > Save As\" when I reached out to them.\n", "Q: Applescript to automate process for screen cast setup I'm currently looking for an Applescript to help automate my desktop processes, as I do a lot of screencasts and I'm looking for something that would do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*hide the dock\n\n*hide the top bar\n\n*change the wallpaper to a specified wallpaper\n\n\nis there a place on the web that has automator scripts that would do something like this ?\n\nA: You didn't say what version of OS X you're using, although I'm assuming it's OS X El Capitan, which is what this was tested under. This is kind of a kludge but it works nonetheless. Using Script Editor and the AppleScript code below, I made an AppleScript application that toggles the state of hiding/unhiding the Dock and Menu bar, as well as changing the wallpaper between the two states.\nHere's where the kludge comes in. Because there is not one explicit way, that I know of, to code the script to do everything in the background as easily as toggling the state of the auto hide preference of the Dock and changing the wallpaper, a mix of methods needs to be used. One of which requires giving the application assistive access rights to perform the toggling of the \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" checkbox in the General section of System Preferences.\nIt'd be nice if something like tell menu preferences to set autohide to not autohide would work the same way it does for the Dock, but it doesn't and why using a UI programmatic method is required to toggle the state of the Menu bar.\nOtherwise this could all be done in the background and not having to give the application permission to manipulate the UI. (There actually is a way, however it's not as clean as this way is, in that it requires programmatically killing Finder for the change to the global preferences .plist file to toggle the state of the menu bar to take effect. So I prefer this method as the changes appear more gracefully made, then... bam... done and now wondering what the heck just happened.)\nNote: As coded I'm making the assumption that the state of both the Dock and the Menu bar are in sync. In other words, they are both always either showing or hidden together under normal usage and as such this script toggles the state of each to the opposite of the current state prior to its execution. If that is not the case, then additional logic needs to be applied.\n\nIn this example code, the wallpaper is set between the OS X El Capitan default and another in its Desktop Pictures collection. Obviously you can choose whatever you want for each state.\nThe only code you should have to change is the pathname of the image files being used for the Desktop wallpaper.\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    reveal pane id \"com.apple.preference.general\"\n    delay 1\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    click checkbox \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar\" of window \"General\" of process \"System Preferences\"\n    key code 12 using command down\n    tell dock preferences to set autohide to not autohide\n    if (get autohide of dock preferences) is false then\n        set picture of desktop 1 to POSIX file \"/Library/Desktop Pictures/El Capitan.jpg\"\n    else\n        set picture of desktop 1 to POSIX file \"/Library/Desktop Pictures/Desert.jpg\"\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nTo use this code, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Script Editor.\n\n*Copy and paste the code from the Browser to Script Editor.\n\n*Edit the pathnames of the images to be used for the wallpaper.\n\n*Save the script as an Application.\n\n*Open a Finder window to the location you saved the application. (This it to facilitate giving it assistive access in the next instructions.)\n\n*Open System Preferences and navigate to: Security & Privacy > Accessibility > Privacy\n\n*Click the lock to make changes.\n\n*Provide proper credentials and click Unlock.\n\n*Drag and drop the application from Finder into the \"Allow the apps below to control your computer.\" window and then check the checkbox next to the application's name.\n\n\n*\n\n*Or if you didn't first locate it in Finder, click the [+] button and navigate to the location you saved the app, etc.\n\n\n*Close System Preferences.\nThat's it...

As of iOS9 Apple stopped allowing iTunes or any other application to backup apps to IPA files. When it comes time to do a restore, one must download all apps. This can either be done to iTunes or on the iOS device itself. The reason is because in iOS9 apps are \"thinned\" so that data only necessary for an iPad does not waste storage space on an iPhone.\nTools like iTools and iMazing and CopyTrans used to offer the functionality to backup apps to IPA, but have not added support for iOS9.\nTo question, how to backup apps to IPA so that they can be restored without downloading them again?\n\nA: If you are jailbroken, there is a solution that can be batch scripted. \nInstall sbutils and ipainstaller from cydia \nssh to phone and run these commands:\nsbbundleids > backup.txt\nwhile read line; do\nipainstaller -b $line\ndone < backup.txt\nand then to install the apps:\nipainstaller *.ipa\nI tested a few and it allows to upgrade apps directly from app store without fuss.

This requires you to install a tool which is not part of the default command set. \nDownload and install exiftool. \nexiftool is able to print detailed information about image files, including TIFFs. It can tell the difference between multi-page documents and between FAXes and photographic TIFFs.

I want to see the sender's name on the lock screen, not the Contact name. \n\nA: The simplest way is to not have that person in your contacts or have their Whatsapp name in contacts. You can't have them both in your contacts and also just display the regular Whatsapp username as far as I know.\n", "Q: Transfering PDFs to ipad on windows?

I found that I could install it by brew using brew install e2fsprogs\nTthis returned the following: \nThis formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.\n\nThis brew installs several commands which override OS X-provided file system commands.\n\nGenerally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your\nown software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your\nbuild variables:\n\n    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/lib\n    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/include\n\n==> Summary\n  /usr/local/Cellar/e2fsprogs/1.42.13: 135 files, 5.0M\n\nSo i tried using brew link e2fsprogs which then returned 119 symlinks created\nBut the command mke2fs is still not available. Anyone who can throw me a bone here?\n\nA: Usually brew executables (except brew itself) are linked to /usr/local/bin/ which is in the PATH already.\nSince e2fsprogs executables are also installed to a subsequent sbin folder, force linking them with brew ln --force e2fsprogs will create a new folder /usr/local/sbin which contains the links to the sbins.\nThis new folder is not in the PATH. Simply add or extend an already existing  line \nexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\n\nin ~/.bash_profile.\nTo update PATH in your current Terminal session immediately, simply enter:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\nOr close your Terminal window and open a new one.\n", "Q: Hard drive for Fusion drive: 7200 vs 5400 I have a Mac Mini 2012 with 128 GB SSD on board.

You can do this  by adding a counter and checking the counter against a predetermined value that will force condition that stops the loop to become true.\nFor example, we set a limit that the loop will run 10 times:\nset count to 0\n\nrepeat until (stopString = \"stop\")\n\n    ...\n\n\n    if count > 10 then\n        set stopString to \"stop\"\n    end if\n\n    set count to count + 1\n\nend repeat\n\n\nA: I am now having Screen output to log.txt, and the following applescript works just great!\nset trigger to 1\nset stopString to \"\"\nrepeat until (stopString = \"stop\")\nset testTxt to paragraphs of (read POSIX file \"/Users/fed/log.txt\")\nset countTxt to (count of testTxt) - 1\nset lastLine to item countTxt of testTxt    \nif lastLine contains \"Start MP3\" and trigger is 1 then\n    tell application \"Spotify\" to playpause\n    set trigger to 0\nend if\n\nif lastLine does not contain \"Start MP3\" then\n    set trigger to 1\nend if\n\nif lastLine contains \"Stop Loop\" then\n    set stopString to \"stop\"\nend if\n\nend repeat\n", "Q: How can I make phone calls on the internet IPhone 6 I have a remote location were I have only satellite service, no cell service.\nWhen I first purchased my iPhone 6 to my surprise I received messages (voice) left on phone at this location.

I am still getting text messages, which I also did with my iPhone 4S. \nDid an update wipe out this ability or have I turned something off by mistake? I have all of my data turned on to WiFi.\n\nA: Sounds like you want to enable Wifi Calling on your device. Turn on Wi-Fi calling in Settings > Phone > Wi-Fi Calling. For more, check out the Apple page on Wifi Calling.\n\nA: If you want a cross-platform solution (in case you don't want to become more tied down to iOS), there are numerous VOIP solutions. With Skype, for example, you can purchase a phone number for a pretty reasonable price. (Or just use Skype-to-Skype for free.)

And has there been a way to defeat it? Or is there an actual hardware reason as far as anyone knows?\nThanks!\n\nA: Though the Mac Pro 4,1 won't run Sierra, the Mac Pro 5,1 will.\nApparently, the Sierra installer only looks for the 5,1 firmware, not the 2009 tag.\nThe thing about the 4,1 & 5,1 is they are so similar, it's possible to turn one into the other with a simple firmware update.\nI have never personally done this, mine was bought already upgraded. The original hack is at http://forum.netkas.org/index.php/topic,852.msg5004.html#msg5004 Which links to a user-made utility to allow this to be changed in both directions, 4,1 to 5,1 & back again. It apparently uses the official Apple Firmware updater as part of the process.\nYou can pre-empt the download by fetching the 5,1 firmware first, directly from Apple\nThere are 69 pages of comments... which, honestly,  I haven't read.

How do I do this? I see all kinds of instructions online that say how to make a boot disk that installs El Capitan. I just want to start my computer from an external disk -- I am not trying to do a clean install. Is the procedure the same? Will the bootable install disk just startup as normal if I tell it I don't want to reinstall the system somehow? \nIt's just that all the instructions seem to assume you want to do a clean install, and that isn't what I am after.\n\nA: TechTool Pro allows you to create a so-called eDrive. You will find the feature in the GUI choosing Tools > eDrive. You need an external drive (either an external HDD/SSD or a thumb drive). About 15.5 GB of the disk will be reserved to create a new volume \"eDrive\".\nAfter choosing your system volume as source and a volume on the external disk as destination drive, the external volume will be resized and a new volume eDrive  will be created. All necessary files and folders will be copied to eDrive after starting the task.\n\nNow quit TechTool Pro, open System Preferences > Startup Disk, choose eDrive as boot volume and reboot your Mac.\nYour Mac boots from the eDrive and TechTool Pro will be opened and you are free to diagnose your main volume.\n\nSince only about 5.5 GB of the 15.5 GB are used you may install additional tools.\n\nA: When it boots, you do get the install option first but I'm pretty sure there is still the finder bar at the top with menu items. \nOne of them has the disk utility in it which you can run right from there.

Everytime I connect to the Cisco VPN using the built-in VPN client, it asks me for the password. I am wondering is there a way we can auto save the password, like using the keychain?\n\nA: This looks like a very annoying and longstanding bug in Mac OS X/macOS.\n10.6: Save Cisco IPSec password in the Keychain:\n\nMac OS X Snow Leopard added the support for Cisco IPSec VPN\nconnections – that is, plain IPSec with XAuth authentication and\nmode_cfg.\nThat makes it two layers of authentication: first, Machine\nAuthentication with a password (Shared Secret) or an X509 certificate.\nThen a traditional username-password pair for XAuth, both of which you\ncan enter and save in the Account Name and Password fields\nrespectively when you set up the connection. Trouble is, even though\nyou entered your password and it is apparently saved in the keychain\nproperly, Mac OS X keeps nagging you to manually enter the password\nevery time you connect. Turns out this is a just bug with a simple\nfix.\nOpen the Keychain Access Application, select the System keychain and\nfind your saved XAuth password entry in the list. Its Kind field will\nsay IPSec XAuth Password. Open it, then on the Access Control tab\nclick the Plus button to add another application. The file we need to\nselect, /usr/libexec/configd, resides in a hidden folder. To navigate\nthere, press Command+Shift+G, enter /usr/libexec, then pick configd in\nthe dialog. Save your changes and that's it – your saved password\nshould now work.\n\nAnother guide using pretty pictures:\nhttps://anders.com/guides/native-cisco-vpn-on-mac-os-x/\nApparently the same manual fix of adding configd to the Keychain-allowed applications has to be applied for using the built-in ipsec-vpn tools.\nVPN ipsec Prompting Saved Password:\n\nSymptoms:\nOn Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.x) you are prompted to enter your VPN\npassword even though you’ve previously saved it in the keychain You\nare using IPSec on the built in VPN client on Mac OS X Snow Leopard\nExplanation:\nThis is caused by a problem with the Keychain Access item for the VPN IPSec   connection.  A two minute fix will sort it out\nfor you.\nSolution:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Keychain Access by clicking Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access\n\n*On the left upper pane, under Keychains select System\n\n*On the left lower, under Category select All Items\n\n*On the right side of the screen scroll to the bottom and locate the two items called VPN(IPSec)\n\n*Double-click the VPN(IPSec) whos kind is IPSec XAuth Password\n\n*Click the Access Control button/tab.  The applications permitted to use this keychain item will be displayed below.  If you’re prompted\nfor your password, enter it.\n\n*Click the plus (+) sign\n\n*When the Finder window appears, press Cmd + Shift + G on your keyboard\n\n*When the Go To Folder dialog appears, enter /usr/libexec\n\n*Click Go\n\n*When the /usr/libexec folder appears scroll to configd, select it and click Add\n\n*Click Save Changes\n\n*Close Keychain Access and try connecting to your VPN again\n\n\n\nA: I found a neat workaround with AnyConnect CLI and Keychain.\nThe idea is to store my AnyConnect credential in Keychain, and use the AnyConnect's command line interface to access my saved credential and connect to VPN. It even works well with two factor authorization.\nSay I want to connect to foo.bar.com with account acc and password pas.\n\n*\n\n*Save acc and pas pair in Keychain (under login not iCloud) with name fookey\n\n*Run the following bash script to connect (save it in /usr/local/bin)\n\n/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect foo.bar.com -s << EOM\n0    # foo.bar.com doesn't require two factor authorization\nacc  # vpn account\n$(sudo security find-generic-password -ws fookey)  # look up [pas] from keychain\nEOM\n\nUsing this approach, I don't need to type in my vpn password every time, and I won't write my password to files without encryption :)\n\nIf you are not familiar with bash script:\n\n*\n\n*/opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect -s enters non-interactivel mode.\n\n*<< EOM ... EOM is called here-docs, which uses a string to replace a file. It is very useful to script interactive CLI, by writing each respond as a new line.\n\n*security is a nice tool to access your Keychain from the command line.\n\n", "Q: Xamarin Android Player runs slowly on MacBook Air 2015 I've a need to virtualise an Android device on my MacBook Air. I've successfully installed the Xamarin Android Player and downloaded Nexus 7 Marshmallow image. The emulation starts correctly, but it is very slow. \nFrom what I've found from the internet is that this could be a disabled virtualisation issue or outdated firmware. I'm running the latest version of El Captain - 10.11.6, so I think this couldn't be an outdated firmware issue.\nThere is no (very hard to find) clear walkthrough on how it is possible to enable virtualisation on MacBook Air early 2015.\nI know that there are alternatives to Xamarin Android Player, like Visual Studio, but I'm really short on SSD space - 128GB. That's the main reason why I don't want to install Visual Studio with many features what I have no need to use.\nPlease share your thoughts on what issue could slow down the performance of Android emulator and what would be the optimal way to solve such issue.\n\nA: I've got tired of searching and waiting for someone's help and approached Xamarin themselves about this issue. Turns out that this product is no longer supported (see link to the official Xamarin statement) and they advise to use other emulators rather than their (what sounds a bit strange for me at least). So following the advise of Xamarin support service I have downloaded Genymotion Android emulator for personal use (as it is free).\nAfter downloading you might want to tweak certain things for emulator to run a bit faster. Genymotion works on top of VirtualBox (it installs it on the background so no need to install it separately)\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch from Legacy Paravirtualization Interface to Hyper-V (Settings->System->Acceleration)\n\n*Enable 3D Acceleration in Settings->Display->Acceleration\n\n*VirtualBox will constanly complain that there is more cores used than there is available on the computer (4, when my MacBook Air has only 2). But, if you change this value to 2 the performance of emulator will be much more slower. No idea why.\n\n*Make sure that you have Intel HAXM drivers otherwise don't expect the emulator to work at its full speed.\n\n\nEverything mentioned here fairly experimental, so any if you have any relevant in this field, please share it. \n", "Q: Remote control and screenviewing on OS X? So I have a company Macbook and a co-worker recently told me that it can be controlled or viewed any moment.\nNot that I do something illegal on it, I value my privacy and this piqued my interest so I wanted to know if this is indeed possible and how.\nWhat I figured so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Internet provider can easily see my outbound and inbound traffic so this is out of the question. As long as I'm in the office my traffic can be viewed.\n\n*There's a bunch of options in the Sharing setting in System Preferences that allows remote login, access and screen viewing.\n\n*There's an ESET Remote Administrator Agent running on my Mac.\n\n*My Firewall is currently disabled.\nAs far as I understand, if I disable all options in point 2, I should be fine, right? Do I need to be concerned about ESET RAA or the disabled Firewall?\n\nA: *\n\n*This isn't exactly true. They can see the sites you visit but not what the content is if you're using HTTPS. This means that they can see you're checking your balance but not what your balance is.\nThis also applies to company network traffic providing they're not doing MITM which they can't do without inserting their own certificate on your computer. I suggest checking the certificates installed on your machine in Keychain Access to see if there's a certificate installed.\n\n*You can disable these to disable the relevant services from being accessed through the methods detailed in the information shown by clicking on each service. Disabling these won't prevent against third-party software installed on the machine providing similar functionality.\n\n*Any third-party software could provide functionality such as remote access. I'm unfamiliar with this specific software but it may be a good idea to research exactly what specific software installed on your machine can do.\n\n*You can re-enable the firewall, however be careful that this does not block any legitimate traffic that may be required by your work network.\n", "Q: How to add image/mount/disk back to the sidebar?

I've fixed mine with Sugru, any silicone putty would work. I've seen quite some people use gaffer tape and the like. There's also specialised shrink sleeve products to fix it.\nAfter the plastic breaks and no fixes are applied, the inner cable might start to fray and eventually also fail.\n\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro 2013 connect to projector with resolution bigger then laptop screen I want to connect my projector to my Mac Book pro. Projector has resolution 1920x1080 Full HD. My question is how to output the same resolution from MacBook. My Mac Book pro display has resolution 1280x800, I am not sure if I can make output 1920x1080.\n\nA: According to everymac.com, your particular MacBook Pro will display 2560x1600 maximum resolution (Thunderbolt) and 1920x1200 via HDMI.\n\nIf your projector supports 1920x1080, and it being \"Full HD\" as you described, it will most likey have an HDMI port.

How can I remove the bars? \n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Air 13\" (Early 2015)\n\n*LG Flatron E2360\n\n*Dell Thunderbolt to VGA Adapter.\n\n\nA: The vertical black bars appear when the MacBook screen resolution and the external display screen resolution is not in the same ratio. \nTo fix that, when you connect to the screen, there is a prompt to choose which screen resolution you want to use. It’s either MacBook or the external display. This is how vanilla MacOS works. \nOr, go Apple Menu --> System Preferences -->  \"Displays\" pane  set your preferred monitor resolutions there.\n\nA: I had this exact issue with a Thunderbolt to VGA adapter and an Acer display on my MBP.  It was showing up as a projector, not a monitor, with black bars and low resolution. I simply plugged it into the other Thunderbolt and MBP recognized it as a 720p display. \nMaybe also try updating OS X with adapter plugged in (this may force MBA to download a driver). Or downloading driver from manufacturer website. I would verify that the cables are properly connected too. \n\nA: Plug and play again helps.

I'm currently using \"El Capitan\" version 10.11.6\nI have the Windows 10 Enterprise 64bits installer ISO.  I have doubts about Installing Windows on SDXC Card using Boot Camp.\nIs it Possible to do this and if so, is there a step-by-step or HOWTO available?\nEDIT 1\nMy Hard Disk is 128GB, I really need another partitions for CentOS and Windows 10 then Is very few space for three OS.\nAnd now I know the speed is very slow for SDXC (I was thinking in Transcend).\nIf I found a Speedest Hard Disk the USB speed will be a limitation.\nSome clue to solve this limitation Space and Speed?\n\nA: Can you do this?\nWith Windows?  No.  Technically, it's possible to boot an OS (like Linux for FreeBSD) off a SD card - you simply point your bootloader to the bootable partition of the SDXC card and away you go  But...\nWhy would you want to do this?  It would be horribly slow. \n(and by slow, I mean slow as molasses in winter slow)\nMicrosoft doesn't like people booting from removable drives and since the SD card reader is off your USB bus, it shows up as a removable device.  Linux doesn't have this limitation, however.  \nThis doesn't, however, prevent you from putting a virtual HDD on the SD card and booting Windows in a virtualized environment like Parallels or VirtualBox.\nWhy you don't want to do this\nYour SATA drive on your Mac transfers at 6Gb/s.  A USB 3.0 drive goes 5Gb/s.  Your SD card (assuming class 10) will go at most .5Gb/s (yes, only half a gigabit per second).  \n*Basically,  you will be trying to install Windows on a disk that's 12x slower than the drive built in to your Mac. And that's at the highest speed possible that an SD card can go.\nI give more detail in an answer here\nBy trying to boot off the SDXC card, you would bring your MBP down to a crawl; to the point it would be torturous to us.  The best thing to do is to keep that SDXC card for pictures, or whatever file storage you need.\n", "Q: Folder that automatically creates aliases I like to save inspirational imagery in my dock. Since my Downloads folder is always a giant pile of files that I hoard and enjoy to go through every once in a while. \nNow to save space in my Dock I’d have to have a folder as a stack where all those aliases to inspirational files are stored in. It would be nifty to be able to drag files into that folder and have the folder automatically create an alias of the file instead of moving it to there. That way I wouldn’t have to use shortcuts etc. and could simply drag files into there without actually moving them.\nUnderstood? Maybe someone knows a solution. I’m guessing an AppleScript would be required. Let’s work together on this to make it happen.\n\nA: Simply create a folder action script, move the scpt file to /Users/user_name/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts and apply it to a folder:\nThe content of the script is:\non adding folder items to thefolder after receiving theAddedItems\n    repeat with eachfile in theAddedItems\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            make new alias file to eachfile at folder \"Main_Volume_Name:Users:user_name:Desktop:Inspirational:\"\n        end tell\n    end repeat\n    repeat with eachfile in theAddedItems\n        tell application \"Finder\"\n            move eachfile to folder \"Main_Volume_Name:Users:user_name:Downloads:\"\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\nWith Main_Volume_Name: the name of your volume (e.g. Macintosh HD – you don't have to escape spaces!) and user_name: your short user name.\nSave the scpt to /Users/user_name/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/ with the name \"alias - add alias instead of moving files.scpt\".\nNow create a folder \"Inspirational\" on your desktop and a folder \"intermediate\" somewhere else.\nRight-click the folder \"intermediate\" and attach the above script to the folder:\n\nDrag both folders to the dock. You may apply convincing icons to be able to tell which is which.  If the folder action is activated, applying an icon to the \"intermediate\" folder will already create a file named _icon alias (or similar) in \"Inspirational\" folder. Please delete this file. In the example below the rose indicates the \"Inspirational\" folder and the chalkboard the  \"intermediate\" folder\nTo create (an) alias(es) in the folder \"Inspirational\" drag one or several files and/or folders on the \"intermediate\" folder:\n\nThe aliases will be created in the folder \"Inspirational\" and the dragged files will be moved back to \"Downloads\":\n\n\nYou can't use only one folder, because this will invoke an endless loop: as soon as a new alias is created by adding a file to the folder action enabled folder, the new alias will be aliased itself too (because it's another \"new\" file).

The hard drive is only 120 GB, but the \"other\" category in the About this Mac storage option is taking up over 81 GB. I've tried following a number of turorials online including cleaning up mail cache, downloads, browser cache, etc. to little avail.\nMy question is, is this expected? I feel like 81 GB for other storage is a bit excessive, but I can't find any files large enough to indicate this should be an issue (including browsing almost her entire user directory and looking at folder sizes).\nAnything you could offer would help.\n\nA: Other storage could refer to anything that OS X doesn't recognize as one of the storage categories (music, videos...) In order to find the source of the files, I would recommend checking the size of folders to determine where large files are. In order to see the size of a folder, right click it and click \"get info\".

I have tried safe mode, resetting PRAM and SMC, recovery mode, everything I know of. Upon pressing the power button, the computer immediately turns on and chimes like normal, then goes to the white screen with the apple and a progress bar. After 5-10 minutes, it asks me to select a language, and then proceeds to OS X Utilities. I tried repairing the hard drive in Disk Utility with first aid, but it says it can't complete the repair. I tried erasing the hard drive (I have a recent backup), but it always tells me \"Erase process failed.\" I tried restoring from Time Machine Backup, and although it found my backups on an external hard drive, it doesn't seem to recognize them.\nNow here is what seems to have triggered the issue: I had just downloaded OS X Capitan and was attempting to install it, but the installation failed after the part where the computer restarts. When I go to Disk Utility I see Capitan there, but as with my hard drive, I can't erase it and neither can I eject it. When I go to \"Reinstall OS X\" it launches right into the Capitan installation, not the OS X 10.6 installation CD which is in the drive. Soon into the installation process, after it asks to verify my information with apple, a message pops up: \"An error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again.\" That's as far as I can get, and to clarify, I haven't been able to get beyond OS X Utilities at all.\nI have another fresh hard drive that I could swap, but when I did swap it and then turned the computer on, it just goes to the apple and the spinning circle and stays there forever.\nYesterday I also exchanged the RAM and the battery, but I put the old ones back in and it still behaves the same so  I don't see how that could be the issue.\nI'm nearing my wit's end as it seems I've tried the few options available at this point, and I would be grateful it anyone has any suggestions or hypotheses as to what's going on and how I could go about fixing it.\nEDIT (in response to Daniel): I tried starting up from the DVD installer by holding C down -- it just goes to the apple, the spinning wheel, and after a while ends up on a blank white screen. I've left it going like this for several hours so I'm pretty sure it's not just a matter of waiting. This is what it does every time, even when I startup pressing \"option\" and then choose the OS X install disk. Interestingly, when I startup with \"option,\" my hard drive is labeled \"OS X Install Disk,\" I guess because it is still in the process of trying to install Capitan.\nWhen I put in my spare, clean hard drive, it actually does boot up from the install disk. However, when it comes time for me to choose where to install OS X, the computer recognizes the hard drive but says I can't install it there (no reason given).\nDoes all this suggest there is a problem with the hardware on the computer?\n\nA: \nI tried repairing the hard drive in Disk Utility with first aid, but it says it can't complete the repair\n\nUpon this kind of error, the first thing to understand is that you can't\nachieve anything of any value with your internal disk as long as it is\nin this unusable state.\nThis explains fully that your Mac is automatically trying a recovery.\nGet (or make) a bootable USB key or DVD installer (they should be safe and obviously not built with your unsafe MacBook Pro).\nBoot from it.\nStart Utilities, Disk Utility and try to repair your internal disk\nfrom a safe version of Disk Utility.\nIf you succeed,\nthen install a clean version of the version of MacOS X you can install\nfrom an external safe medium (USB key or DVD installer),\nelse replace your internal disk.\n", "Q: iPad Air sold online as new: how can I be certain? I purchased an iPad Air 1, online from a reputable \"group discount\" website. Though the site sells certified refurbished and used Apple products, this product clearly stated \"brand new\". It arrived in the shrink wrapped Apple box and once opened,looked legitimately packaged new. I'm skeptible by nature, however felt questionable when noticed there was no manual or earbuds included. There was a new Apple charger in the box. Additionally,it arrived 100 % charged. (?) I recall having to charge every wireless purchase ever made!\n  I'm not technically challenged, familiar to older iPads,and have purchased many Apple products in the past. However, they have always included an Apple manual,ear buds and it required to be fully charged. I had no problem registering the pad or assigning a password,however I want to be certain what I purchased is as advertised; Brand new and in perfect working condition. The product has a 30 day, no question, return policy and a one year Apple warrantee. Can anyone confirm how their iPad air appeared apon opening, what was included, did it require charging, and how can I scan it for prior use or refurburshing? \n\nA: My iPad Air did not include earbuds - I don't think any iPad model has even included earbuds. \nAs far as I can remember, every iPad I have bought from Apple has been received ready to turn on. If not 100% charged, then 80% charged or similar. \niPads do not come with a big manual at all. There's a little booklet with a few \"cards\" that explain the buttons on the iPad - that's really all.\nSo all in all, none of those observations should lead you to conclude that your iPad was not new when you purchased it.\nTo be sure, I would go to the Apple Support site and check your warranty status with your serial number.\n", "Q: Problems with creating Open Directory Replica on OS X Server 5.1 Background:\nTwo Macs which are running the same Operation System: Mac OS X 10.11.6, OS X Server 5.1.\nWhen I try to set up the second Mac as a replica server, it always shows an error as the following picture:\n\nThen I tried to enter the following command in Terminal from the intended replica server:\nsudo /usr/sbin/slapconfig -preflightreplica 192.168.8.107 <directoryadminuser>  \n\nI always get this error message:\n\n2016-08-13 07:20:58 +0000 NSMutableDictionary *_getRootDSE(const char *): rootDSE not found\n  2016-08-13 07:20:58 +0000 Error: Unable to determine the master's software version.\n\nBoth servers are set to be allowed to remote login via ssh as administrators.\nGetting the version returns: \n$:sudo slapconfig -ver\nLDAP Setup Tool (slapconfig), Apple, Inc.,  Version 10.11\n\nAnd I tried all the methods from these addresses, but none of them worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Resolve “rootDSE not found” Error in Open Directory\n\n*Cannot successfully preflight OD replica\n\n*Problems creating open directory replica on Yosemite Server.\nAnyone can share some advices with me? Really appreciated.\n\nA: Note that although I got the same error, I am on macOS 10.12.6 and Server 5.3.1.\nI documented what I did, step-by-step.  I'm not exactly sure which of these steps made the difference but my hope is that this will help someone.\nIn my case I have a server on the west-coast and another on the east-coast using a site-to-site VPN and two different /24 IP subnets, so communication can happen but replication obviously failed.  Before starting I recommend having the same macOS version/build numbers as well as the same server.app version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Blow away OD on both sides.  I used $ sudo slapconfig -destroyldapserver.  Make sure to have a backup of your data first.\n\n*Get DNS working perfectly.  This involved going through Server.app's \"edit hostname\" process and (in my case) using a FQDN.  When you change the hostname and you're asked to select whether the server is operating on LAN-only, LAN + VPN, or Internet, select either the LAN + VPN or Internet options.  This is so that the server creates DNS zones that aren't \".local\", which I think is one of the core issues that prevented replication working, because .local is for Bonjour and I think that messes things up.\nSo I changed the computer name to \"Company X Vancouver Server\" and the hostname to vanserv.clientcompany.com.  Restarted the server, checked things out with $ changeip -checkhostname and verified forwards and backwards DNS are working with the \"host\" tool, looking up both the IP and the hostname, and making sure it resolved both ways.  Set the server to use 127.0.0.1 for DNS first, then its other IP (192.168.10.10), then local next-hop router, then public DNS.  Restart.\nI did exactly the same thing on the east-coast server, calling it \"Company X Toronto Server\", and hostname \"torserv.clientcompany.com\".\nI made sure there were entries on both servers for the other server.  So vanserv has vanserv.clientcompany.com (192.168.10.10) and torserv.clientcompany.com (192.168.20.10).  Checked forward- and reverse- DNS lookups for the other server on both.  And pinging torserv from vanserv would resolve and return packets, and vice-versa.\nI set both servers to \"perform lookups for only some clients\" - and I set that to the server itself, only.  This is so that DNS lookups for the company's domain, clientcompany.com, don't go to the server and fail to resolve, such as a staff member at the office visiting the company's website.\n\n*Create the primary OD, but leave it empty.  Restart.  Join the replica to it using the FQDN - in this case the OD was created on vanserv and I joined torserv to it as a replica.  I used the FQDN vanserv.clientcompany.com instead of the IP address.  Success!\n\n*Populate the OD with data, make sure it replicates successfully.  It did!\n\n*Add in locales (optional) - I defined 192.168.20.0 as Toronto and set that server to torserv.clientcompany.com, and Vancouver as 192.168.10.0/24 and set that server to vanserv.clientcompany.com.\nSo my suspicion is that the \"network problem\" as well as the \"different version of macOS\" errors I was getting in the server.app GUI really were just a lack of good communication happening due to DNS being configured in a way that server.app didn't like.\n\nA: Yes - this worked for me on Sierra with a brand new directory. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204880\n", "Q: USB external hard drive is mounted on one MacBook Pro but not another I have a Hitachi rpm-5400 160GB hard drive in an Orico USB 3.0 hard drive case.

Where should I go next to fix this problem? I don't want to erase the drive because it have important informations on it and it takes very long time to copy it to another drive.\nThanks\n\nA: My intuition would say that the drive might be drawing a little more power than the USB spec allows and one Mac can supply that power and the other cannot, but that's just speculation.\nYou would need to measure the voltage or try a different drive in the same enclosure with the same two Mac to start to pick apart why you get different results on two hardware setup.\n", "Q: Upgrading Memory, HD, and Processor on a MacBook2,1 I recently got a MacBook2,1 as a gift and I'm looking to upgrade the memory, hd, and processor. Currently it is a MacBook2,1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz processor, 2GB of RAM, and about 200GB of HD space. Oh yeah, and the battery's dead so it only works when it is plugged in. I read somewhere you can add an extra 2GB of memory to this bad boy. However, only 3GB is usable due to some I/O settings.\nWhat's the best way to gauge performance of this machine so that I can choose an upgrade on a budget?\n\nA: One of the best reference sites out there is EveryMac.com  They have a very reliable and comprehensive list of pretty much every Mac product ever made.\nYou should take some time to review and become familiar with the specs of your machine.\nThat said...\nYou aren't going to get a very modern OS X experience out of this machine.\n\n*\n\n*The latest OS X version that's compatible is 10.7 (Lion)\n\n*Max RAM is 3.5GB\n\n*HDD is SATA I (1.5 Gb/sec)\n\nNo matter how you slice it, it's not a strong platform to begin with.\nHowever...\nAll is not lost.  It's still a good laptop to be used for surfing the web, checking email and even doing some office type work.\n\n*\n\n*4GB of memory is cheap (2x2GB PC2-5300])\n\n*A New battery is around $50 on (don't ever buy used batteries, it's not worth it)\n\n*A SATA SSD can be had for as little as $45-50 on and even cheaper on eBay used.\n\nWith these few upgrades, you can install Windows 7 32bit (potentially Win10, but I haven't tried it), Ubuntu, or my personal favorite FreeBSD (you will probably have better results with *BSD since OS X is based on the BSD OS).  In fact, if you are looking for a machine in which you can learn one of the *NIXes, this is a great way to do it.\nBottom line...\nIf you are looking to keep it in the Apple family, just be aware of the limitations on it.

AE\nNote: when I connected the AE to TC the 1st time, this diagram was shown in the Airport Utility:\nInternet > TC > AE\nbut it would still drops, after resetting the AE several times and tried to configure it multiple times, now what I see is both are connected to the Internet icon somehow !\nAny help !?\n\nA: i had sounds like the same problem\nsome how the TC became internally corrupted. \nit had worked fine for two years and suddenly I am getting yellow flashing lights on the AE or green lights with connecting and then disconnecting\nit was not the source router or the AE. It was the TC.

It's now able to update.\nThe problem appears to be due to the fact that when Airmail 2 was upgraded to Airmail 3, the internal app version was 3 while the version shown in the Applications folder was v2. I think this confused App Store.\n", "Q: Why does Flashlight for Spotlight does not work on El Capitan? Can anyone explain, on a deep level, why Flashlight for Spotlight does not work on El Capitan?\n\nA: Flashlight for Spotlight works by injecting its own code into the Spotlight process. This is how it manages to \"intercept\" your interaction with Spotlight in order to enhance it.\nEl Capitan comes with \"System Integrity Protection\" (SIP) enabled by default. Amongst other things, SIP protects system processes, such as the Spotlight process, from code injection from other processes. Another example is that you can cannot attach a debugger to a system process when SIP is enabled. Therefore Flashlight for Spotlight cannot, in a factory default install, inject its code into Spotlight - and thus it doesn't work.\nYou can relatively easy disable SIP by booting to Recovery Mode and running csrutil disable and rebooting. It can be enabled again by running csrutil enable in Receovery mode. again. \nIf you disable SIP you can use Flashlight for Spotlight on El Capitan, but will miss out on the protection you get from having SIP enabled.\n", "Q: When I enter commands in the terminal I get: \"username is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.\" When I try to enter commands into the terminal I get this message \"myusername is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported.\" It started when I tried to edit my host-file. What do I do to fix this? I want to spoof my MAC address. I have the newest version of OS X. myusername is not actually my real username. \n\nA: Probably you aren't logged in as admin user or the admin entry in the sudoers file was removed accidentally.\nSo either log in as user with admin privileges or modify the sudoers file. The sudoers file located in /etc should show the following entries beginning at line 55:\n##\n## User privilege specification\n##\nroot ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nThe last line denotes the ability of all admin users to act with root permissions by prepending sudo ... in the command line – e.g. to edit the hosts file with sudo nano /etc/hosts. Only the root user would be able to enter just nano /etc/hosts and successfully edit the file.\nThe file /etc/sudoers can only be read or modified with root privileges!\n\nIf you are logged in as an arbitrary admin user you have to check the file /etc/sudoers. Since your admin vanished from the sudoers file you have to reboot to Recovery Mode and check/edit the file.\nIn Recovery Mode open in the menubar Utilities > Terminal.

That is, the podcast continues to play (I'm usually using Castro, but it's hard to imagine that's the issue), but I'm getting no sound from the earphones.\nIt's not the particular phone. It happened with my previous phone (an iPhone 5) and it's happens with my new iPhone SE.\nIt's not the earphones. I've had this problem with the stock ph earphones nes, a cheap pair of drugstore earphones, and pair of nice $40 third-party earphones.\nIt's not what I'm physically doing. I keep the phone in my left pocket and on bud in my right ear. But I can do all kinds of activities -- cleaning, laundry, yardwork, whatever -- without this happening.\nIt feels like there's something about the room itself that causes this to happen. If it happens, it usually happens as soon as I walk through the door of the bedroom. \n\nA: Do you have a Bluetooth headphones or speaker in your master bedroom that you've paired to your phone?  Perhaps the phone's audio output is switching over to Bluetooth when it's within range.\n\nA: Are you streaming this podcast?  It sounds like it.    You're probably losing your wifi connection.\n\nA: The problem is probably not a hardware issue. Wired headsets, like the iPhone earbuds, wouldn't be affected by location. If they were, you'd also have issue with your phone itself. Chances are, without any additional information to go off of, I'd say that if you're streaming then you WiFi or Network connection in your bedroom is iffy.\nIf you haven't done so already, reset your wireless router.

I have a Macbook Pro mid 2014 running OS X El Capitan and I also have a 3.5mm audio jack to component plug. I want to display my computer screen on my TV (which has component input) but all I have is the 3.5mm audio jack to component. I don't want to buy another cable and I don't want to by an Apple TV. So, can the Macbook Pro output video (I don't care what quality) through the 3.5mm audio jack port or is there any way to configure it so I can do this?\n\nA: No.  It's an audio port not an audio/video port.\n\nPer the Apple Support site: Mac Basics: Ports on your Mac\n\n\nHDMI and the Thunderbolt Ports will carry both digital video with audio, but your analog audio port (denoted by the headphone icon) will only carry audio. \n\nYour option here is to get an HDMI to Composite adapter that will convert the digital video/audio signals to analog composite signals.  There are different makes/manufacturers.  You should pick one with good ratings and that is not too expensive.\n\n\nA: No. This is an analog port. Not sure the max channels it offers, but most audio uses two to three. Analog video needs way more, hence the pins on a VGA plug. We're in the days of digital, however. HDMI,Thunderbolt, USB-C, etc...\n", "Q: Why is my terminal displaying my IP address beside my name? Well, I was just wondering if it is okay for the OS X shell to display something like this: \n192-168-1-7:~ name$ \n\nWhat does the above actually mean? I have tried setting my host name but still didn't work! \nAnd the Terminal window is name is name--- bash ---80x24\nWhat does that mean?\nThank you \n\nA: The bash interactive shell prompt - if not tweeked further - is determined by the PS1-line in the file /etc/bashrc.\nThe 6th line PS1='\\h:\\W \\u\\$ ' decodes to\n\n\n*\n\n*\\h the hostname up to the first `.' - in your case 192-168-1-7\n\n*: delimiter\n\n*\\W the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde - in your case ~ which is equivalent to the directory /Users/name/\n\n* delimiter/space\n\n*\\u short user name of the current user - in your case name\n\n*$ UserID-identifier (it turns to a # if the effective UID is 0 (~root) - else $)\n\n* delimiter/space\n\n\nA longer list of possible customizations of the prompt (e.g. time, date, bell) will be shown after opening Terminal.app, entering man bash and going down to PROMPTING.\n\nThe Terminal window title shows your working directory, the name of your shell  (bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell) and its size: 80 characters x 24 lines.\n\nYour fully qualified host name is probably 192-168-1-7.SLD.TLD (e.g. 192-168-1-7.dlink.home) and is assigned by a DHCP server in your network.

I decided to use the opportunity to upgrade to an SSD.  I replaced it with a 480GB SSD.\nFollowing this article: Create a bootable installer for OS X,  I created bootable USB with El Capitan. The USB works with the computer I created it on.\nOn my upgraded Macbook,  normal power-on ends with grey screen with flashing folder icon, as expected - there is no OS there.\nWhen I plug the USB drive in and hold the Option key, expected menu with choice of bootable devices does not show. There is the booting sound, the screen turns white with cursor on. The cursor responds to the touch pad but no booting menu appears. \nI don't know how to troubleshoot the issue. \n\nA: The Problem is most likely that the USB Drive was not properly formated and is missing the EFI Partition. You could check via the Terminal by using 'diskutil':\ndiskutil list\n\nThe Result is a list of all Drives and their partions. A bootable USB Drive should have a separate partition like this:\n/dev/disk11 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *16.0 GB    disk11\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk11s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS OS X 10.11 Installat... 15.7 GB    disk11s2\n\nThe easiest solution would be using a third party tool. You should try again using the Freeware 'DiskMaker X'. It formats and creates a bootable USB Drive with the OSX-Installer in a very easy and reliable manner. \n", "Q: Why has Spaces become unbearably slow? I have an iMac with this spec:\n\nI have two external monitors, both 4k. Recently, Spaces has become almost unusably slow for me. Switching between spaces on the main display (usually between full-screen IntelliJ projects) using the trackpad is the laggiest. It will scroll a bit, pause for a second, then jerkily scroll the rest of the way. I think I managed to speed it up a little by removing files from my desktop, but that certainly hasn't fixed the problem.\nIf I open Spaces, then dragging them to rearrange them takes several attempts, because the drag usually fails to start (or at least takes longer than the 30 seconds or so I've tried waiting), and even hovering over different windows takes a couple of seconds before moving the blue highlight.\nFor some reason, things seem smoother on the external monitors, which only have about two applications each on them.\nMost things, like dragging windows around and opening menus, happen just as smoothly as you'd expect them to.\n\nA: I may not be able to pin down exactly what the bottleneck is, but in effect - OS X tracks every single window opened across all apps and then has to lay them out for each space and decide if a window is visible, occluded by another window or in the dock or hidden entirely by Finder hiding an app.\nAll of this calculation is pushed to the GPU for buttery smooth animation. At some point, you will exhaust the resources on the GPU whether it's the amount of pixels being stored, the total size of each window, the number of spaces and calculations to be made, transfer speeds from the CPU / RAM to the caches on the GPU. When you hit that bottleneck, either the GPU can't be as efficient or it rejects the work entirely and then you see the CPU doing the rendering.\nMy suspicion is you are getting the CPU to render which would explain the dramatic drop off in responsiveness. Also - you are pushing somewhere in the order of (5120x2880) + ( 2 x (4096 x 2034) ) = 31,408,128 pixels\nIf you can make this happen on command - I bet an Apple Engineer would love to look over sudo sysdiagnose WindowServer when the machine is performing miserably. A call to AppleCare or a visit to a genius bar would be the step to get engineering involved.\nIn the mean time - you might be able to experiment with reducing the load on the GPU by:\n\n\n*\n\n*less apps with windows open\n\n*less windows open per app\n\n*fewer virtual screens to contemplate\n\n*more hidden windows\n\n*re-cabling the displays so they connect directly to the Mac and not daisy chaining them.\n\n\nFor your 4k external displays - are you in MST or SST mode? - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587 - if you went to SST, that might alleviate the bottleneck or require less concessions on the window count at the expense of a 30 Hz refresh rate. The 5k iMac is listed as only supporting one 4k display in MST mode, so that could be an explanation the issue you are seeing.\n\nA: Try turning off \"Displays Have Separate Spaces\" in the Mission Control prefpane\n", "Q: How do I ensure SMB based volume paths are available? My machine is mymac and the remote machine is remotemac(both are running El Capitan 10.11.6) - I reference a share on remotemac, located at //remotemac/path/to/remoteshare, as /Volumes/remoteshare. \nSometimes, especially when I have recently connected to that remote machine or  share from Finder, the /Volumes/remoteshare path is available. But after some time, that /Volumes/remoteshare path is not available. \n$ ls /Volumes\nMacintosh HD\n$ # connect to remoteshare from Finder\n$ ls /Volumes\n$ Macintosh HD    remoteshare\n# After some time (a few hours)...\n$ ls /Volumes\nMacintosh HD \n$ # note that /Volumes/remoteshare is now missing\n\nWhat can I do in my bash script to ensure that the remoteshare volume is present, or created before it is referenced?\n\nA: In a script you can use the following basic construct:\n#!bin/bash\n\nif mount | grep -q \"remoteshare\"; then # check if remoteshare is available \n    exit\nelse\n    echo not found\nfi\n\ngrep -q ... suppresses normal output. If successful the script exits. In the other case it will echo \"not found\".\nInstead of echo not found you can ssh into the remote server, run serveradmin and enable or restart the smb service – man serveradmin will show you how to do this. Then quit the ssh session and try to remount the SMB share.\nTo ssh passwordless into the server enable key based authentication - passing a password in a script is insecure and error prone. To use serveradmin on the remote server without sudoing, modify /etc/sudoers on the remote server and change the part:\n## User privilege specification\n##\nroot ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nto\n## User privilege specification\n##\nroot ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\nyour_remote_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin/serveradmin\n\nInstead of the line echo not found use something like this then:\nssh username@remotemac\nserveradmin stop smb\nsleep 10\nserveradmin start smb\nsleep 2\nexit\necho \"SMB service was restarted\"\nmount_smbfs //your_remote_username:password@remotemac/folder /some/mntpoint\n\n\nThe inaccessibility of an SMB share may have many causes. It's probably impossible to cover all cases in one script.\n", "Q: iTunes playlists won't sort by Name anymore I have recently had to upgrade to Windows 10, and with the 2 subsequent downloads of iTunes, I can no longer sort playlists by Name (Song title), which is what I prefer on my iPods.

I use the find-command for searching in large and nested directory-structures.\nIn the result-output is sometimes a double-slash ( // ) included.\nExample (after \"Downloads\"):\n#> find ~/Downloads/ -iregex \".*some.*\"\n/Users/michael/Downloads//subDirectory/some_file.pdf\n\nI first thought it would mark the current working-directory. But that isn't the case. \nWhat's the meaning of this double-slash?\nUsually I copy the result into the clipboard, change to the finder. Then \n\"shift\" + \"command\" + \"g\" and pasting the path (until the file) into the box. So that the containing directory is opened.\nWorks fine. But the double-slash I have to remove manually.\nTherefore: How can I avoid it?\n\nA: \nWhat's the meaning of this double-slash?\n\nMeans you're using strange old BSD find.\n\nHow can I avoid it?\n\nYou can indeed omit the trailing slash in your original command, but since it's added automatically via tab completion (which you should definitely make as much use of as possible), & since the trailing slash is actually used in myriad places elsewhere to be sure you're dealing with a directory and not a filename, omitting it is counterintuitive & silly.\nInstead, I suggest doing one of these other things:\na) Make a wrapper for find that pipes to sed: | sed 's@//@/@'\nb) Install GNU's findutils with 'brew install findutils' and then either use 'gfind' directly, alias 'find' to 'gfind', or add /usr/local/opt/findutils/libexec/gnubin to your path (which also adds GNU findutils' 'locate', 'updatedb', & 'xargs').\nc) Switch to a proper GNU/Linux OS that wouldn't have had this problem (& a thousand others) in the first place. :p\n\nA: find is rather literal. When you tell it to search within \"~/Downloads/\", it uses that (including the trailing slash) as the prefix for whatever it finds. Since there's an unnecessary and irrelevant slash at the end of the path you gave it, you wind up with an unnecessary and irrelevant extra slash in the output.\nSolution: remove the trailing \"/\" from the search directory:\n#> find ~/Downloads/ -iregex \".*some.*\"\n/Users/michael/Downloads//subDirectory/some_file.pdf\n#> find ~/Downloads -iregex \".*some.*\"\n/Users/michael/Downloads/subDirectory/some_file.pdf\n\n", "Q: Excel 2011 copy and paste beachball hang freeze issue The issue occurs for some users using Excel 2011 on OSX. \nIf the Excel spreadsheet is of any moderate size, say greater than 10 MB, when doing a simple copy and paste, there is sometimes a very long delay and the colored beach ball appears. It appears the program has hung. \nPressing command option escape, bringing up the dialogue box to force quit an application, shows Excel to not be responding. Yet if you wait long enough, the hang ends, all returns to normal, including the copy & paste being executed. \nFor a big Excel spreadsheet of around 100MB with multiple sheets and graphs, the wait time for a resolution (timed several times) is about 7.5 minutes. \nThis is a frustrating issue to pin down, as sometimes cut and paste in the same spreadsheet works fine.  If not, and you use Force Quit, then often recent work is lost.  This ill defined yet regularly recurring issue is a real productivity killer. \n\n\n*\n\n*It is possible this issue only arises for Retina Macbook Pros.  \n\n*This behavour and issue may be related to more general memory issues with\nExcel 2011 on OSX. \n\n*Excel 2016 does not appear to show this issue, just Excel 2011.  \n\n*The issue appears independent of Office update or OSX version from OSX 10.8.x to OSX 10.11.x\n\n\nA: The best answer to this issue appears here: Excel 2011 copy and paste beach ball hang issue.\nEssentially:\nYou need to do this every time you freshly open the Excel program.\n\n\n*\n\n*On starting up Excel, and before opening your Excel spreadsheet, open a new blank Excel spreadsheet. \n\n*Perform a single copy and paste of an empty cell into another cell. \n\n*Do this twice. Doing it twice is important. \n\n*Close that spreadsheet, and without quitting Excel, open the spreadsheet you want to work on.  \nThe problem should now not occur. \nIt seems that when a copy and paste is performed the first two times, Excel tries to do some mapping of all the relationships in the spreadsheet, and due to some coding issue, gets caught up in some long loops. Doing two copy and pastes first, with no big spreadsheets open satisfies this process with no vast spreadsheet to work through. Hence it avoids the long delay and apparent hang. \n", "Q: Trash folder not a directory, files only delete immediately Trash is not storing files any more.

I'm going on vacation soon (The Black Forest) and I'm planning to take a lot of Hi-Res photos and videos.\nHowever, since it is a vacation, I prefer to stay away from my laptop (otherwise, I would spend time coding or checking work's email).\nIs it possible to move the photos and videos on iPhone to external storage, whether it is SSD or SD card for example?\n\nA: To get it on to an external drive, your photos need to get to a computer first (because an external drive can not be plugged into an iPhone).\nTo get the photos to a Mac, you can use a standard iPhone to USB lightning cable to plug your phone into the computer. Your Mac will normally pop up asking to import the photos, accept this. (Windows computers might be capable of this, I am not sure.)\nOr you can use iCloud Drive for any computer. On your phone, turn on iCloud Photo Library in settings. When your photos are uploaded to the cloud, go to iCloud.com on your computer. Open the photos web-app, select your desired photos, and at the top, you should see some buttons to import the photos to your computer.\nOnce the photos are on your laptop, you can move them to your desired external drive.\n", "Q: Backing up app data from two different devices to the same iCloud account Let's say I have an app that can back up to iCloud Drive, like WhatsApp, on iPhone #1. I back it up to iCloud Drive. However, if I have the same app, WhatsApp, on iPhone #2 which is connected to the same iCloud account, will I be able to back it up to iCloud Drive as well, or will my #1 backup be overwritten?\n\nA: The backup will be overwritten.  \nYour Apple ID is what's used to sync data between devices.  It will take the most-recent change as what should be backed-up.  iCloud will think that you want the most-recent change to be shared across devices and it will populate that change to all devices with that same Apple ID.\nThe way around this would be to use Dropbox or something similar as the backup.  That way you can specify separate folders for the backup and prevent one from overwriting the other.\n", "Q: Install Amazon Music on iPhone The iTunes application for Windows says Amazon Music is available for both iPhone and iPad.

If you have auto-sync new apps on it will be automatically downloaded and installed on you iphone, even when the itunes for ios says it's not available.\nIn any case, my application got downloaded too in:\nC:\\Users\\MyUser\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Mobile Applications\\Amazon Music 5.5.3.ipa\nBad Apple, blocking its competitors.\nHow to enable automatic downloads:\nTurn on Automatic Downloads\nMore info: probably that's a glitch, other users also experienced the issue before:\nApp only available on iPad?\nNote that when I did search for \"amazon\" on iTunes on iPhone didn't find anything. Now it does, so probably a server bug or something.

I used a bootable USB drive for Ubuntu to see what happened and saw that all my partitions from the SSD had vanished and the drive was showing up as free space. I am loading up internet recovery but I am not sure what I'll do there.\nEverything went to hell after I typed \nparted mklabel gpt /dev/disk2 or something similar along these lines.\nI don't care about recovering my data but all I want is my MacBook to boot up again\nSystem: MacBook Pro Retina Display late 2011\n\nA: Granted that gparted didn't erase/secure erase data (overwriting important parts of your disk with zeros or arbitrary data) you probably can recreate the old standard GUID partition table which follows a fixed Apple scheme. gparted or similar gpt partitioning executables usually only modify the first and last 34 blocks (512 B) or 6 blocks (4096 B) of a disk. \nThe fast approach below won't work, if you've modified the disk previously (e.g installed Windows, resized the main volume and added a second partition). It only works with the \"vanilla\" OS X install partition scheme.\nRecreating the old GUID partition table should restore the previous volume(s). Here is a related answer: HFS+ invalid number of allocation blocks.\nThe standard Apple GUID partition scheme looks like that:\n                0           1         PMBR\n                1           1         Pri GPT header\n                2          32         Pri GPT table\n               34           6         \n               40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n           409640  part2-size      2  GPT part - partition type\npart2-size+409640     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n    total_size-40           7         \n    total_size-33          32         Sec GPT table\n     total_size-1           1         Sec GPT header\n\nHere total-size is the total size of the disk in 512 B-blocks. part2-size usually is total-size - 1679216 in 512 B-blocks.\nThe partition type of the second partition is either 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (CoreStorage) or 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (HFS+).\nNewer systems on SSDs preferably have a CoreStorage- and older systems on HDDs an HFS+-type main partition.\nPreparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detach any external drive\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup. \nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend sudo to execute some commands like gpt ... or newfs_hfs ...!\nRemove the an old/wrong MBR/GUID partition table\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter diskutil list and gpt -r show /dev/diskX (with x=0,1,2,3 etc) to get an overview. Usually the internal disk has the disk identifier disk0. Below I assume your internal disk is disk0.\n\n*Enter gpt destroy /dev/disk0 to remove any current GUID pt.\n\n*Enter gpt create -f /dev/disk0 to create a new empty GPT partition table and replace any MBR by an PMBR.\n\n\nRestore previous partitions\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI:\ngpt add -b 40 -i 1 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Recovery partition:\nNow do the math: the start block $sbrecovery of the Recovery HD is total-size - 1269576. $sbrecovery has to be dividable by 8!\ngpt add -b $sbrecovery -i 3 -s 1269536 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Main volume\nDo the math again: the size of the volume $mainvolumesize is total-size - 1679216. $mainvolumesize has to be divisible by 8! Your main volume may either be a CoreStorage or a HFS+-type partition. Here I assume it's the first one: \ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s $mainvolumesize -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Now check if diskutil list finds a CoreStorage volume:\ndiskutil cs list\n\nIf the GUUID partition table is properly restored and your main partition was a CoreStorage volume you should get an output similar to this one:\n  CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group A629E051-D7B0-4B8C-A803-074F62704636\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         System\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         53946696192 B (53.9 GB)\n    Free Space:   16777216 B (16.8 MB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 90C09FC0-4215-4871-901B-70E2C9C7D464\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     53946696192 B (53.9 GB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family F6962E38-50E4-4458-BFE6-CF2E179352F5\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Status:       Unlocked\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        Conversion Status:       NoConversion\n        Conversion Direction:    -none-\n        Has Encrypted Extents:   No\n        Fully Secure:            No\n        Passphrase Required:     No\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume BD36C73D-860D-4DC6-B125-AD624F448B88\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk2\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          53496696192 B (53.5 GB)\n            Conversion Progress:   -none-\n            Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)\n            LV Name:               System\n            Volume Name:           System\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n\n\n*verify the CoreStorage volume with\ndiskutil verifyVolume diskX \n\n(in the above CoreStorage example diskX is disk2 - check (Disk of Logical Volume), your diskX probably is disk14 or disk15)\nIf you get an error or no output your main volume either is a HFS+-type partition or the boundaries of the partition are wrong. \n\n\n*\n\n*Then try the following and remove the CoreStorage-type partition and create an HFS+-type partition instead:\ngpt remove -i 2 /dev/disk0\ngpt add -b 409640 -i 2 -s $mainvolumesize -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Verify the volume:\ndiskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s2\n\n\nIf you run into problems or get strange errors please post a comment to the answer!\n", "Q: How to manually uninstall Adium completely from Mac OS X? How do I manually uninstall Adium from Mac OS X?\nI uninstalled Adium using \"AppCleaner\", which seems to have caused my \"Internet Accounts\" logins to malfunction (I'm guessing the uninstaller deleted necessary files that were modified by Adium). So, I don't want to use another uninstaller app to get rid of it.\nI thought Adium was gone, but I now have an \"Adium.\" Internet password in Keychain Access that reappears every time I delete it. Getting info on it tells me the location is \"AdIM://Adium.\".\n\nA: Uninstalling Adium is similar to uninstalling most Mac OS X applications.\nNote: The \"Library\" folder mentioned below is hidden in OS X versions 10.7 and newer.\nRemoving the Adium application\nMost of Adium is contained within a single application bundle—that's the green duck you dragged to your Applications folder in InstallingAdium.\nMake sure Adium is not running.\nDrag the Adium application (Usually located in /Applications) to the trash.\nRemoving settings, chat transcripts, and Xtras\nAdium stores all of your important preferences (including accounts—specifically, the service each account is on and each account's username), all of your transcripts of previous chats (if you didn't turn logging off in Adium's Preferences), and all Xtras you've installed in this folder:\n~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/\nAdium also places preferences and supporting files in the following locations (in your 'Home' folder):   \n~/Library/Caches/Adium/\n~/Library/Caches/Adium Crash Reporter/\n~/Library/Preferences/com.adiumX.adiumX.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.adiumx.crashReporter.plist\nRemoving the Address Book scripts\nAdium also installs Apple Address Book contextual menu actions via AppleScripts in the following location:\n~/Library/Address Book Plug-Ins\nMove all of these to the Trash (preferably with Address Book not running).\nRemoving saved passwords\nAdium stores your passwords in your Keychain. To remove them from there open Keychain Access (in your Utilities folder)\nsearch for “service.username” (for example, “AIM.jdoe”).\nselect it and press the Delete (⌫) key.\nKeychain Access will require your keychain password to go through with this; usually, this is the same as your Mac OS X login password. (It is not the password you're deleting.)\nThat said, it is safer to leave them in the Keychain, so you don't delete a password saved by another application by mistake. There is no harm in having keychain items that you aren't using.\n", "Q: Credits in spotlight.app At /System/Library/CoreServices/Spotlight.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj There is a fake called \"Credits.rtf\" only containing some random text.\nIs it an easter egg or something malicious?\np.s it's also in the other xx.iproj folders.\n\n\nA: That's the default text inside the same Credits.rtf file when creating a new OS X Application in Xcode.\nI assume Apple didn't bother changing it since they figured no one would bother looking.\n", "Q: How many additional numbers can I set in one contact?

Thanks.\n\nA: After modifying .bash_profile you have to either source the modified bash profile with source ~/.bash_profile or close the current and reopen a new Terminal window to have the changes take effect.\nUPDATE: I had done some testing, now the solution is definitely restart Terminal.app. source ~/.bash_profile to reload is not enough.\n\nA: Pipes send the standard output of one command to the next command in the pipe which becomes standard input for that command. In your command statement:\n sublime \"$1\" | echo \"'use strict';\" > \"$1\";\n\nthe pipe is useless. The next command echo does not use any output coming through the pipe. Plus text editors normally display the buffer which is not standard output. Text editors will except standard input given the proper options and placement in the pipeline. The following should open a new unnamed text file with the first line 'use strict';\necho \"'use strict';\" | sublime -\n\n", "Q: Mouse middle click in Mac OS — Misson Control and Close Tab at the same time: How To?

It is based on the latest version and @Scott says it works well. Available for download here on github. \n(I wondered why https://safari-extensions.apple.com/?q=ublock turns up 0 results.  Still does, oddly. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/1596 explains why for a while there was no uBlock Origin for Safari.)\nUPDATE: Another option is to try Opera.  It now comes with a built-in ad-blocker which, it's said, allows it to work much faster.  Safari has also received some enhancements that allow it to do a limited amount of ad-blocking very quickly.\nEvidence the uBlock extensions speed things up\n\nA: For an adblocker to work properly, it needs to inspect every item on the page you're loading and compare the contents to its own, internal, list of known ad content.  This will slow-down your page loading time.  By how much it's slowed all depends on the device, how much content (text, images, and ads) are on the page, and the network/internet connection.\nYou can help the adblocker by white-listing certain sites where you don't mind seeing ads (for instance, to support a site by allowing ads).  Each adblocker handles this slightly different so you'll need to refer to the instructions.\nAdblockPlus has a blog posting regarding how using their own browser, instead of Safari, allows pages to load a little-bit faster. \nYou're going to have the same problem regardless of which adblock app you use.  I recommend trying a few of them and tweak the settings to see which one works best for you and your device. \n", "Q: How do I remove an app folder is OSX when all else fails?

Also, when I plug in the external monitor, the computer becomes very sluggish and kernel_task starts taking insane amounts of CPU.\nSo it looks like I need a SMC reset.\nMy question is: what does it entail? Will I lose some settings/configurations? Do I need to back up some data? Is there any risk that the system will not work properly after the reset?\nAs weird as it sounds, I did not see these questions ever addressed anywhere the reset was mentioned online.\nThis is my working computer, so it would be very inconvenient if I somehow disabled it.\n\nA: Will I lose some settings/configurations?\nNo.\nDo I need to back up some data?\nWell, you should always have backup of important data. When it comes to SMC reset it does not touch your storage/hard drive. So no data should be affected.\nIs there any risk that the system will not work properly after the reset?\nThere is a very slight risk. In 99,9999% of all times, if the computer are working perfectly and has no hardware issues the computer till work 100% properly after SMC reset.

I am trying to access a USB, but I can't Ok, so here's the deal. I have a picture, from Google Images, that I am trying to put on a flashdrive or such so I can make it the profile picture to the account I am currently logged into. I have the latest OSX and everything is up to date. I am on a Safari only guest account. Whenever I try to download anthing to the computer directly, I only get a \"Safari could not download the file “Just Another Day For Arceus.mp4” because there is not enough free disk space.

File Vault is a program that comes with your Mac and encrypts your hard drive so only people with the password to do so can look at files on your Mac.\nApparently once File Vault is activated, you can only access Safari on a guest account, as stated here.\n\nIf you log in as that guest user, you don't get access to your hard\ndrive; you can only access the Safari web browser and a network\nconnection. Exiting Safari simply returns you to the FileVault 2\npre-boot login screen.\n\nThis means, you cannot save e.g. images to your computer and then put them on a external drive. This is (as far as I know) because files are not uploaded directly from an USB device to the Internet: your computer performs the task of moving the file from the USB device to the hard drive and from there to the Internet.\nI'm afraid as long as you can't change the settings with the Admin Account (in this case you'd have to deactivate File Vault) you cannot save files to your computer or an external drive.\nWhat you could do instead: access your e-mail client within Safari (if you have Gmail, just go to Gmail and then right-click on the picture you want to get and choose \"Copy Image URL\" and then paste the URL in your e-mail and have it send to yourself (just send an e-mail to your own e-mail address) With this way, you can download it on another computer, once you access the URL of the picture.\nGoogle's instructions for this:\n\nComputer\nDo a search on images.google.com for the image you want to find.\nIn your browser’s address bar at the top of the page, click once\nto select the entire URL.\n(If you're looking for the URL of an image\nresult, you need to click on the image to open up a larger version\nbefore selecting the URL.)\nRight-click the image.\nDepending on what system you’re using, select the image URL by clicking one of these:\nChrome: Copy image URL\nSafari: Copy image address\nInternet Explorer: Properties > Copy the URL address shown\nFirefox: Copy image location\n\nI hope this wasn't \"too easy\" for you and let me know if it works out!\n", "Q: How can I figure out what's opening a Terminal window whenever I log in? Whenever I log in to my Macbook, a terminal window pops up with what appears to be some Java CLI help text and a [Process completed] (or whatever) at the bottom.

I vaguely remember installing the thing a long time ago that caused this to start happening; but I don't remember what it was or how to find it.\nI've Googled \"Mac startup scripts\" and checked various directories for any obvious culprits, but nothing jumps out. Is there any good way for me to definitively determine what startup item is causing this window to open, so that I can get rid of it? For example does the Terminal app provide any visibility into what command started it up (is that what's printed at the top)? And if so can I easily deduce from that where the startup script/daemon/agent/whatever is?\nBasically, what would you do if you were me? Admittedly this is really just an aesthetic annoyance, nothing more. Maybe the sane answer is \"I'd leave it alone rather than risk screwing something up.\" Just seems irritating that I can't even figure out how to stop a window from popping up whenever I reboot my computer.\n\nA: This might not be too helpful, but you can always check the date you downloaded things in your Applications folder and (if you remember the date, even vaguely) if you delete it, or anything non-essential near that date, then go by the process of re-installing what you want to find out what is causing the problem (or just leave them uninstalled). \nThis is my recommendation, and if you are still seeing problems I would recommend Apple Tech Support (the official one).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro OSX 10.6.8 - iPhone SE I just bought an iPhone SE and I want to synchronize it with my iTunes library but when I connect the iPhone to my Mac I get a message saying that the iPhone can't be used because it requires a later iTunes version.

It programmatically manages Mac displays, including display resolution, refresh rate, rotation, brightness, screen mirroring, and HDMI underscan. Its primary intended purpose is to allow system administrators and developers to automatically configure any number of Mac displays, by use of the command-line scripts and the Display Manager Python library. It can easily be integrated in Jamf Pro, Outset or Munki or other client management systems.\nWe use Display Manager in our environment for multiple use cases like on our digital display systems to rotate the display 90 degree's and exactly set the HDMI underscan, on podiums setting video mirroring and allow the instructor quickly toggle mirroring on or off, set default resolution & brightness on shared systems like student labs or staff/faculty systems and reset the default after at times like user login/logout or on demand, etc.\nIf you are interested in reviewing the code or trying it out see the following GitHub repository...\nhttps://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/display_manager\nPlease let us know if you have an question, problems or have feature requests.\n\nA: You can also use Hammerspoon to do this programmatically.

The end result is an AppleScript application that when run simply toggles back and forth between the two arrangements. This app can be run in all the normal ways any other application can be run.\nIn the image below, you see the normal and flipped arrangements of the Displays and Menu bar showing the difference relationships between my MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt Display. \n\nThis AppleScript application, along with the hsscreens binary executable file, programmatically toggles between the two arrangements shown in the image above, shifting  the MacBook Pro's Display to the right or left of the Thunderbolt Display maintaining the Menu bar on the MacBook Pro's Display.\nTo code this, I needed to determine what the current arrangement was and then act accordingly. To do this I used hmscreens -info in a Terminal twice, once while in each arrangement.\nLooking at the outputted information I saw a piece of info that I could grep for, in order to the set a flag to toggle against.\n\nOutput of hmscreens -info in a normal arrangement of the Displays:\n$ hmscreens -info\nScreen ID: 68822100\nSize: {1440, 900}\nGlobal Position: {{0, 0}, {1440, 900}}\nColor Space: NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace\nBitsPerPixel: 32\nResolution(dpi): {144, 144}\nRefresh Rate: 0\nUses Quartz Extreme: YES\n\nScreen ID: 68695180\nSize: {2560, 1440}\nGlobal Position: {{1440, -540}, {4000, 900}}\nColor Space: NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace\nBitsPerPixel: 32\nResolution(dpi): {72, 72}\nRefresh Rate: 0\nUses Quartz Extreme: YES\n\n$\n\n\nOutput of hmscreens -info in a flipped arrangement of the Displays:\n$ hmscreens -info\nScreen ID: 68822100\nSize: {1440, 900}\nGlobal Position: {{0, 0}, {1440, 900}}\nColor Space: NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace\nBitsPerPixel: 32\nResolution(dpi): {144, 144}\nRefresh Rate: 0\nUses Quartz Extreme: YES\n\nScreen ID: 68695180\nSize: {2560, 1440}\nGlobal Position: {{-2560, -540}, {0, 900}}\nColor Space: NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace\nBitsPerPixel: 32\nResolution(dpi): {72, 72}\nRefresh Rate: 0\nUses Quartz Extreme: YES\n\n$\n\n\nIf was obvious, to me, I needed to use info from Global Position: to determine what the current arrangement of the Displays were. I immediately saw -2560 as unique between the output and a way of determining the current arrangement.  If I greped for -2560 and found it then I was in the flipped arrangement, not the normal arrangement. So this is what I used to determine the current arrangement and thus toggle between the two arrangements. (Note: -2560 was not the only thing unique, it's just what I focused on first and felt an easy way to parse the information to set a toggle flag with.)\nSave the AppleScript code below as an application and place a copy of the hmscreens binary executable file within the <appname>.app/Contents/Resources folder.  This way the app, e.g. /Applications/Toggle Displays Arrangements.app is self-contained and not dependent on an external location of the hmscreens binary executable file.\nObviously you'll need to determine what to grep for or use a different method to set the toggle flag and modify the code below accordingly to suite your particular needs (if other then this use case or a different use case).\nAppleScript code:\nset hms to (path to me as text) & \"Contents:Resources:hmscreens\"\n\nset screenIDs to paragraphs of (do shell script quoted form of POSIX path of hms & \" -screenIDs\")\nif (count of screenIDs) is greater than 1 then\n\n    set normalOrentation to \"1\"\n    try\n        set normalOrentation to do shell script quoted form of POSIX path of hms & \" -info | grep '\\\\-2560'\"\n    end try\n    if normalOrentation is \"1\" then\n        set othersPosition to \"left\"\n    else\n        set othersPosition to \"right\"\n    end if\n\n    set secondScreen to item 1 of screenIDs\n    do shell script quoted form of POSIX path of hms & \" -setMainID \" & secondScreen & \" -othersStartingPosition \" & othersPosition\n\nelse\n\n    tell me\n        activate\n        display dialog \"Only one screen is attached to your computer!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with icon note\n    end tell\n\nend if\n\n\nThe image below shows syntactical highlighting of the AppleScript code.\n\n", "Q: Keynote HTML export I am thinking about buying Keynote Version 6.

I have the ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 memory installed on an i5 iMac 27inch setup. Given that my current card is malfunctioning and that versions of that card are prohibitively expensive, which cards could I theoretically upgrade to?\n\nA: According to iFixit.com, you can upgrade the video card to the same one that was in the last 2011 model:\n\nIf you are using the iMac 27\" late 2009 or 2010 model for games you\n  might want to upgrade your graphics card to the 6 series of the last\n  2011 model.\nFor any other reason this upgrade is not recommended as the power gain\n  is only noticeable in games.\n\nSince you have to replace the card, it's definitely a good time to look at an upgrade:\n\n\n*\n\n*ATI 4850 Card Approx $150 (used) to $400 (new)\n\n*ATI Radeon 6970 Card - Approx. $200 (used) to $800 (new) \n\n\nThe ATI Radeon 5xxx series from the 2010 should works as well, but they are very rare for some reason.  For the price and convenience, I would go with the 6xxx series if upgrading.\nIf I had the time to search and scour the web for a good deal, I would try to get the 6970 at a good price, but I don't think I would spend the extra money on upgrading a computer that was technically 7 years old with a graphics card that was 5 years old.  Especially so since the graphics upgrade wouldn't be noticeable unless I was gaming.  And if that was the case, I would probably have a console or a PC...but that's just me.\nThe iFixit link I provided has an excellent step by step on how to replace this card.\n\nA: The Radeon HD 6770M is compatible — see here. I don’t know if it will be any cheaper, though. \n", "Q: Where has WhatsApp gone? WhatsApp was updating on my phone, but then I got a message so interrupted the update.  \nWhatsApp then disappeared from my home screen. When I go to WhatsApp in the App Store I am prompted to open, but nothing opens.\nHow can I get the app back?\n\nA: Just restart your phone. Then the app must bear visible on the springboard.\n\nA: It could  be due to the interruption caused during the update process, sometimes it also goes into infinite updating loop. You can try hard resetting your iPhone, this will not delete your content though, follow these steps -\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button simultaneously.\n\n*Hold both buttons until the iPhone powers down and restarts.\n\n\nThen try downloading the app again..\nOR\nIn case your iPhone has around 3-4 gb of space left you can try this method, it basically clears the cache data from your storage. Even I perform this once a week, it also helps to free some space. Here are the steps -\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up iTunes \n\n*Search for a movie which is around 5-6 gb in size, (Lord of the rings)\n\n*Click on the rent button and just wait for a while the app clears the cache data.\n\n", "Q: iPad mini Wi-Fi in the UK My iPad Mini does not have GPS capabilities.

(Error Code: CONNECTERROR)\n\nI'm fed up & would require to handle office docs & mailboxes from my Windows Host. I can't ssh into for obvious office reasons. Can the community resolve this one?\n\nA: After a lot of trial & error, I figured out the most logical assumptions & got it to work. It goes like this (in-case anyone else finds the same problem & is looking forward to an answer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine the host gate way\n\n*Physically access the computer\n\n*Open up Windows Services (if host is Windows)\n\n*In Services, look for Remote Desktop Services\n\n*In Remote Desktop Services, click Properties & drop down to Automatic if not already\n\n*Restart the Machine (Optional)\n\n\nTry again with your MBP, and with Wireless connection, you need not set any additional GW info on RDP Client. Food for thought is - this could be one possible way out of many other circumstances you run into. Make sure RDP services aren't disabled on the GW which's suppose to distribute the connection packets & route it the way it should. \nLet me know in case I could additionally help with something entirely different if the circumstances are different & RDP services are already not disabled.\n", "Q: I have a new phone number but I'm getting texts from my old number I have a new phone number. For some reason, I'm getting text messages from my old number on the new number. How is that possible? I've also sent text messages from my new number and the recipient sees that it's coming from my old number. Wish I could post a screen shot. \nI am still using the same phone. I just changed the phone number. \nAlso, when someone calls the new number, there's no voicemail message but if they call the old number, they hear my greeting. \n\nA: It might be because your old phone number is still tied to your iMessage. Go to Settings > Messages > Send & Receive and unselect your old phone number. \n\nA: Switching carriers requires you to switch Sim cards so therefore chances of them being related to an iMessage issue rather than generic text message is more feasible since this is also a new phone number therefore I'd suggest you to follow the guide within this Apple document in order to fix this issue.\nIn worst case scenario you might have to Reset your Network Settings which you could do but following this Apple document.\nI hope that it all works out for you.\n", "Q: Flashdrive stuck at 200 MB I’m a Mac OS 10.11.\nI've tried to build a bootable images USB flashdrive on 2 of my flash drives, now I want use them as a storage again.

To solve it follow this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utils. (It is in your Utilities folder inside of Applications).\n\n*Select your USB in the left menu (Select the device not the partition) \n\n\n*Once you have selected the device, partition option in the top menu will be enabled. If you click on it, you should see something like this:\n\n\n*You should see the chart divided in two (EFI and Microsoft Basic Data partitions of your USB). In order to remove one of them just click in \"-\" button, and you should see how all the usb has now only one partition.\n\n*Then rename your partition with your favorite name, and select format (I recommend you Exfat because it can be read both Windows and Mac and is much better that Fat32 since it has no 4GB limit for files)\n\n\n\n*Finally just click Apply and you should have your USB formatted. \n\n\nRemember that if you want, you can create more partitions in your USB but you must choose the correct format for each one, in order to be able to read it on multiple SO.\nI hope it helps you.\n\nA: You can try force format using terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter this in the terminal \"diskutil list\"\n\n*Then a list of devices will be shown.\n\n*\"diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ diskname diskidentifier\" replace disk name with device to formatted.\nIn the command above, change “JHFS+” to “HFS+” if you want a volume that is not journalled. Change “diskname” to the new name you want for the disk, and replace “diskidentifier” to the Disk Identifier obtained from Disk Utility. If you want to reformat, replace eraseDisk with reformat and delete the “JHFS+” and “diskname” parts of the command.\n\n\nYou can try the above steps. Hope this will help.\n\nA: Your flash drive is partitioned using the GUID Partition Table scheme. You need to partition the flash drive using a Master Boot Record scheme.

The Retina MacBook 8,1 is not listed as a compatible hardware model for Ubuntu 16.04.\nIndeed the Ubuntu bug tracker has open bugs for support for stuff like keyboard, touchpad and others:\nTouchPad doesn't work\nKeyboard doesn't work\nThe same issues exists in the Linux kernel bug tracker, so they might be generic Linux issues and not Ubuntu specific.\nI have seen reports from others that sound is not supported and that the SSD is hard to get working.\nSo all in all, unless you're willing to put in effort to fix these issues yourself - it is probably not going to be a good experience running Ubuntu natively on the MacBook.\nInstead you could look at virtualized options.\n", "Q: How to change how long notifications stay on a Mac?

A Late-2013 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina (MBPr) of mine was fried by a water spill and some very important data is on the hard drive. My most recent back up doesn't include this data. I know the computer is fried but I'm not sure if the hard drive is recoverable or not. Sparing the details, recovery of this data is very time sensitive. \nAttempted solutions so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*I took off the back of my computer to check if the hard drive was recoverable. Unfortunately I need a SSD adapter for an A1502 MBPr drive to find out, so this is not an immediate solution. I looked into purchasing a connector but everyone I found online won't arrive for at least a couple weeks. I can't wait that long.\n\n*The company Apple recommends you take your computer to for data recovery wants ~$1000 as an estimate, and the turnaround time is not guaranteed. This is the \"standard priority\" price, meaning I might spend money that I don't have and not even get the data recovered in time.\nMy thoughts on my next attempt at a solution:\nI've ordered a new MBPr to replace my old one. It arrives in a couple days. My thought is to take off the back of my new MBP and plug in my old drive. From what I've read Apple hasn't updated their hard drive since 2013, so my old drive should be compatible with the new MBPr. If the old drive is okay then I should be able to restore my data before the weekend.\nI'm asking for opinions on this solution. I recognize that this would void my warranty, but it is also my understanding from a friend's friend that works at the Genius Bar that there's no way for Apple to ever know I did this should I need to use my warranty for something in the future. For what it's worth, I would do this with the assistance of a very computer-savvy friend.\nIn particular, I am wondering if anyone can answer the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone confirm that my 2013 A1502 MBPr drive is compatible with the current MBPr model?\n\n*Will opening up my computer and temporarily swapping the hard drives compromise my new MBPr in any way?\n\n*Am I misinformed about Apple being unable to know I opened the back of my new MBPr should something go wrong? \nAlternative solutions welcome. Please help.\n\nA: First, some (semi) good news. Your data is most likely fine. The $1000 option is for severely damaged and / or corrupted drives.\nThe SSD adapter is the best choice - it will turn the SSD into an external drive and you can copy stuff off in the usual manner. 2 weeks is unreasonable - do you live somewhere not serviced by FedEx overnight?\nPutting the old drive in a new MBP is possible - it will either fit or not fit, at which point you wait for FedEx to deliver the SSD adapter. However, the new MBP will require the most recent OS. If you kept the old one up to date it should run just like the old one. If you were still running Yosemite or Mavericks it will probably not boot - the old software doesn't know about the newer hardware.\nA quick look at teardowns (you didn't specify 13 inch or 15 inch) show the drives are somewhat different - when I say \"fit\" above I mean the connector goes in the slot far enough to work. Not that it sits in it's space and you can put the backplate on again.\nIf you can find a 2013 MBP from any of the used computer dealers you definitely will be able to drop the old drive in and carry on as before. Updating your backups (and backup process) first of course.\n\nA: To answer your questions...\n\n\n*\n\n*The Early 2013 MBP uses a proprietary PCIe  SSD.  The 2015 uses a proprietary PCIe 2.0 x4 SSD. These are not compatible.  If you have a Late 2013 they will be compatible.\n\n*Opening your MacBook Pro and swapping SSD's will technically not compromise your Macbook Pro.  What you do to the MBP while it's open is another story....\n\n*You opening your MacBook Pro (or any consumer device for that matter) cannot void your warranty per US law (see The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act) No company, regardless of what tamper evident sticker they put on their product can void your warranty if you open it up.1 \nAs for saving your data, you will need a [USB to PCIe adapter][2] specific to the Apple SSD.  I have used this specific model in the past with no problems.   You can then connect it to a computer with USB and retrieve your data.\nAs for your liquid damaged MBP, I highly recommend sending to Rossman Computer Repair in NYC.  He is by far, the best logic board rework guy I have found.  I have sent him many logic boards that others couldn't repair and he fixed them all.  The repair typically costs half the price of a new logic board (around $300-400). \nDisclaimer:  I am not affiliated with him in any way other than being a customer.  He even shows his work on YouTube  He's a bit wordy at times and very blunt being a New Yorker.\n\n1 I am not a lawyer and I don't play one on TV.

Will it do on her device also?\nPlease help\n\nA: Same AppleID, eh?  Would you get each others' Facetime calls?  Would you be responsible for paying for her \"in-game\" purchases?  I guess you can set up \"Parental Controls\" (with you as the parent) to limit what she can do.  But is that really what you want?  Why not let her get her own AppleID?  There is a \"family plan\" for sharing downloads.\n", "Q: Trackpad collapsed on the right side (unusable) and very risen on the left side. Is this fixable? I have a MacBook Pro. After 4-years of use, the right side of the trackpad has completely collapsed. It can no longer be pressed. The left side has risen significantly, but is usable.\nGiven how a MacBook is built, is it possible to open it up, remove the battery, and maybe tighten some screws (or whatever) to level out the trackpad?\nnotes\nMacBook Pro (13\", mid-2012)\nI've already opened it once to upgrade to a (256-gb SSD) and (16-gb RAM).\n\nA: If the trackpad is lifting out of the casing, then it is likely a battery problem. Usually costs $200 USD to get everything that has been damaged replaced. This includes installation at an Apple Store. \nHere is the price breakdown\n\n\n*\n\n*Battery: $130 USD\n\n*Trackpad: $50 USD\n\n\nBetter get to Apple Store. They will likely warranty the new battery for a year just in case it happens again. Your choice though.\nIf you feel like taking the risk and doing it yourself, maybe see iFixit.com... I have attached this link for a trackpad replacement, and this link for a battery replacement.\n", "Q: Transferring an iMovie project with AirDrop gives \"Insufficient Space\" repeatedly I've come across this problem a few times now.\n\n\n*\n\n*I initiate a transfer of an iMovie project from my iPhone to my son's iPad (both with current software as of August 2016: iOS 9 and iMovie 2).\n\n*The transfer appears to complete, but then we see Insufficient Space. There's not enough disk space to copy this project. About X MB more space is needed on my son's iPad.\n\n*We free up some space on my son's iPad (more than X MB) and repeat the transfer.\n\n*Sadly, we see the same error message.  The free space we created in the previous step has disappeared.\n\n*We free up some more space and repeat this process, my hair gradually turning white.\n\n\nWhere is the free space going, and how can we successfully transfer the project?\n\nA: I think the following is what actually happens when using AirDrop to transfer an iMovie project from one iOS device to another:\n\n\n*\n\n*The project is transferred from the sending device into an \"iTunes\" holding area on the receiving device.  (I'm putting \"iTunes\" in quotes here, because iTunes the desktop app isn't actually involved in this AirDrop process).\n\n*The receiving device then copies the project from there into the main iMovie area.\n\n\nThe issue described in the question occurs when there is enough space to complete step (1), but not step (2).\nThe \"iTunes\" holding area can be managed, once you understand this and know what to look for.\nOn the main iMovie screen (which allows selection between Video / Projects / Theatre), there is an arrow-into-box icon.  This is at top left (iPad) or bottom left (iPhone):\n\nPress the arrow-into-box icon and then select the iTunes tab.  This lists the items available in the \"iTunes\" holding area I described above.\n\nProjects that failed to complete an AirDrop transfer due to a failure at step 2 are listed here.  This is the cause of the repeated lack of space.\nTapping on an item imports it into iMovie (as in step 2 above), if there is enough space.\nTapping the bin icon allows items to be deleted.  Deleting unwanted items should help to free up enough space to resolve the issue.\n", "Q: configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables (ld: unknown option: -no_weak_imports) I'm trying to get certain tools such as wget for my mac, and in my Internet adventures I stumbled upon this program called Homebrew, which seems like just the thing I need.\nSo I installed Homebrew using the script from their website, and everything ran OK.

Why is it caused? And most important, how do I fix it?\nP.S. I'm running macOS Sierra (10.12) and Xcode-beta.\n\nA: More recent versions of Homebrew pass the -no_weak_imports flag to ld if Homebrew detects Xcode 8.0 or later, which ships with a version of ld which supports this flag (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/3727). However, ealier versions of Xcode 8 beta don't have this, causing ld to fail when autoconf tests the compiler.\nThere are a couple of solutions to this problem:\n1. Update Xcode to the latest beta (Recommended)\nAssuming that you can download the latest beta from the App Store, installing it should also install the version of ld that works with Homebrew. This solution should be easier.\n2. Override the Homebrew checks for Xcode 8\nThe checks Homebrew makes for Xcode 8 are done in\n/usr/local/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/mac/extend/ENV/shared.rb\n\nwhich contains\nmodule SharedEnvExtension\n  def no_weak_imports?\n    return false unless compiler == :clang\n\n    if MacOS::Xcode.version && MacOS::Xcode.version < \"8.0\"\n      return false\n    end\n\n    if MacOS::CLT.version && MacOS::CLT.version < \"8.0\"\n      return false\n    end\n\n    true\n  end\nend\n\nAdding a return false after the function declaration prevents Homebrew from passing the -no_weak_imports flag, fixing the error:\nmodule SharedEnvExtension\n  def no_weak_imports?\n    ## This fixes the issue\n    ## CHANGE THIS BACK LATER\n    return false\n    ##\n    return false unless compiler == :clang\n\n    if MacOS::Xcode.version && MacOS::Xcode.version < \"8.0\"\n      return false\n    end\n\n    if MacOS::CLT.version && MacOS::CLT.version < \"8.0\"\n      return false\n    end\n\n    true\n  end\nend\n\nIf you take this approach, you should:\n1. Make a note somewhere that you've done it, and change it back when you update Xcode\n2. Be on the lookout for errors when upgrading Homebrew - I'm not sure of the details, but it's possible that a brew upgrade will either break or overwrite it.\n", "Q: Simple video management and processing tool for Mac? I'm looking for a non-professional tool (open-source or commercial) to manage video collection and perform simple processing:\n\n\n*\n\n*import videos and photos (from an SD-card) and parse date from file names\n\n*browse videos and photos by date and manually assigned names or tags\n\n*make video from photos (\"slide show\" produced by my camera)\n\n*rotate, cut, and trim videos\n\n*probably perform other simple manipulations like changing brightness\n\n\nSingle tool is preferred.\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*bash + ffmpeg\nThis works of course but is a bit of pain.\n\n*iPhoto + iMovie + QuickTime player\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhoto is ok, except that I need separate tool for video processing.\n\n*iMovie is almost ok for video processing, but it sometimes hangs when rotating video, so I'm using QuickTime player for rotating. Also, I was unable to set high fps when making video from photos, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\n*QuickTime player is also almost ok for video processing, but free version doesn't support making video from photos, and I didn't try Pro version yet.\n\n\n\nSo iPhoto + QuickTime player Pro is likely to be a solution, but I'd like to look at the alternatives before buying anything.\n\nA: One option is DaVinci Resolve, it is free, but requires 16 GB of RAM and the largest GPU available for the machine. \nRequirements:\n\nif you're looking for something on the simpler side, and free I may add, GoPro Studio is also available for free, but with some limitations, such as with filters and effects that must be rendered in another software before being imported into the software itself.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use Live Photos in iMovie? Is there a way to use Live Photos in iMovie on macos or ios? Or do we have to wait until Apple updates iMovie to make it so?\n\nA: My workaround is to use the Google Motion Stills app to create a video from the live photos and then insert this video in iMovie.\nAll done on an iPhone.\n\nA: If you are wondering if there is a way to extract the video from a Live Photo, there is. But not directly through iMovie. If the videos are still on your phone, you can use Live GIF ($1.99 USD) to convert it to a video file or to a GIF to send over Messages. There are other alternative apps that may be used as well that are free, such as Lively and LP. If you are looking for even more features, Live.ly may be another solution.\n\nA: Yes.  You don't have to buy any software.  Here's the procedure for transferring a \"Live\" photo taken on an iPhone 6 on to a Mac and then into iMovie or Photos as a movie file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your Mac using a USB cable\n\n*Open \"Photos\" on the Mac.\n\n*Select your phone icon should be under a grey \"Import\" title in the sidebar.\n\n*Select the \"Live\" photo(s) and import them.\n\n*In \"Photos\" select the \"Live\" photo you want to convert to a movie.\n\n*In \"Photos\" in the \"File\" menu select \"Export\"=>\"Export unmodified original...\"\n\n*Select a location to save your movie (container) file.  It exports the file as a .mov file.\n\n*You can open and play this file in Quicktime.  But...you're not done yet.\n\n*Right click on the .mov file.  At the bottom of the menu select \"Encode selected video files\".  IT takes a few seconds. \n\n*Now you can choose 480p, 720p or 1080p.\n\n*Save your file (it is .m4v format)\n\n*Now you can import this file back into \"Photos\" and share it as a movie or you can drag it to iMovie and select frames, edit etc..\n\n\nA: In recent versions of iOS (at least 14.6, but probably from 13 already), there is a direct Save as video action from the Photos App Share menu.  You then have both the live photo and the video in your Photos Library and can use the video directly in iMovie on your iOS device.\nThis feature even allows combining multiple Live Photos into a single video: select multiple Live Photos, then choose Save as video for the whole selection.\n\nA: Use a PC - \nOnce your iPhone is connected to a PC go to \"This Computer\" - \"This iPhone\".\nAll the Live Photos are saved twice, as an image and as a 3 second Video.\nNow copy past all photos to external drive.\nImport to iMovie/iPhoto on your Mac and do what you need to do.\n", "Q: Why is my Applications window different in OS 10.7 Most of my windows are normal but the root Applications window and some others do not have adjustable columns or triangles to open a folder.

I would recommend a RW DVD. They take longer to burn, but are reusable. If your optical drive does not work, post a comment and you can discuss other ways to install Windows.\n\nNote: You will still need a USB flash drive to hold the \"Boot Camp Support Software\" from Apple.\n\n", "Q: Pink and Blue artefacts appearing in the notification centre Hi I just got the new MacBook and installed Mac OS sierra on it.\nI keep coming across an issue whereby there are pink and blue pixelated diagonal lines appearing in the notification centre and when I try to screenshot them they go away. \nAttached is an image I took with my iPhone as was not working\n\n\nA: I do have exactly the same artefacts on MacBook 2016 1.2 Ghz.\nThey appearing when there's some window under the notification centre. Can be seen on FaceTime app window sometime as well.\nLooks like a software/driver issue so far.\nUpdate: \nTried it with clean install of El Capitan — it's not there, everything is ok. So it is a Sierra bug. Reported it to Apple via Bug Reporter as a 10.12 bug.\n", "Q: How to stop a iCloud Drive file or folder download in OS X? I activated iCloud Drive on my MacBook with OS X, and some folders showed as not downloaded yet. So I clicked on the arrow next to the folder name to download the whole folder from the iCloud to my local MacBook.\nI realized that my current internet connection (I am at my friends place currently) is too slow and therefore blocks all the traffic. \n\nHow can I stop an active download from the iCloud Drive to my local\n  Mac under OS X?\n\n\nA: This plugin helped! - lets you select which folders to sync: https://github.com/Obbut/iCloud-Control.

On macOS Sierra, the cloud icon provides the same functionality. \n\n*Publish public link: places a link to the selected file in your clipboard.\n\n\nCompatibility\niCloud Control should work on macOS 10.2 Sierra, and on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\n\nA: This great mac utility, TripMode, should be able to do the trick. \nIt should be able to block all internet traffic and then you can selectively allow apps through individually. Especially useful with phone personal hotspot to conserve on the data used.\n", "Q: Apple Developer Account expired and Ad Hoc distributed app not working I created an iOS app for a small company approximately one year ago. It is a small app to help the employees, so the easiest method of distribution seemed to be ad hoc. I simply had the .ipa file available for download and had the users trust my developer account.\nI accidentally forgot to renew my apple developer account, and now the app will not open on anyone's phone.\nI'm trying to figure out the best method to solve this issue. If I renew my developer account, would I have to redistribute the app to everyone?\nThanks in advance for help\n\nA: You will have to reactive your develop account for sure, but it all depends on if you have to get a new signing cert which you probably do. That will require redistribution of the app.\n", "Q: Format values in text cell I have a chart with two percentage columns (min, max), and a third which is supposed to show the min-max range in absolute values. I use the formula =A2*60&\" - \"&B2*60 in cell C2.

And it sounds like Homebrew is telling you the directory causing the error is /usr/local/Cellar/node/5.0.0/bin/. If this is the case then you simply need to remove the trailing / from this directory.\nBut it also sounds like you are saying you don't see this problem directory in your $PATH. Running echo $PATH will show you which directories are in your PATH. If your PATH contains a lot of directories as mine does, this can be a little hard to read.

Or we do not have to enrolled for MFi program and can directly use framework with SDK accessory offering as it is MFi license accessory?\n\nA: We have helped multiple MFi device guys with their BT needs.\nOur new BT53 has the very latest iAP2 protocol pre-loaded into the module.\nYou do need to be an MFi member to allow you tp purchase the Apple CP before you can take advantage of our BT53 with iAP2.\nWe're seeing speed BLE speed = speed is about 30,000 bps\nOur IAP2 FW can run about 500,000 bps. \n\nA: You do not need to have enrolled to the MFi program to be able to connect with bluetooth in your iOS app. I've developed a bluetooth app without the MFi program and got accepted. BUT I was required to send a hard copy of the accessory to Apple to get approved in the review proces of the app. \nThe MFi program has some pro's, the documentation helps you with connecting to an Apple device, you can ask more technical questions then with a standard Apple Developer Account and it shows customers your product meets the standards of Apple.\n", "Q: Displaying numbers with the right sign I have an odd question: how can I persuade Numbers to show the signs of a series of numbers which may be either positive or negative? The negative sign is a default setting, but there appears to be no default to show the plus sign for positive numbers. It would be useful if it existed, or if some bright spark has a work-around.\n\nA: At least in older Numbers versions (in my example it's Numbers 3.2.2/Mavericks 10.9.5) you can define a custom data format.\nHit the \"Cell\" tab and the \"Data Format\" drop down menu > Create custom Format….\nUse the default Number format and apply an additional rule like in the screenshot below:\n\nand hit the OK button.

So I wrote a small service (a couple of services, really) which basically lets a user capture its screen (full screen or an area) and then make edits if necessary and then it uploads it directly to imgur and gives the user a direct image link.\nI wrote it for myself but people at my workplace got interested and asked me to install it for them. Since my service has a couple of dependancies I basically had to borrow their Macbooks for like 15 minutes to install everything.\nI wonder if it's possible to somehow pack everything so that I can hand it to other people who want to use it.\nWhat my app consists of and what it requires:\n\n\n*\n\n*A package from brew called imgur-screenshot (also available directly from github afaik)\n\n*A number of automator services that I wrote\n\n*A free image editor — Skitch\n\n*A config file for imgur-screenshot placed in ~/.config/imgur-screnshot/\n\n*Doing a couple of quick tweaks in system settings like assigning hotkeys to these automator services\n\n\nI wonder just how much of these things I can bundle together and send as an archive or something to people who're not developers so that can do the installation in a couple of clicks.

There's a reason for this, and here's my context:\n\n\n*\n\n*I live in China. I need a VPN to get to the 'real' Internet. In my case I'm using Astrill.\n\n*Inside my company, its local DNS points our intranet, wiki and other online resources to local IPs. When outside the company, the DNS entries are obviously those available on external IPs for everyone.\n\n\nWhen connected to the VPN, I don't want my machine to look up by public IP, I want to still use the local IP that the local DNS gives me, but all traffic is going through the VPN.\nA solution that I thought of was to put the local IPs in a DNS entry in the hosts file. \nThen I read about a *nix technique which uses a file called nsswitch.conf to tell the system to always use the file first, then DNS. But OS X doesn't seem to use this (the file doesn't exist in /etc/ anyway). \nThis would be ideal because then I could always try to use the local resource wherever I am - normal Internet, VPN connection, or inside or outside my company.\nI can't find any documentation for OS X support of nsswitch.conf or information about if it automatically checks hosts before DNS anyway.\n\nA: This is already the default in OS X. I.e. if you specify a host name in the hosts file, lookups will use the IP address you've specified there instead of doing a DNS lookup.\nNote that this is only true for programs using the system standard resolver functions. Programs can use their own resolving mechanism that is not guaranteed to honor anything you write in the hosts file. However, those programs should be rare and far between.\n", "Q: How to reenable System Integrity Protection How do I reenable System Integrity Protection, after using csrutil disable from the Recovery OS?\n\nA: The opposite of disable is enable, so: csrutil enable\nAt the present time there is no manual page for csrutil i.e. man csrutil doesn't provide any help, however executing the command without an argument displays its internal help as shown below.\n$ csrutil\nusage: csrutil <command>\nModify the System Integrity Protection configuration.

It maintains git repositories for its projects, is able to create and manage them, and provides nice UI for many day-to-day git tasks.\nUsually, when you setup Xcode, you create one or more \"accounts\" within Xcode, used to identify you against the App-Store and other entities, so that Xcode can save you lots of tedious mucking about setting up trusts, certificates, etc. when developing for iOS and Mac. \nWhen you do that --- Xcode will also auto-config git for you, automatically creating the .gitconfig file, with Name, e-mail and the rest. \nHowever, if you refrain from creating an initial account, and create a Mac project right away - your git setup is incomplete, and git itself will produce the dialog depicted in the question.\nYou can either simply configure .git as usual, providing it the basic info it needs, OR go back and add an Xcode account (in Xcode preferences) and let Xcode complete the git settings for you.\n\nA: If git config --global user.email/name does not help, check your Xcode preferences:\n\n\nA: When you are done configuring git with \ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n\nyou can type git config --list to check the content:\n\n", "Q: How can I exclude the photos that are in iCloud Photo Library from my iPhone’s iTunes backup? When making a backup of my iPhone through iTunes, how can I exclude the photos that are already stored in my iCloud Photo Library from the backup?\nI have the impression that an iTunes backup includes all of the iPhone’s data related to iCloud Photo Library. I made a few backups of my iPhone while it is still downloading my iCloud Photo Library (my MacBook is still uploading to it), and the size of the backup keeps increasing. I had also cleared out Photos on my iPhone and made a backup before enabling iCloud Photo Library on it; the size difference of the backups before and after is the same as the amount of storage used by the Photos app on the iPhone (which is several gigabytes).\nPhotos on my MacBook is set to “Download Originals to this Mac”, while on my iPhone it is set to “Optimize iPhone Storage”.\nI don’t really need the iTunes backups of my iPhone to include another copy of my photos (except perhaps for any photos taken on my iPhone which have not yet been uploaded to my iCloud Photo Library); is there any way to exclude them?\nI realize this question is very similar to the question on “Omitting photos when backing up an iphone to a macbook with itunes”, but that question doesn’t seem to involve the use of iCloud Photo Library.\n\nA: After searching some more, I came across the Macworld article “How to exclude your iCloud Photo Library from an iTunes backup”. The article points out that iTunes backups are not supposed to include the iCloud Photo Library data in the first place, as documented by Apple Support:\n\nAn iTunes backup doesn't include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Photos already stored in the cloud, like My Photo Stream, and iCloud Photo Library\n  \n\nThe article reports that others have experienced the same problem where the backup does include the iCloud Photo Library data, and suggests disabling and re-enabling iCloud Photo Library on the iPhone.\nI think I will wait for the upload from my MacBook to finish before trying this. Perhaps the problem will resolve itself after the initial upload is complete. I will edit my answer later.\nEdit: The above tip may be helpful to others, though unfortunately I have to report it didn’t resolve the issue for me. Apart from disabling and re-enabling iCloud Photo Library on my iPhone, I have also tried deleting its backup in iTunes before making a new backup. But I find that the iTunes backups are still taking up a few gigabytes of additional space with iCloud Photo Library turned on compared to when it’s turned off.

My primary screen is of resolution 5120x2880, my secondary of 1920x1200, so I would have to place the latter at exactly 5120/840. \nDoing this using the GUI in Displays -> Alignment seems to be next to impossible, since there is no snapping at the center. Now I'm thinking, is it possible to to this via scripting somehow? Or by editing some screen setup config files?\nThanks much!\n\nA: osx-display-positioner is a command line tool which lets you save and restore the position of multiple displays. The description of the tool doesn't discuss using it to set the display position, but if the settings file is readable and editable, you might be able to use it to accomplish your goal.\n", "Q: How to clear drive space used by Apple Mail App without removing Internet Accounts? I'm no longer using the Apple Mail app built into OS X and it is consuming 20GB+ of space from old mail. However, I do use Calendars and Messages on those accounts. I unchecked \"Mail\" on those accounts, but that doesn't clear the space. If I try to remove the Internet Account, it warns that it will delete all my Messages (the Messages App messages), which I don't want to do.\nIt has been suggested that I simply delete the folder where Mail App stores the messages ~/Library/Mail/V2 and/or ~/Library/Mail/V3.\nCan I safely free up space from mail messages from Mail using this method? \nIs there another method to safely do this?\n\nA: Apple Mail stores its stuff by default under ~/Library/Mail/V2 and V3\nYou can free up space in there.

If a user plugs in an iPad into the USB port of a computer which is running iTunes, iTunes recognises iPad, and allows the user to manage apps or media files on the iPad from iTunes. \nI know iTunes allows users to do that wirelessly (meaning that the iPad is not connected to the USB port of the computer running iTunes) if the iPad and the computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, but it seems that one must first connect the iPad to the computer at least once to make the iTunes recognise the iPad. \nIs there any way to set up the wireless connection between an iPad and an iTunes (computer) without the initial USB connection?\n\nA: No, they have to the 'paired' via USB first. \n", "Q: Is it safe to wrap Mac cord with a cloth? Okay so the cord from the brick has teared a bit and the charger only works on certain angles lol.. \n\n\nSo what i did to hold the cord together was tying a cloth around it. I wanted to know is that safe? Or should I tie an IDE cable?\n\nA: I'm assuming that you are referring to a Macbook brick. \nThe thin (low voltage) side is either 14.5V (Air) or 20V (Pro). I don't know about the USB-C connector. \nCloth MIGHT be safe on the low voltage side if just the covering separated, but if it has to be in a specific position to work, you probably have a broken wire as well which could lead to sparking under the wrong conditions. \nThe only truly safe thing to do is replace your adapter. You can use proper electrical tape until then, but it should only be a temporary measure.\nIf it's on the other side of the brick, replace immediately.\n", "Q: Split View same app twice? Is it possible to view 2 apps at the same, eg. 2 × Mail, in Split View?\n\nA: This is not possible in iOS 9. Only one instance of an app can run at any given time.\nThere is a small change in iOS 10 allowing two instances of Safari to run concurrently, but that is a special case. To do that, long-press a link, and select Open in Split View.\n\nA: This can be done only on a newer iPad or iPhone 6 Plus. running iOS 9 or higher.  You will notice that these apps are not contained into 1 app, they are each running independently of the other.  You can view each app and interact with each app but they can't communicate with each other (other than what's already allowed by the app itself).\n\n", "Q: Rearrange styles in the Microsoft Word Quick Style Gallery Is there any way to re-arrange the order of the styles in Microsoft Word's Quick Style Gallery?\n\n\nA: A Workaround\nThe workaround is to make a separate list somewhere, even on paper (!) or in your head, of what styles you want in the Styles Gallery and then remove everything (or nearly) and reinsert them in your desired order.\nHOW TO:\nRemove styles until your first choice style is at the front of the list. If necessary, remove all styles and add your first choice to be at the front. Proceed through your list, adding styles into the list in the order you desire.\nSince you are identifying your top 6 or 10 styles, reinserting them into the list manually is not an onerous task.\nThis works if you only use your own defined styles. However, if you use some of the built-in styles, those may get bumped to the front of the list anyway. For instance, you usually only use Title once per document, so it's not really a style you might want in your \"Top 5\" list, unless you need to be reminded to always give your document a title. But if you add it to the Quick Styles Gallery, it will always be near the front of the list.\nIf the previous post is true, and it appears to be so, that it is \"currently not possible\" to change the priority level, that's very sad and another way that shows that Microsoft is not interested in Word being useful for professional writers and designers. (Changing the priority may be possible through editing the XML code, according to one post, but many people could not make that method work for them.)\nThis is a useful tool and it really should be simpler, if Word is to be a truly professional tool. Making the Style Gallery order drag-n-drop would be the \"user friendly\" thing to do. But since Word has far more amateur customers than professional, don't hold your breath for it being done \"right\".\n\nA: On OS X, this cannot be done directly, but can be done through the Quick Style list.  In particular, first open the Styles Pane and then select each of the styles that you see in the Quick Style list that you no longer want there.  For each, select \"Modify List\" from the drop-down at the right of each style name, and then unselect \"Add to Quick Style list\".  Then, for each item you do want in that list, do the same thing but select \"Add to Quick Style list\".  To completely reorder the list, you'll need to unselect every style that shows up in the Quick Style list and then re-add them in the order you want.\n\nA: It's currently not possible to change the priority level of a style in Word 2016 on OS X. The priority level is set based on how styles inherit from other styles and at the moment can't be set directly.\n", "Q: Can Automator distribute a large number of files into counted subfolders? I would like to build an Automator application that counts the files in the hostfolder, creates a numbered subfolder named \" [hostFolder name] [counter] \", moves at maximum 128 files from hostFolder in sequential order into this new subfolder, and loops until all files in hostFolder are sorted into subfolders (i.e. the last subfolder will have fewer than 128 files in it). Before the workflow runs, the hostfolder will always only contain files, no subfolders.\nHere's the desired outcome of my ideal workflow using as an example an arbitrary folder containing an arbitrary number of files, also arbitrarily named. (Note I do not need the workflow to rename any files):\n\nA folder named Beans contains 1027 files, the files Legume 0001 to Legume 1027. My Automator application receives the folder Beans as input. Once the workflow has run, the folder Beans now contains 9 subfolders, named Beans 1, Beans 2, Beans 3, and so on all the way to Beans 9.\nThe subfolder Beans 1 contains files Legume 0001, Legume 0002, Legume 0003, and so on to Legume 0128. The subfolder Beans 2 contains the files Legume 0129 to Legume 0256. In other words, each subfolder contains 128 of the files named Legume **** in sequential order. The only exception is the final subfolder, Beans 9, which contains only 3 files, the files Legume 1025, Legume 1026, and Legume 1027.\n\n\nA: This should do what you've asked for. As coded, the only thing you may need to change in the bash script is filesPerSubDir=\"128\" if you want a different file count per subdirectory within the parent directory that's passed to the Run Shell Script action.  \nAdd a Run Shell Script action to your Automator application/service/workflow and set Shell: /bin/bash and Pass input: as arguments. Remove the default code and then copy and paste the code below into the Automator Run Shell Script action.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfilesPerSubDir=\"128\"\n\nfor argument in \"$@\"; do\n    if [[ -d $argument ]]; then\n        cd \"$argument\" || exit 1\n        dirName=\"$(basename \"$argument\")\"\n        fileCount=\"$(find . -maxdepth 1 -flags nohidden -type f ! -iname \".*\" | awk 'END{print NR}')\"\n        subDirCount=\"$(( fileCount / filesPerSubDir + 1 ))\"\n        for (( i = 1; i < subDirCount+1; i++ )); do\n            find . -maxdepth 1 -flags nohidden -type f ! -iname \".*\" | head -$filesPerSubDir > .moveList\n            if [[ -s  .moveList ]]; then\n                mkdir \"$dirName $i\"\n                while IFS= read -r file; do\n                    mv \"$file\" \"$dirName $i\"\n                done < .moveList\n            fi\n        done\n        rm .moveList\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nThe image below shows a testing of the code and the workflow completed successfully as noted by the green circles with the check mark. This is just and example of how to implement the Run Shell Script action, it can be done numerous ways however you just have to pick what method you want to pass the Folders in Finder to it, the rest is done by the script.\n\n\nThe image below shows the code with syntactical highlighting and is included as it helps in reading the code (especially when the code isn't commented, sorry don't have time at the moment).\n\n\nNote: The bash script is not coded to handle an embedded newline in the name of a filesystem object, which IMO doesn't belong there in the first place! Feel free to modify as needed/wanted to suite your needs, adding/modifying code and or additional error checking if/when wanted/needed. Additionally, this is by no means the only way to code  the script to handle what you want automated but it's what I threw together to get something posted for you.

Dialing regular numbers produces the following error:\n \nStarting with iOS 8, you may also dial emergency contacts by opening your Medical ID.

Since there is no known way to configure the default Tracking Speed before I've logged in, is there a way to select a login user without clicking on the user and using the keyboard to select a login?\n\nA: You should be able to choose any of the login users either with an arbitrary arrow key (if the user name is somewhere in the middle more than one hit is necessary) & enter or by entering the first letter of the user name (or the first two if you have several names starting with the same letter) & enter.\nThen enter the password.\n", "Q: How does App Store \"complete my bundle\" work when I've spent more than the bundle cost? I have bought the Hitman app for $4.99. When I checked for the app bundle, it says GET. Does this mean that the bundle is free, or do I still have to pay for it?\n\n\nA: Since you’ve already paid more for one app than the total cost of the bundle, you get the rest of the bundle for free. This is why it says GET without a price.\nIf you had to pay anything, it would show you a price instead. For instance, in my case I see $3.99 where you see GET.\niTunes albums work the same way. Every time you purchase a track on an album, the cost to complete the album goes down, as reflected on the Purchase button. If the cumulative cost you’ve paid for the tracks on an album exceeds the cost of the album as a whole, the button changes to GET and you can download the remaining tracks “for free.”\n", "Q: Which carriers support iOS 10's voicemail transcription?

This new version released 2016-08 is the first to support Retina resolution within a macOS VM. \nPer this page, Parallels Desktop 12 for Mac: Updates Summary…\n\nRetina resolution support for OS X virtual machines\n\nPrevious versions of Parallels, as well as the competitors VMware Fusion and Oracle VirtualBox, provided some support for high-resolution resolutions in VMs of other OSes such as Windows & Linux, but none did so for macOS-as-guest VMs.\nHere are screen shots of the three new settings. The first was the only behavior in the previous versions without Retina support.\n\nThis next shot shows the new Retina support. Zoom into these images to see the difference at the pixel-level. You will see the icons in the next image are much more detailed than seen above, and the edges of fonts and lines are much more fine than seen above.\n\nThe last shot is if you want to use every physical pixel as a logical pixel in the display, rather than take advantage of Retina smoothing. So you get the most usable visual space but at the price of making everything tiny and harder-to-see. Notice how the Finder window becomes zoomed-out, showing much more content but shrunken.\n\nBug\nI have encountered a bug where after adjusting for Retina, when using the VM on an external monitor (not Retina) the resulting image is shrunken, not re-scaled for non-Retina. So text and graphics are squished with too few pixels to represent their true detail.\nSee the following screen shot of part of screen when running Parallels 12.0.1 on an external monitor. The monitor is a plain full-HD Acer brand monitor, non-Retina. Notice how the Apple logo on the menu bar is smaller than the Apple logo on the host Mac, and the menu labels too are shrunken.\nWhile on the non-Retina screen, the scaling options disappear. So I cannot find a way to return to conventional scaling within the VM.\n\nWorkaround is to open the laptop, move VM back to Retina screen, access the Configure panel, choose the third Retina option \"Scaled\", move VM window back to conventional external monitor. You may then close the laptop.\n\nA: Make sure that you have Parallels Tools installed — Retina in the guest macOS won’t work without it.\nAlso, there’s a known bug right now with Parallels Desktop 13.2.0 (and possibly other versions), where it’s challenging to get Parallels Tools successfully installed on the guest macOS. You might think you successfully installed it, but you need to follow a series of convoluted steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Parallels Tools.\n\n*Restart.\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy and allow the Parallels kext to load.\n\n*Install Parallels Tools AGAIN (yes, seriously).\n\n*Restart.\n\n*Click the green full-screen button in the toolbar.\n\n*Notice that it should now be Retina (not blurry).\n\n\nParallels developers communicated these workaround steps in this forum post:\nhttps://forum.parallels.com/threads/macos-10-12-6-vm-stuck-at-1024x768-resolution.342546/page-2#post-832114\n", "Q: What launches an ancient \"Update Helper\" and how do I confirm it's not a trojan?

For example today I get a persistent:\n\nI launch Activity Monitor and sure enough, there is indeed a process with that name.\n\nYet after the last upgrade (to El Capitan) I didn't bother installing either Google Chrome or Google Earth. I confirm this in my /Applications folder.\nBut I do see the folder ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Google Earth Web Plug-in.plugin, presumably left from a previous installation. I am puzzled. After looking at my login tasks\n\nI see that Google Earth should not be running at login.\nWhat launched it, and, more importantly, how do I confirm that such a request from an \"Update Helper\" is not a trojan?\nUpdate\nThe answers and comments indicate that what I was asking is not clear.

It's bad enough if my user files are contaminated, but it's a completely different problem if I give a suspect program superuser privileges and take a chance in contaminating the system.

It turned out that a module \"pynput\" would have to be installed to your (my) python installation:\npython -m pip install pynput    \n\nwas recommended for this, so I had to install pip first. Well …\nThe actual *.py script is not very long, due to my criminal neglect of error handling and others.\n(As I mentioned: This is a FEASABILITY study! )\nHere comes the script – BUT: as I'm no software engineer I won't be able to explain (with authority) why any one special expression is formulated or positioned the way it is.

I named its content \"57.shift\" like AS' \"shift\" key code.\n I needed \"keyDown\" as I decided to let the on_press function only do the key recognition while on_click evaluates the key, decides what action to take and for the current \"run\" stops the Listeners.\n The imported module os comes into play when the on_… functions call \"back\" to MacOS' application \"System Events\" via 2 osascripts (= Open Scripting Architecture language), as AppleScrips.\n The osascripts instruct MacOS' own system to invoke 2 \"integrated\" Mission Control (arrow-key) shortcuts that will switch to left-side (key code 123) and right-side (124) spaces (s.t. called \"Desktops\").\n At the end of the on_click function 2 different Listeners appear, actually to stop their listening (once the osa/AppleScript has worked).\n Next, keyboard.Listener and mouse.Listener are eventually defined and start() ed;\nthese on the other hand are brought into connection with the 2 vital functions.\n Remaining code first defines \"keyDown\" delivers a dummy starting value for key and finally \"joins\" both Listener threads so they \"wait\" for each other (simply said).\n   I mainly researched these codes from pure interest; for testing purposes (unfortunately I use a MacBook with no buttons 4 and 5) I used this line: print(key, \"(\", button.value[1], \")\", keyDown+\" >>  \", button).\nWARNING: As there is no error handling strange things may happen if you experiment my code!\n( Anybody more softwarely educated than me is welcome to improve or comment my efforts, but please leave my bullet list mostly as is.)\n", "Q: Signed binary being warned as signed by unknown developer on OSx I have a binary file.

(I'm assuming the computer itself is still working). \nI did some research and ordered from Amazon a Magsafe1 60W charger, but when it arrived the connecter is too large for the port.\nAny ideas what the correct charger should be? These are the details of the MacBook, purchased in Aug 2007\n\n\n*\n\n*13-inch MacBook (White) - 2.16GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*Part Number: MB062\n\n*Keyboard (English) & Mac OS (English)\nCountry kit\n\n*2.16GHz Intel Core 2 Duo\n\n*SuperDrive 8x (DVD +R DL/DVD RW/CD-RW)\n\n*1GB 667 DDR2 - 2x512MB SO-DIMMs\n\n*120GB Serial ATA drive (5400rpm)\n\n\nA: The adapter that you should get is the 60W Magsafe with \"T\" Connector.  From Apple's Support site:\n\nThat said, I would get an Apple 85W adapter instead of the 60W.  You will have more versatility if you decide to upgrade your MacBook to a different model down the road.  You won't do any damage, 85W just means that's the maximum power draw the adapter will support, not that it will push that amount to your computer.\n\nA: The adapter you bought is a MagSafe 2, and that is why it's too wide. Since you bought the first one on Amazon, here is the link for one that will work. It is thicker but narrower side-to-side: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-MagSafe-Adapter-Non-Retail-Packaging/dp/B00K0BQG9I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1471805469&sr=8-2&keywords=magsafe+60w\nThe power adapters with the original MagSafe connectors come in either L- or T-varieties. Both adapters will fit your MacBook. The reasons for why they have gone back and forth are beyond the scope of your question, but there's no electrical difference and no difference in the physical connection to the MacBook.\n\n", "Q: Delete photos on iPad without affecting photos on iPhone I saw my iPad had uploaded all the photos the same as my iPhone. When I delete the picture from my iPad, the picture in my iPhone is also deleted automatically. \nIs there any way for me to only delete the iPad photos without affecting my iPhone photos? I want to keep the photos in my iPhone only. \nIn the future, how can I avoid my iPad automatically uploading my pictures?\n\nA: What you want to do cannot be done with iCloud Photo Library. By design, all the devices connected to your iCloud Photo Library have a complete copy of your library.\nYou can turn-off iCloud Photo Library on your iPad and use another app when you want to copy a photo between your iPad and iPhone.\n\nA: Go to Settings > iCloud > Photos and make sure \"iCloud Photo Library\" is off.\nIf you don't want your recent pictures to be copied on each device either, turn \"Upload to my Photo Stream\" off as well.\nOn my settings they are both on, but the screencap may help to recognize the correct page:\n\n", "Q: What are all these large files and can I get rid of any of them?

Are they needed or is their a way for me to get some disk space back?\n\nA: Obviously you have or had an Android SDK installed. These images in the SDK are used to test different android versions on the emulator. Simply right-click one of the file and choose \"Show Enclosing Folder\" and you will see to where they belong or what they exactly are.\nIf the Android SDK is still installed, you should be able to deal with them using the SDK Manager.\n", "Q: Why running lldb with HomeBrew Python 2 installed produces ImportError and NameErrors? I had upgraded vim with HomeBrew to version 7.4.1952 on OS X 10.11.6. It installed python 2 as a dependency package (Summarized parts of output is shown by ...):\n$ brew upgrade vim\n...\n==> Installing vim dependency: python\n   /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11: 4,949 files, 66.6M\n...\n\nNow when I try to run lldb, it produces ImportError and NameErrors:\n$ lldb myExecutableFile\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Resources/Python/lldb/__init__.py\", line 98, in <module>\n    import six\nImportError: No module named six\n(lldb) target create \"myExecutableFile\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'run_one_line' is not defined\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'run_one_line' is not defined\n...\nCurrent executable set to 'myExecutableFile' (x86_64).\n(lldb)\n\nThis is my $PATH in zsh shell:\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nHow can I solve these errors?\n\nA: I installed six module with pip python package manager and it solves the problem:\n$ pip install six\nCollecting six\n  Using cached six-1.10.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nInstalling collected packages: six\nSuccessfully installed six-1.10.0\n\n$ lldb myExecutableFile\n(lldb) target create \"myExecutableFile\"\nCurrent executable set to 'myExecutableFile' (x86_64).\n(lldb)\n\n\nA: The Apple lldb (from /usr/bin/lldb) expects and requires /usr/bin/python. Unfortunately, it doesn't use this absolute path to invoke it, but just python.\nThus, with a Python 2 also installed by Homebrew inside /usr/local/bin which is in the front of your PATH the Apple lldb gets an unexpected Python 2 which may introduce errors like missing expected packages or worse.\nThe safe thing is thus to call lldb with a different PATH:\n$ PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH lldb ...\n\nOr even configure an alias or wrapper script, e.g.:\n$ alias lldb='PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH lldb'\n\n", "Q: Move all \"All on My iPhone\" contacts to \"All Gmail\" group I have been syncing my iPhone and Gmail contacts for years and consistently run into this problem. Some of my contacts were created in the group \"All on My iPhone\", always without my knowledge, instead of the Gmail group. Contacts in this group will not sync to Gmail. I have learned how to set my default account to Gmail so hopefully I will stop creating iPhone only contacts, but this doesn't fix the problem with the 100+ contacts I already have in this group on two different phones. Is there a way for me to force ALL contacts from the iPhone only group into the Gmail group? Is there a way for me to export just the iPhone group so I can then import them to Gmail using the web interface?\nAn even better solution would be a way to permanently disable the iPhone only group. I have absolutely no need to have different contact lists. I would love for all my contacts to sync seamlessly across all devices without any \"controls\" to complicate the process.\nThanks for any advice!\n\nA: There is no easy way to move contacts between accounts. No company wants to make it too easy. The only option on iPhone would be to merge the On My iPhone contacts with an iCloud account (turning Contacts on and off if necessary under Settings > iCloud). \nFrom there you can log into iCloud.com > open the contacts web app > click the gear at the bottom left and select all > Click the gear at the bottom left and export vCard\nThen you can import that vCard into gmail.com\nFinally turn off the Contacts for iCloud and it will offer to delete.\nUnder Settings > Mail, Contacts and Calendars if there iOS a default account listed under contacts make sure it says gmail. \nAlternately - type lots. \n", "Q: Unable to install OS X, cmd+R opening internet recovery instead of usual recovery I'm trying to clean install OS X El Capitan on a MacBook Pro (early 2015).\nAfter erasing my disk I started the installation of OS X. After accepting the license agreement I was asked to choose a target drive. I hesitated a little bit and wanted to cross-check if I have created the partitions correctly so I canceled the installation. There were no options to go back to Disk Utility so I restarted my machine.\nNow when I press cmd+R, it always leads me to internet recovery. The only thing I saw was a spinning globe and I was asked to choose a Wi-Fi connection. I connected to my Wi-Fi network and still only saw a spinning globe. After waiting for a long time it has shown the error apple.com/support 2002f \nHow can I access the normal recovery mode and install OS X?\n\nA: Your model Mac was shipped with Yosemite (OS X 10.10) installed. The tags you placed on the question suggest you have upgraded to El Capitan (OS X 10.11). There is the possibility you could have erased the Recovery partition by using the Disk Utility if you had Yosemite installed. Evidently, this would be much harder (or perhaps impossible) to do if El Capitan was installed. Also, I do not know if you were using Core Storage and if so, how this would effect the ability to erase the Recovery partition.\nEvidentially, you can now only boot using OS X Internet Recovery. You can use Internet Recovery to install the version of OS X that came with your machine. From this, you can go to the App Store and download and install newer versions of OS X.\nAn alternative would be to use another Mac to download OS X. You can then transfer the download to a USB drive. You then use the USB drive to install OS X on your Mac. The instructions are given the Apple web site: Create a bootable installer for OS X.\n\nA: I have a workaround for this problem. It seems somehow my system hates my Wi-Fi connection (may be due to some encryptions related to Wi-Fi). When I went to my friend's place and connected to Wi-Fi, I was able to proceed with Internet Recovery. After waiting 5 minutes, I landed on a page similar to normal recovery mode and then I was able to install OS X normally (Yosemite was installed in this case).\nIf this doesn't work, I would have create a bootable installer for OS X as suggested by David's and bmike's answer\n\nA: The Recovery Partition on the system disk corresponds to the version of the macOS installed. Since you aborted installation of macOS just after partitioning (thus erasing all partitions, including Recovery) the only option for your Mac was a fallback to Internet Recovery.\nHowever, according to HT204904 there are actually several key combinations for (Internet) Recovery giving you a choice of macOS version you want to install:\nCommandR - Install the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version. (currently that being macOS 10.13 High Sierra)\nOptionCommandR - Upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac. (currently that being macOS 10.13 High Sierra)\nShiftOptionCommandR - Install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available. (for your computer that is macOS 10.10 Yosemite - source: EveryMac)\n\nA: Disconnect from the network if you care and then hold the option key when you reboot.\nIf you have a viable standard recovery HD it will be shown. From there you can attempt to repartition or download an installer. \n\n\n*\n\n*Check your time, if it’s off more than three minutes, TLS and SSL will sporadically fail. \n\n*Then check DNS, if your Mac can’t find Apple’s servers, this\nwon’t work.\n\n\nAnother option is to use another bootable OS to run the repair / install. Holding option will let you select those OS once they are connected.\nOnce you're booted - the steps are the same as recovering from Internet Recovery: Erased Macintosh HD and installing OS X Lion again\n\nA: Not to take anything away from anyone here... I had hit the wall on this error too. Just could not get the Internet recovery mode to connect to Apple. I found an article that said to edit DNS to 8.8.8.8. I noticed my router had an option for secondary DNS, put in 8.8.8.8 and internet recovery connected first attempt.\nhttps://westerntechies.com/apple-macbook-error-2002f/\nHope it helps someone else. I was worried my 16yo bricked a $4,000 mac book pro!\n\nA: There is another nice way to avoid the DNS time sync problem and the local internet problem with your at home router.\n\n\n*\n\n*Power off\n\n*Tether to a Hotspot on a mobile device with a data plan\n\n*Hold down Option and then Power On\n\n*You will be prompted with a wifi selection menu, select your Mobile Hotspot from the list\n\n*Power Off.  At this point the recovery booter has cached your hotspot as its last internet connection\n\n*Hold down OptionCommandR and then Power On\n\n*Boot loader will now start your internet recovery tethering off your mobile data plan which avoids the DNS and time sync issues.  \n\n\nOn LTE device it took about 6 minutes to move past the internet recovery then proceeded to be able to install the OS again\n\nA: Set the correct date and time via terminal using external ntp server. This is why connection fails (SSL). \n", "Q: Keyboard goes blank when trying to type special character on iPhone I type Polish a lot on my iPhone, requiring special characters.  At some point, this started happening: when I try to type a special character, press and hold brings up the menu, but before I can get to the character, the keyboard goes blank, and I have to give up.  I think the phone vibrates once, and it seems like it happens when my finger slips a little off the row of characters.  A screenshot looks like this:\nWhat the hell is the phone trying to do, and how do I stop it?\nEDIT: This is purely intuition, but I think this is supposed to be a feature, not a bug, though I admit, I cannot figure out what the feature is.\n\nA: It's part of the new 3D Touch feature.  Try putting it on the \"firm\" setting and don't push too hard when trying to get special characters.\n\nA: iOS thinks you have touched the keyboard with two fingers to enable the virtual trackpad. It allows you to use the keyboard like a laptop trackpad and select type in a URL field with it, similar to using the magnifier in the URL field. \n", "Q: Deleted OSX Partition but Wish to Install OSX Again A few months ago I installed Windows 10 on my late 2013 iMac without any drivers. Stupidly, I deleted the OSX partition because the only thing that didn't work perfectly was audio, which I was fine with at the time.\nI've recently started using Ubuntu on my iMac and audio is back to it's good ol' usual. However, I want to switch back to OSX so I can dual boot between OSX and Ubuntu. How can I reinstall OSX?\nThank you in advance. \n\nA: You can use OS X Internet Recovery to install the version of OS X that came with your machine. See the Apple web site: About OS X Recovery. Be sure to hold down the three keys at startup: OptionCommand (⌘)R. From this, you can go to the App Store and download and install newer versions of OS X.\nAn alternative would be to use another Mac to download OS X. You can then transfer the download to a USB drive. You then use the USB drive to install OS X on your Mac. The instructions are given the Apple web site: Create a bootable installer for OS X.\n", "Q: How can I tell if one iPhone receiver works as well as another? My spouse and I were driving onI84/81 in Annville, PA.  Her iPhone 6S was in LTE mode. My iPhone SE was in Edge. We both have T-Mobile as a carrier.\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the two iphones have the same radios on the same frequencies? \n\n*If so, why would I have Edge on one and she had LTE?\n\n*Is there something wrong with my iPhone 6S?\n\n*Is this something that can be tested in the T-Mobile store?\n\n\nIn a nutshell - what process can I use to get answers to these ideas I have as to why one phone isn't working as well as another?\n\nA: You can do some work to narrow down performance, but you'll need carrier help if you find that there's an issue with one device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Safari to do a speed test http://fast.com on both devices - even if you are using different devices, different cell towers (just because two phones are in the same place - they can negotiate different frequencies, different towers or get different levels of service from the same tower at the same frequency).\n\n\nBy focusing on measuring the flow of data - you can over time know if one device has hardware limitations or hardware issues.\nNext, put each device in field test mode: Dial *3001#12345#* - if you can see in the menu bar a number like -76 then record those for each device and then call your cellular company to help determine if you have coverage issues or need to update your phone's settings or software.\n_Note: not all carriers have a useful field test mode. See this and this and that for more details.\nBasically, each cell tower is a time share. It juggles all the devices in range - tells some to be on LTE, others to be on 3G, others to be on EDGE. Unless your phones don't work at all - the cause of differential service is almost always a device that's stuck and needing reboot or a congestion issue on the carrier end. Apple can also run diagnostics if you believe the hardware is faulty - but that's usually a low chance of being the cause.\n", "Q: Java application won't force quit, prevents shutdown I think there might be an issue on El Capitan with Java applications force quitting, because I've seen multiple people talk about similar problems to this with no actual solutions presented.\nI've been writing applications in eclipse, and one application of mine occasionally has an issue where the program ends, yet the java icon stays in the dock.\nI can right-click the icon and tell it to Force Quit, but this has no effect. If I open the force quit window with command-option-escape, the application shows up, but again, force quitting does nothing. The application does not show up in Activity Monitor, so I can't end the process.\nShut-down is impossible while this application remains open. I have to force shutdown and reboot in order to get rid of this program.\nI can run \"killall Dock\" from Terminal, which makes the application disappear from the dock... BUT, the application still shows up in the force quit window, and it still cannot be force quit from there. Furthermore, a terminal-looking window labeled \"java\" appears after running this command. This new application cannot be force quit through right-click, does NOT show up in the force quit window, and doesn't show up in Activity Monitor either. Shutting down normally is still impossible.\nI've seen various other topics where people had this issue with certain java programs under El Capitan, but most had very little detail, and none had a true fix to the issue.\nDoes anyone know why this happens? How to prevent it from happening in my programs? How to truly force quit applications like these?\n\nA: You should be able to use Terminal to kill the process, if you know it's name with the following commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the process identifier (PID). Substitute [your process here] with the name of your process.\nps -e | grep \"[your process here]\"\n\n*The PID will be on the left most column. Here is example output:\n7642 ttys001    0:00.00 grep \n\n*Now type, into terminal, substituting [PID] for your process' PID\nkill -9 [PID]\n\n*Re-run step 2. If the process is no longer there, you've successfully killed it.\n\nBrief explanation of steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*ps gives information of running processes. In this case, we used grep to filter out the specific process we were looking for.\n\n*The format of ps's columns is PID/TTY/TIME/CMD. The field we are interested in is PID.\n\n*kill -9 sends the undeniable SIGKILL signal to the process specified in PID. This signal cannot be ignored by any process and is hence promptly terminated, no ifs or buts.\n\n*As mentioned above, ps gives information of running processes. If your process is no longer in ps's output, it's no longer running.\n\nI would recommend fixing that weird exit bug of yours.\nkillall Dock only kills the Dock process, which forces an update of programs running. This may make your application disappear from the dock, but the app may still be running in the background.\nPersonally, I don't have any problems with Java apps in El Capitan. I'm no Java expert so I probably shouldn't suggest any reasons for this unexpected behavior. Have you tried filing a bug report?\n\nA: In Activity monitor, it's probably just called \"java\", as it's java that's running the application for you. If you run multiple java applications, multiple entries called \"java\" will be in the list, so be sure to select the right one there. You might be able to infer the correct one by checking what files it opened.\n", "Q: What is the usr/local default chmod?

Tried to install it on my wife's iPad but it only finds Lorex apps for security monitoring but not the one solely for the baby monitor. I want to know if there is a way to \"extract\" the program (like an apk) from my iPhone and install it on her pad.\n\nA: Go to the App Store on your iPad. Search for \"Lorex Care.\" In the upper left corner (see screen shot), you can change \"iPad Only\" to \"iPhone Only.\" Then the app will appear.

I was just using Stellar Partition Manager to format a flash drive to HFS+. I deleted the current FAT32 partition and created a new HFS+ partition. I tried to make it as large as I could. Stellar wants to keep 128 MB as \"FreeSpace\".\n\nI'm assuming there is some technical reason for this to have to be so. What is the reason?\n\nA: The reason to leave 128 MB after each partition is given in an Apple's Tech Note: \n\nNote: We leave free space after each partition to make it easier for future system software to manipulate the partition map in ways that we can't anticipate currently.\n\nIn reality they adhere to their own policy only in special cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Formatting a non-system disk to one or more partitions\n\n*creating a Boot Camp partition\n\n\nOn a system disk there neither are 128 MB free spaces between partitions (EFI – system partition / system partition – Recovery HD) nor at the end.\n", "Q: How can I get zsh to show the current path in the prompt?

I'm now thinking about getting a new iMac. Is it possible to connect my Thunderbolt Display to the iMac as a secondary screen?\n\nA: Any Mac made in 2011 or newer has the Thunderbolt port needed to use this, so any new iMac would work fine.\n\nA: New iMac do have a thunderbolt port(not sure which model is the oldest that have one), it should have the thunderbolt port required for the display to work.\n", "Q: Using Automator to set up Finder windows I use Finder windows to display pictures of the my company's employees on a TV screen. A Finder window for every department. The different Finder windows are adjusted to fit in to two 4K TV screens. Is there a way to use Automator or AppleScript to save and recall this exact configuration when needed?\n\nA: The sample script below is coded with the following assumptions, you want the target Finder windows to be as plain as possible, i.e. no Path Bar, Preview pane, Toolbar, Sidebar or Status Bar showing, just a plain window in Icon view with the Title Bar showing the Department name with the picture icons showing a preview of the image and set to a given size with the label shown below the image. Other configurations will require additional logic and or coding. Note: See comments in the code if wanting to set a picture or color for a common background of all target folder Finder windows wanting to be displayed and arranged.\nFor the test environment I used my MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt Display configured with the MacBook Pro as the main screen with Menu bar and the Thunderbolt Display to its right. The script opens the four example target Finder windows, sets the view requirements and arranges them on the Thunderbolt Display as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\nTo use this script you'll need to gather information from your fully configured scenario and make the necessary code changes and to do that, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, open the target folders and arrange them on the screen(s) to suite your needs/wants.\n\n*Note: To make it easier, by having less information to parse in the next step, close all other Finder windows.\n\n*Open Script Editor and in a new window that has no code in it, use the following command to get the proprieties of the arranged opened target Finder windows:\ntell application \"Finder\" to get properties of windows\n\n*In the Results pane, you'll see a lot of information that may look impossible to discern, however it won't be that difficult. You might want to copy and paste this info into TextEdit to do a bit of parsing and have the info ready to copy and paste into the script, as will be needed.\nFrom the information gathered you'll primarily want two pieces of info for each target Finder window, its name and bounds. You can see in the code what the bounds info looks like and how it's applied.\n\n*You'll get the additional view properties needed from Show View Options by selecting a target window and then click 'Finder > View > Show View Options  ⌘J' or just press ⌘J after selecting a target window. See comments in the code about the 'Show View Options' information.\n\n*Copy and paste the code below from the Browser to a new window in Script Editor and then click the Compile button to ensure there are no initial errors in the current code. The comments and code will now be much easier to discern as the Script Editor will apply proper syntactical highlighting to the code, something the Browser just doesn't properly do.\nYou should be able to follow the comments throughout the script in order to modify it for your use case.

In the end, 5 minutes after booting up my Mac simply froze, I wasn't able to do anything any more.\nI decided to reinstall OS X but to my horror I realized that I couldn't select my original disk any more. No matter what I tried (I even booted up using a Windows 10 install disk to remove all the partitions on the disk) , I couldn't get OS X to reinstall on the same disk.\nI finally gave up, installed it on the 2nd disk, installed Paragon Hard Disk Manager which allowed me to finally create a new partition on the disk, and started using it as a data disk.\nI thought I had solved the problem, until I wanted to turn on encryption on the disk. I got an error message, which Google told me meant I didn't have an EFI partition on the disk.\nSo I googled around for a solution, found one but it made everything worse. Now even Paragon Hard Disk Manager can't create a working partition any more.\nSo... How do I clean up this mess? I have a working OS X install, I just want to create another partition on my other disk and encrypt it...\nHow can I fix this?\nOutput sudo gpt -r show disk1:\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34        2014         \n        2048  1953519616      1  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n  1953521664        3471         \n  1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n  1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\n\nWhen I first executed diskutil list the list said there was a \"Microsoft Basic Data\" partition\" on  the disk.

The last one will be built while enabling FileVault.\nYour disk contains none of them.\nOpen Disk Utility (in /Applications/Utilities), choose the appropriate disk (not any inferior volume!) and hit erase in the toolbar.\nChoose a name, \"OS X Extended (Journaled)\" as format and \"GUID Partition Map\" as scheme. Then hit the erase button.\nIf the partitioning fails, close Disk Utility and open Terminal.app. Enter diskutil list. Then enter sudo gpt -r show diskX with diskX: the disk identifier of the stubborn disk. Below I assume the identifier is disk1.\nIf you are sure that you have chosen the stubborn disk (I.e. the one with the 2048  1953519616      1  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 partition) enter:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk1\nsudo gpt destroy disk1\n\nEnter exit to terminate the Terminal session and quit Terminal.

However, on my iPhone I cannot access the server this way and even when I try to open http://192.168.0.13:3000/ on my Mac there is no connection being established.\nThis is definitely a problem with my Mac and not with my program because when I run the server on Windows and try to connect to it with the local IP address it works just fine.\nAlso trying this in another Wi-Fi Network does not help or changing the port does not change anything either.\nI am using Mac OSX 10.11.5 and my firewall is turned off.\nHow can I solve this problem?\nRouting Tables (netstat -r)\n(Deleted)\n\nA: As far as I can tell the behavior is correct. A basic node web server uses dns.js to resolve any hostname – which itself uses the system's DNS resolution method.\nA hostname \"127.0.0.1\" as well as \"localhost\" can't be resolved by OS X's mDNS responder (neither non-reverse nor reverse).\nSo either use your Mac's IP (i.e. 192.168.0.13) or its hostname (e.g. tims-macbook-pro) as hostname. To advertise the service in Bonjour you have to use dns-sd.\nOr create several listening IPs like in this q&a.\n\nA: You can resolve this issue in three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run a port scanning tool from the iPhone to make sure the port is actually open on the Mac. Firewall rules, improper NAT, router / switch issues all can be the cause of another device not getting the correct route to your Mac. If the PC can port scan or browse the Mac web server, you'll know it's not necessarily the Mac.\n\n*DNS issues - instead of hard coding the IP address, you could navigate to http://192.168.0.13.xip.io - that will make sure the web browser works if the iOS device is on an IPv6 only configuration. Unlikely, but at some point this will be more common. You could also use the Mac's IPv6 address instead of the IPv4 address.\n\n*Proxy setup on iOS - again, if your iOS device has a VPN or web proxy configured, it won't necessarily get to the Mac web server. The steps to triage that are also varied.\n\n\nA: Try to add your local ip address into httpd.conf (/etc/apache2/httpd.conf) as below:\nListen 12.34.56.78:80\n\nListen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or\nports, instead of the default.\nSave, close and restart apache with sudo apachectl restart.\n", "Q: How to throttle usage of individual computer with Apple Airport? There are a bunch of kids in our house using wifi. When one is watching HD video on Youtube, everyone else can hardly load a webpage.\nHow can I customize the Apple Airport to throttle usage for all machines using the wifi?\n\nA: Apple's hardware doesn't perform Quality of Service  - so you'd want to install a router that has QOS between the AirPort and the internet connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.howtogeek.com/75660/the-beginners-guide-to-qos-on-your-router/\nIf all the children are on Mac or iOS - you could install a network link conditioner, but that is generally harder to administer and less effective at letting faster access when there isn't contention on the connection out of the house.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to simulate slow internet connections on the mac\nBefore you select a new router, you'll want to determine what the total network speed is for the house. Optimizing for 10 users on 6/1 ADSL service is going to be harder than 4 users of 100 MB or fiber. The tools are the same, but the decisions you make and the end results will vary.\n", "Q: Apple dev license expired - Renew(paying) or else? My paid apple dev license expired a year ago. In the meanwhile Xcode 7 came out with the option of testing locally on iOS devices without the need of a paid license.\nI am now developing a Unity game that targets iOS devices.

I have an Apple TV in a shared space with roommates/friends.  I don't want my personal photos to be shared or accessible there. \nI do like the idea of sharing some purchases and other apps in that space.\nSince Apple TV doesn't have the concept of \"multiple users\", and as of the latest iOS10 beta, that still seems to be true... what is the best way to configure Apple TV to preserve my privacy?\nIn particular I'm referring to the \n\n\n*\n\n*App Store account\n\n*The iCloud account\n\n*Gaming accounts.\n\n\nI'm not terribly interested in restricting content / movies, but I simply don't want people to be able to see my personal photos. \nI also don't like the theoretical sharing of the iCloud keychain, which could put my account & PII at unnecessary risk in case of device theft. \n\nA: *\n\n*Require password to buy - this keeps you in control of spending money\n\n*Don't sing in to iCloud for Photos - you can AirPlay photos from another device when you wish to show your photos.\n\n*There is no interface for reading keychain contents from the Apple TV - so unless you are worried about sophisticated hackers reverse engineering and decrypting keychains - your threat model would be one to not worry about keychain syncing for WiFi credentials.\n\n\nIf you're worried about game center - then you might have to not allow the device to run when you're not present.

Is there an emulator which can run the versions of MacOSX Tiger created to run on computers with PPC architecture?\n\nA: It is now possible to emulate PowerPC for Mac OS 9.2.2 through 10.5 via QEMU: https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/GuestOperatingSystems/MacOS10.4 and https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Platforms/PowerPC.\nYou'll need to install homebrew, a package manager for Mac OS X/OS X/macOS.

I am trying to use my Mac (I have a 2010 MacBook Pro) with ettercap, sniffing and MitM software, but I do not have a wlan0 card. All of the tutorials and recommendations I see for these \"hacks\" require wlan0. I have read that if you have an older card on your Mac it would be lo0, or local loopback, but that didn't make much sense to me considering all of the traffic I was getting from Wireshark. \nSo could somebody please help me on how you are supposed to set this up? Would I need to buy a wireless card for sniffing?\n\nA: Nothing requires wlan0; that's just an alias for your network device.\nTo see what alias your system is using (most likely en1), just issue this command in Terminal:\nsystem_profiler SPNetworkDataType | grep Wi-Fi -A10\n\nThis will output the system info section related to Wi-Fi.  In my case, I get the following:\nWi-Fi:\n\n  Type: AirPort\n  Hardware: AirPort\n  BSD Device Name: en1\n  IPv4:\n      Configuration Method: DHCP\n  IPv6:\n      Configuration Method: Automatic\n  Ethernet:\n\n(I have blanked out my MAC address for security reasons)\nThe device will be what is denoted by \"BSD Device Name,\" in this case, en1\nSo, if I wanted to issue a command specific to my wireless card, I would use that alias.  For example:\nifconfig en1\n\n", "Q: How can I disable my iPad's screen turning on when there is a notification? I have an iPad mini 2. Also I'm using Telegram application. When someone sends me a new message into telegram, my iPad's screen will be turned on (light on).. and that's a huge problem for me .. Because I'm a member of lots of groups and channels  so I have more than 1000 new messages per day. And honestly I'm worried about my iPad's screen, I concern it will be broken, because it will be turn on/off constantly.\nAnyway is there any approach to I disable the relationship between \"my iPad's screen\" and \"new notifications\"?\n\nA: I think, you have two (or maybe three) possibilities:\n1. The \"Do not disturb\"-mode\nWhen the \"Do not disturb\"-mode is enabled, your iPad won't make any sound and does not turn on the screen, when you get a notification. But you can still see the notifications on your lockscreen, when you turn on the display manually.\n\n2. Turn of notifications for Telegram\nIf you turn of the notifications for Telegram, you won't be notified about any message. That would solve your problem, but I think you still want to see notifications for some of your chats?\n(3. Mute some chats)\nSince I'm not using Telegram, I'm not sure, if this is possible. But any modern messenger has options to mute individual chats for a while, so they won't send you push-notifications anymore.\n\nA: I stumbled upon this and there is now another way to receive notifications without having the screen light up.\nSwipe right on a notification and click on manage. Then click deliver quietly. Notifications will not alert you but are sent directly to the notification centre.\n", "Q: Format external HFS disk without ESP When formatting an external disk larger than 2GB, OS X automatically creates an EFI System Partition (ESP).  For compatibility with other devices, I want to format a large disk with only one partition, and no ESP.  How can I do this in OS X Yosemite?\ndiskutil eraseDisk HFS+ 002 disk2\n\nI found this Technical Note describing Apple's partitioning policy, but it doesn't say how to avoid creating the ESP.\nEdit: Forgot to mention I need to use GUID partition map for compatibility, not MBR.\n\nA: You can repartition the disk with gpt and format the partition with newfs_hfs:\nOpen Terminal.app and to get an overview enter:\ndiskutil list\n\nGet the partition table of the disk in question (below I assume the disk to partition is disk2):\nsudo gpt -r show disk2\n\nDestroy the GUID partition table and create a new one:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo gpt destroy disk2\nsudo gpt create disk2\n\nIf the disk previously was formatted as a FAT volume, a new GUID partition table can't be created because the PMBR turns into an MBR (which blocks the GPT creation) and you have to overwrite it first:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo gpt destroy disk2\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 count=1\nsudo gpt create disk2\n\nGet the new partition table:\nsudo gpt -r show disk2\n\nNow create a new partition with gpt. Depending on the block size of your disk you may have to align the partition. Disks with a block size of 512 Bytes have to be aligned. On disks with a block size of 4096 Bytes you can use the first free block (block nr. 6) and the size of the free space.\nExample (a 2.2 TB disk with a block size of 512 Bytes):\n       start        size  index  contents\n           0           1         PMBR\n           1           1         Pri GPT header\n           2          32         Pri GPT table\n          34  4292870077         \n  4292870111          32         Sec GPT table\n  4292870143           1         Sec GPT header\n\nDo the math and align your volume to 4k blocks. This means: the start block and the size is divisible through 8 (and has to fit in 4292870071 blocks in my example because the lowest recommended start block is 40). Create a new partition:\nsudo gpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 4292870064 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2\n\nwith i: index position (usually 1 for the first partition); b: start block; s: size in blocks and t: type of partition (here HFS+ = 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC).\nExample (a 6.0 TB disk with a block size of 4096 Bytes):\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2          4         Pri GPT table\n          6  976746229       \n  976746235          4         Sec GPT table\n  976746239          1         Sec GPT header\n\nsudo gpt add -i 1 -b 6 -s 976746229 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2\n\nFormat the partition with newfs_hfs (-v name: name the volume; -J: journaled):\n sudo newfs_hfs -v test -J /dev/rdisk2s1\n\nThe volume will be mounted automatically. Else enter diskutil mount disk2s1.\n\nBe warned: checking the disk with Disk Utility will yield:\n\nProblems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting...\n\nand with diskutil verifyDisk disk2\n\nStarted partition map verification on disk2\n  Checking prerequisites\n  Checking the partition list\n  Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting\n  Error: -69770: Partition map check failed because no slices were found\n\n", "Q: How do I close a Safari alert that's taller then the screen? \nOh, come on!

The issue has been fixed, however the MacBook lost its system partition data. The recovery partition is still there, but due to some issues (Read here), it never got upgraded to El Capitan's Recovery HD. Thus if I want to download the OS from Recovery Mode, it is installing Yosemite in it.  \nIs there any way I can reformat the MacBook and clean install El Capitan without first downloading Yosemite, installing it and then upgrading. I don't have any other Mac, but I do have a Windows Desktop. How can I possibly download and clean install El Capitan?\n\nA: The short answer is no. Without a different Mac you cannot download an El Capitan installer without first installing Yosemite on your Mac.\nOne way to do a clean install of El Capitan when only having one Mac and a Yosemite recovery partition is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Yosemite using the recovery partition. \n\n*Go to the App Store and download El Capitan.\n\n*Use createinstallmedia to create a USB installation of El Capitan.\n\n*Then you can use that usb media to format and do a clean install of your Mac.\n\n\nOptionally you could skip the usb installation steps all together and install El Capitan, let it upgrade the recovery partition for you and use the fresh recovery partition to format and reinstall El Capitan as a freshly installed OS.\nInstructions on how to use createinstallmedia can be found here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nAs a side note, have you tried if Internet recovery has a different version of the system compared to your local harddrive recovery.

Just 10 columns of plain text and about 300 rows.\nI'm using a registered version of office 2016 (for business) and Mac OS 10.11.6 (El Capitan).\nThis slow down appears when connected to the Internet.\n\nA: When I had a similar problem, disabling dropbox integration (I never realized I had enabled it) made a huge difference in performance, especially for otherwise trivial things in Office/Excel like copy and paste (which had become unbearable). \nSystem Preferences->Security & Privacy->Privacy Tab->\"Allow the apps below to control your computer\"  (dropbox was checked, I unchecked it). Not sure exactly what functionality this took away from dropbox, but it still syncs folders fine, which is all I used it for anyway.\n(I know this is thread is over a year old, but it's one of the first results in Google so I'm adding this for all the others who come along in hopes it may help them).\n\nA: I add excel to Accessibility, and it works fine for me, also I don't have Dropbox installed on my mac\n\nA: I believe there is an out of control process causing this that needs to be force quit to get performance back to normal.\nHere are my online findings on the topic:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/40b2in/why_is_office_2016_so_goddamned_slow_and_how_to/\n\n*http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macexcel/microsoft-excel-for-mac-is-so-slow/b6a1ff39-ec33-4d20-8093-e0cbe4abf902\n\n*http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macexcel/excel-2016-painfully-slow-while-moving-from-one/53463e80-ade9-43fb-96bd-904a5db3e514?page=3\nThe comments hint towards too many \"open ports\". Force quitting the excel process via activity monitor with the most ports seems to do the job. I suspect this is a registration connection issue..\nOffice tries to constantly connect home and check that the product is registered. If you are offline and then go online then the issue occurs. I'm guessing these open ports are in reference to internet connections to a registration server.\n\nA: This doesn’t answer the OQ because of the lack of technical\ndetails to pin point the origin of the problem. This is rather a general advice to get a more sure and performant working environment.\nI suggest you to install LibreOffice.\nOpen your file with it and compare your time to make a well defined scroll for example along 10 full pages, with just the arrows to limit human error.\nThe bigger is your benchmark files the more accurate will be your comparison.\n\nA: Select \"normal view\" instead of \"page view\".

Neither unfreezing pans/rows, adding Excel to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Accessibility nor using Normal View (my standard anyway) made any improvement in its performance. I didn't have Dropbox in my Privacy list.  Disconnecting from the internet improved the situation, however.  Copying is a little quicker, although viewing comments and using Hyperlinks are still unreliable.

The .dmg (disk image) file is not the actual installer. The .dmg must be double-clicked to install it before it can run any code. Even if you double-click it (so long as you leave the security feature Gatekeeper on), you must approve both the downloaded from the web alert and the authentication prompt to actually permit the install to proceed. \n\nIs there a possibility that by simply visiting a website that auto-installs a .dmg file, I could have compromised my security?\n\nNo, your security is not compromised unless you manually install the file. The reason for this is that a website can only offer a .dmg file for download. There is no \"auto-install\" for a .dmg app file. You may click on a link (or a button) to start the download, but disk images themselves are not \"installed\" by the download process—meaning they can't run any code on your Mac until you type in your password to install them (again, because of macOS's built-in security feature Gatekeeper). The disk image is merely saved to your designated folder (typically Downloads) then waits for you to take further action by double-clicking on it to mount it. For any code from that app to be run, you have to authenticate with your password. \n\nBonus tip: When a website tells you that your flash player is out of date by way of a pop-up like you've shown, that should be an automatic red flag! Outdated Flash Player alerts are almost never legitimate. Instead of clicking on that OK button on the notification like you did, you should force quit your browser: choose Force Quit from the Apple menu in the menubar ()—or just press Command+Option+Esc—then select Chrome/Safari and hit Force Quit. Hold down Shift while opening Safari to prevent the website from reloading.\n\nA: You are always safe when you don't open the DMG as the app is in a container and it can't execute itself.\nSecurity tips regarding downloads:\n\n\n*\n\n*You always get a popup question of OS X if you want to open this file.\n\n*OS X is standard secured to only open applications that are downloaded from the App Store. Even if you want to install a application that is not from the App Store you still need to disable the security (via Settings > Security and Privacy > press the lock in the bottom left corner, enter your passcode and set 'Anywhere'.)\n\n\nA: I'm going to make this easier for you to understand.\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I safe, if a suspicious file was downloaded but never opened or installed in my Mac?\n\n\n\nYes you are safe.\n\n\n\n*Am I safe, if I was redirected to an unknown website, when I clicked on a notification shown on another website?\n\n\n\nNo, not really. There are 99% chances, that you get infected by 0day exploits used by hackers, to turn your computer into their bot. In order to protect yourself from such hack attempts and attacks, always use popup & ad blockers, and avoid visiting sites, which redirect or opens popups.\n\n\nA: You are probably safe\nAs long as you don't open or install anything it is pretty hard to get a virus.\nIf you haven't disabled gate keeper (an internal system process that makes sure that software from unidentified developers does not open unless you type in an admin password to confirm that they are safe) you are 99.99% safe.\nFor future reference: A .dmg file is a disk image file. Even when you open a .dmg, it will only mount the disk. This means that it opens up a little folder on your desktop kinda like when you put a CD in your mac. You can't edit the folder, you can only eject it. To eject the mounted disk, just click the little eject button, or drag it to the trash can.\nHere is a quote from wikipedia  about disk images\n\nAn Apple disk image allows secure password protection as well as file compression, and hence serves both security and file distribution functions; such a disk image is most commonly used to distribute software over the Internet.\n\nHOWEVER:\nIf your browser keeps opening up these malicious advertisements, you may have adware already in your computer (check through your chrome extensions). Any extension that installs a new search engine is likely adware.\nPro tip: Install Adblock. It is damn near impossible to get a virus with Adblock unless your are actively seeking out malicious websites. Adblock will prevent sites from opening up these annoying pop-ups and will remove ads from youtube and basically every other site on the internet. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en-US\n\nA: All the answers here are great, but IMHO, all you need is to run some trusty anti-malware software like Malwarebytes.\n", "Q: Unsupported Macbook 4,1 (2008) on 10.10.5 (Supplementary) - No Audio After Update - What Next? NOTE: If you are not interested in how I got to this point, skip to the last paragraph.\nAs it currently stands, I have Mac OS X Yosemite running on my black Macbook 4,1. With the following kexts (in addition to the defaults provided by MacPostFactor), I was able to get OS X 10.10.2 running fully, with little-to-no issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel GMA X3100 kexts (provided via an installer)\n\n*IOAudioFamily.kext\n\n*AppleHDA.kext\n\n*Apple_iSight.kext\n\n\nI also installed the NoSleep extension, the Software Update Patcher (not before learning the hard way), the AirDrop Enabler, and the System Font extension (which changes the system font to the one used by the Apple Watch). In order to enable the kexts, I had to pull up KextDropper and enter this in the Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nvram boot-args= kext-dev-mode=1\n\n\nEverything (including Time Machine :) worked fine without modification after the update to 10.10.2 - except for the fact that I can't change the screen brightness (battery killer status confirmed).\nHowever, I did mention: \"not before learning the hard way\"...\nIn order to get to this version number, I had to update from 10.10.0, and when I did that update, I did it without the Software Update patcher. So, I ended up going into the Recovery Image, and deleting 'PlatformSupport.plist' from the Terminal (fun times?). Then, I rebooted into the fully-functioning 10.10.5 (Revision 1) OS X desktop. This, of course, was the easy part. I have now encountered the difficult part.\nWhat I am here to ask about is something that occurred after my update to 10.10.5, Revision 2. When I updated to 10.10.5 (Revision 2 - Recovery Update), everything continued to work, except for one thing - the Macbook is now back to having no audio support. I checked the boot arguments, and that revealed nothing. The kexts I installed are still in '/System/Library/Extensions'. I don't know what happened.\nThe main question(s): \n1) How can I get audio capabilities back for this version of OS X?\n2) Should I simply update to El Capitan (from App Store update) instead?\nPossibly related (but not identical in nature):\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Apple Stack Xchange | Installing Yosemite on Unsupported Macbook 4,1\"\n\n*\"MacRumors | Post by AtVusr, on Installing Yosemite on Unsupported Macbooks\"\n\n*\"MacRumors | Post by a02, on Installing Yosemite on Unsupported Macbooks\"\nThe last link was one of the first solutions I tested - Voodoo audio kext(s) weren't able to fix this :(\n\nA: Hello I've the solution.\nDownload this audio kext.\nDrag the two files AppleHDA.kext and IOAudioFamily.kext into the kext utility.app\nAfter all is ok you can reboot and it works :-)\nLink : https://mega.nz/#!9hcgFKRK\n\nA: I have the same computer, there is no hw acceleration for the gma x3100 drivers you are using.

I've checked that on German Amazon the very same model price is 700 Euros. The only concern I have is that previously I have only bought Apple products from Apple Stores, and I wonder whether it is safe to purchase iPhone from Amazon (or let's say, as safe as any other product sold on Amazon), or is it a 100% no?\n\nA: It depends on the seller. If it is direct from Amazon you should be fine. The big difference would be the return policies. \nIf it is from a reseller you want to make sure to check for activation lock https://icloud.com/activationlock and it may not come with a full warranty.

In the second configuration cmd_lalt_l/resc darkens and cmd_ralt_l/resc brightens the screen.\nKarabiner also allows you to define application-only key codes. By adding your app to /Applications/Karabiner.app/Contents/Resources/appdef.xml or to private.xml you can restrict the customized key code to your app's realm. Below the <identifier> tag you have to add a line <only>Your_App's_Name</only> then.\n\nDepending on your app you probably have to disable some other shortcuts too: e.g. cmdQ.

Anywhere you would use a script to copy or write a file, use that script to call defaults and set things appropriately. \nHere is a GitHub search to show you bash examples of using defaults write to get you started: https://github.com/search?l=bash&q=defaults+write&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=✓\nthe reason to not write an XML file to each user account is the separation of privileges. You need to handle new user accounts created after you run your script, you need admin rights and not user rights which will break a subset of your user's workflows and will impede adoption of your application. There is a framework for writing system level preferences for an application and then for a user to over-ride or customize those settings - my advice is to use those frameworks and make your life easier as a developer of software running on OS X.\n", "Q: Export Data From Couple Messaging App My girlfriend and I have been using the Couple messaging app [0] to keep in touch.

I found a way to get all your messages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Visit https://app.couple.me/ and log in.\n\n*Open a separate tab and visit https://app.couple.me/1/p/timeline (this may take a while to load depending on how many messages you have).\n\n\n*\n\n*This API is how it fetches your messages while you're scrolling (but it batches it by 55 messages at a time).\n\n*Let me know if this URL doesn't work. I don't believe it's user-specific (but the number 1 can seemingly be interchanged with numbers between 1 and 31). If you want to try and find it yourself, open up the Network Inspector in Chrome and scroll until a batch of messages has to be fetched. There should be a url with the word 'timeline' in it that shows up (you'll need to strip off anything passed 'timeline' from the url to get all of your messages).\n\n\n*You should now have a JSON representation of all of your messages.\n\n\n*\n\n*i.e. A lot should look like this\n{\n    \"eventType\": \"text\",\n    \"text\": \"A cat?\",\n    \"pairingID\": [redacted by me],\n    \"timeStamp\": 1345602786515,\n    \"itemID\": \"[redacted by me]\",\n    \"lID\": \"[redacted by me]\",\n    \"from\": \"yourcouplepartnersemailaddress@gmail.com\"\n}\n\n\n*Event types of 'text' allow you to see the texts you've written. Event types of 'image' have an image url you can download.\n\n\n*From the File menu, select 'Save Page As...' and save the file (onto your desktop and name it couple_backup.json if you want to use the tip below).\n\n*That's it!\n\n\nI'm not sure how comfortable your are with the JSON format. But all the data is there for the pickin'. In case you're not super comfortable, here's a way to get the JSON to be slightly more readable (only will work on a Mac):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal app.\n\n*Paste cat ~/Desktop/couple_backup.json | python -m json.tool > ~/Desktop/formatted_couple_backup.json into a Terminal window and hit Enter.\n\n\n*\n\n*This should format the JSON to make it more readable and save that to a file named formatted_couple_backup.json on your Desktop\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll create a Couple Exporter app one day to help people like us that could go through and automatically download all the images or something. This can work for now.\n", "Q: Does removing an iPhone from my icloud account also erase the data? I lost my iPhone 6S recently. I think it fell off my car and was crushed because it has been offline (according to Find My iPhone) ever since. I want to erase the phone and remove it from my iCloud account since the phone is gone.\nHowever, I can't erase the phone until it comes back online. I do have the option to remove the device from my iCloud account. If I remove the phone from my iCloud account, does that also erase the data? The phone has a password on it, will it continue to be locked in case someone finds it after I have removed it from my iCloud account?\n\nA: The erase command can't be delivered until the device connects to the internet. The same with issuing a passcode lock. \nThe device will remain unlocked, unprotected, unearned until such time as it connects to Apple's servers.\nThat being said, a destroyed phone is unlikely to be unlocked or even work, but there's a chance your data is vulnerable if you cannot assure destruction by locating it and shredding it (or equivalent).\n", "Q: Recover my iPhone 6s password I have misplaced my iPhone 6s password and it is saying it's disabled due to too many tries.\n\nA: Unfortunately your device needs to be erased by one of the following procedures\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've synced with iTunes, use iTunes.\n\n*If you're signed in to iCloud and Find My iPhone is enabled, use iCloud.\n\n*If you don't use iCloud and you can't sync or connect with iTunes, use recovery mode.\n\n\nApple has a support document describing the steps in detail, see If you forgot the passcode for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or your device is disabled.\n\nA: 1st way- \nIf your iPhone is connected to the internet, go to https://www.icloud.com/. Log in with your iCloud Id. Go to Find My iPhone, click on My Devices at the top middle of the screen. Click on your iPhone and click on the pop-up Erase iPhone. That should erase your iPhone and set it to the latest OS.\n2nd way-\nDownload the latest iOS for your phone from here. Connect your phone to your PC. Open up iTunes. SHIFT and Click on restore iPhone. Choose the downloaded IPSW file. Wait for iTunes to Erase your phone.\n", "Q: Cannot add more people to a group chat in iMessage How do I add people to an already existing group chat?\nThere are currently four people in the chat, three of the members are using an iPhone, and one is using a non-iPhone.\nI am trying to add another person to the group chat, how do I do this?\n\n\nA: You cannot add people to a group message if one or more of the people does not have an iPhone.  You also cannot add people to an already existing iMessage group chat if they do not have an iPhone.\nIn this case, one of the people that was in the group chat doesn't have an iPhone. (You can tell because it doesn't have a FaceTime option next to the call and message button.)\n\nA: I'm on iOS 10 Beta 7 (14A5345a) and while in the message if you tap on the \"i\" icon on top right you'll then have a button \"+ Add Contact\"\n", "Q: Help merging free space partition with Macintosh HD partition I installed and then un-installed Ubuntu 16.04 on my Macbook Air (OS X El Capitan 10.11.6). I had split the hard drive into 2 partitions - Macintosh partition of 60.6 GB and now I have a free space partition of 59.6 GB. I'm unable to merge these 2 partitions. I have included some screenshots below:\n\n\n\nOutput from diskutil list:\n\nOutput from diskutil cs list:\n\nOutput from sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0:\n\nI'd greatly appreciate any help.\nThanks,\nSophia\n\nA: Before issuing the command to merge the free space, you will need to fix an error in the GUID Partition Table (GPT). The \"Recovery HD\" labeled partition with the identifier disk0s3 has a GUID of 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. The correct value should be 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\nOne way, to correct this error, would be to boot from OS X Internet Recovery and enter the following commands in a Terminal application window. \ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0\ngpt remove -i 3 /dev/disk0\ndiskutil unmountdisk /dev/disk0\ngpt add -i 3 -b 119050312 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk0\n\n\nNote: The three keys you need to hold down to start \"OS X Internet Recovery\" are OptionCommand ⌘R.\n\nOnce the above commands have been entered, you can restart the computer back to El Capitan.\nThe Terminal application command to merge the free space is given below.\ndiskutil  resizevolume  /dev/disk0s2  R\n\nThis command will move /dev/disk0s3 to the bottom of disk0 while resizing /dev/disk0s2 to maximum size.\n"]
